86: Digital Rights Management,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/86:_Digital_Rights_Management,computers,"If you're interested in the subject, Lawrence Lessig's 'Free Culture' is pretty good","Digital rights management (DRM) is a class of methods for controlling digital files, such as by preventing media from playing on any device besides the device from which the purchase is made. It is used by several major companies, as it makes it more difficult to pirate media, which they claim cuts into their profits. Those companies typically also lobby for laws forbidding circumvention of DRM techniques, like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  However, DRM is usually disliked by consumers, as it makes it difficult to use their purchased media. For example, if they buy a new computer, there's no guarantee that their DRM-covered media will be usable on the new computer. Thus, Black Hat is suggesting to the pro-DRM organizations Sony, Microsoft, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and Apple that they stop their DRM-fiddling and lobbying, and he'll stop his inexorable ice-wall.  The title text refers readers to law professor Lawrence Lessig's book Free Culture.  There appears to be a larger version of Black Hat, drawn in pencil and erased, behind him. The smaller figure makes the inexorably advancing wall of ice appear correspondingly larger.","[Black Hat is standing on an advancing glacier] Black Hat: Dear Sony, Microsoft, the MPAA, the RIAA, and Apple: Let's make a deal. You stop trying to tell me where, when, and how I play my movies and music, and I won't crush your homes under my inexorably advancing wall of ice."
177: Alice and Bob,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/177:_Alice_and_Bob,computers,Yet one more reason I'm barred from speaking at crypto conferences.,"Any good cryptography presentation will include at least one story about Alice and Bob. They are the canonical ""protagonists"" of the crypto world, frequently used in illustrations to demonstrate how a cryptographic system works. (The names were mostly chosen to abbreviate to A and B, as well as being of different genders so that they can be distinguished by pronouns alone.)  Here, Randall casts the story in a different light. Instead of Alice and Bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private, Bob is actually having an affair with Alice, and his former partner, upset, cracked the encryption to see what the message contained. Nevertheless, the ""gossipy cryptographic protocol specs"" all took Alice's side (since the goal of any good crypto system is, of course, to succeed in this struggle).  The rest of the comic makes a few other allusions to cryptography:  Finally, in a twist ending, the girlfriend is revealed to be none other than Eve, the eavesdropper, who is also ubiquitous in Alice and Bob stories. Hell hath no fury, indeed.  The title text continues the theme of Randall getting barred from speaking at conferences due to his unusual take on certain topics.  To further spice things up, there are many other characters in the Alice/Bob canon, including Mallory, the malicious attacker, who wants to actually alter the message with nefarious intent; Craig, the cracker, who doesn't particularly care about the message but does care about the passwords used; Plod, a law enforcement officer attempting to access keys or data; and Chuck, a third party in the communication who secretly has a villainous intent.  Alice, Bob, and Eve are mentioned again in comic: 1323: Protocol","[Eve stands in the frame, talking to the reader.] Eve: I'm sure you've heard all about this sordid affair in those gossipy cryptographic protocol specs with those busybodies Schneier and Rivest, always taking Alice's side, always labeling me the attacker. Eve: Yes, it's true. I broke Bob's private key and extracted the text of her messages. But does anyone realize how much it hurt? Eve: He said it was nothing, but everything from the public-key authenticated signatures on the files to the lipstick heart smeared on the disk screamed ""Alice."" Eve: I didn't want to believe. Of course on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack. But I couldn't admit it until I saw it for myself. [Eve places her hands on her hips.] Eve: So before you so quickly label me a third party to the communication, just remember: I loved him first. We had something and she tore it away. She's the attacker, not me. Not Eve."
221: Random Number,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/221:_Random_Number,computers,RFC 1149.5 specifies 4 as the standard IEEE-vetted random number.,"The comic specifies a function (in a C-like syntax), which judging by its name should be designed to return a random number. Most functions of this form are random number generators, meaning that on subsequent calls they return different random numbers. But the programmer has instead implemented a function that just returns the same random number each time, which, while it could indeed have been truly randomly chosen by rolling a die as the comment documented, is essentially worthless were it ever to be called more than once (with the expectation of different, i.e., random, results).  In other words, the results over time would not be random at all, but completely predictable and deterministic.  The IEEE is the organization responsible for maintaining a number of computer standards. An RFC, or Request for Comments, is a formal document put out to computing experts by IETF in the hopes of becoming a future standard. However, RFC 1149 was an April Fools' joke, defining how carrier pigeons can be used to transmit Internet packets. ""RFC 1149.5"", meanwhile, simply does not exist.",int getRandomNumber() { return 4; // chosen by fair dice roll. // guaranteed to be random. }
224: Lisp,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/224:_Lisp,computers,We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.,"Lisp is a computer programming language with simple, highly regular syntax. The language's most notable feature is that programs take the same form as the language's primary data structure (the linked list). This blurs the line between code and data and permits programs to inspect and even alter their own source code, thereby opening up deep opportunities for metaprogramming. Lisp is also a functional programming language (though not purely functional, as some more recent languages are), meaning that programs are expressed in terms that are simple elaborations or extensions of the lambda calculus, a formal mathematical model of computation. This gives programs written in functional languages such as Lisp a distinctively abstract, mathematical form that is commonly considered difficult to fully grok (see 1270: Functional).  The phrase A suffusion of blue is a reference to Douglas Adams' book The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul. In it, an I Ching calculator calculates that everything above the value of 4 is a suffusion of yellow.  In the comic, Cueball marvels at the fundamental and complete nature of the language of creation that he sees in his dream. In the Lisp programming language, ""car"" is a primitive (i.e. basic) function that produces the first item in a list. The line ""My God, It's full of 'car's"" is a pun, most likely referring to the movie 2010: The Year We Make Contact, the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. In the book 2001: A Space Odyssey, when astronaut David Bowman accidentally activates a star gate, he exclaims as he enters it ""The thing's hollow — it goes on forever — and — oh my God - it's full of stars!"", although he does not say anything in the first movie during the final sequence.  In the second panel, Cueball remarks that, ""At once, just like they said, I felt a great enlightenment."" This is a reference to a pattern of observations among programmers and computer scientists that while Lisp often seems alien or arcane — even deliberately so, even to experienced hackers, even with repeated exposure over time — truly understanding Lisp in a deep, non-superficial way, results in a profound epiphany, a sudden and abiding illumination wherein one's preconceived notions about computation and programming are fundamentally transfigured, oftentimes over the course of a very short span such as during a single all-day hacking binge. Lispers commonly describe the experience as being akin to learning programming for the first time again; Daniel P. Friedman (author of much ground-breaking research and many popular introductory texts on Lisp and programming language design) described it as ""[learning] to think recursively,"" and contended that ""thinking about [functional] computing is one of the most exciting things the human mind can do.""  Cueball's remarks about patterns, metapatterns, and the disappearance of syntax are reactions to the elegant simplicity of the Lisp programming language, in which it is relatively easy to build immensely sophisticated programs using simple recursive elaborations of structure. This is fundamentally unlike the much more typical and common imperative programming languages, in which programs are written as chains of instructions for the machine to follow.  God replies that the universe was actually hacked together with the programming language Perl. Perl employs an idiosyncratic syntax that borrows liberally from a number of other languages. Although a versatile language often employed for assembling projects quickly (the much-loved Programming Perl introduces it as ""[the] language for getting your job done""), Perl has a reputation for being ugly and inelegant, partly as a result of its pidgin-like fusion of many inconsistent language elements and code styles. It was famously described as a ""Swiss-Army chainsaw,"" because it is very powerful but also unwieldy and unattractive. By way of contrast to Daniel Friedman above, Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, criticized the highly cerebral Lisp attitude toward programming with the words  The joke is that the Creator, like many software developers, was a bit rushed and chose to quickly throw together a working prototype rather than do the job right from the beginning; concurrently, that Cueball, thinking he has discovered an amazing and beautiful secret in the hidden world of Lisp, learns that in fact the real world is filled with ugly hacks and quick-and-dirty imperative code.  A (possible) hidden joke might be an oblique reference to Greenspun's tenth rule when God replies with ""I mean, ostensibly, yes."" Greenspun's tenth rule says that any sufficiently complex program written in another high level programming language will necessarily contain an imperfect, undocumented, slow, and bug-ridden implementation of about half of Common Lisp. Greenspun's tenth rule was meant to express the belief that Common Lisp, a large, full-featured Lisp dialect, is so flexible and robust that any attempt to render any really sophisticated program in most other languages requires the programmer to expend extraordinary effort unwittingly reinventing, in needlessly convoluted fashion, features and systems that would be elegant and trivial in Common Lisp. This explains why such a program might look or feel ""Lispy"" to an unfamiliar observer, and why the universe (if viewed as such a program) might look to mathematicians and scientists as though it probably has a beautifully simple mathematical basis, even if in reality it was just hacked together with a bunch of ersatz, special-case rules.  The title text continues the analogy by suggesting that the theory of quantum mechanics was written in regular expressions (""regexes""), a complex language for pattern matching used heavily in Perl. Regular expressions are often criticized as being a write-only language, that is, a language so complicated in syntax that any significant program written in them cannot be understood by anybody (often not even the original author). Documentation is essential to assist in the understanding of complex regular expressions. The title text claims that at some point, the documentation for quantum mechanics was lost, which explains why quantum mechanics is so bizarre and counterintuitive.","[Floating in space.] Speaker: Last night I drifted off while reading a Lisp book. Cueball: Huh? Speaker: Suddenly, I was bathed in a suffusion of blue.  [Floating in space before a vast concept tree.] Speaker: At once, just like they said, I felt a great enlightenment. I saw the naked structure of Lisp code unfold before me. Cueball: My God Cueball: It's full of 'car's Speaker: The patterns and metapatterns danced. Syntax faded, and I swam in the purity of quantified conception. Of ideas manifest.  [Close-up of floating in space before part of a concept tree.] Truly, this was the language from which the gods wrought the Universe.  [Floating in space with God appearing through a line of clouds.] God: No, it's not. Cueball: It's not? God: I mean, ostensibly, yes. Honestly, we hacked most of it together with Perl."
225: Open Source,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/225:_Open_Source,computers,Later we'll dress up like Big Oil thugs and jump Ralph Nader.,"Richard Stallman, or rms after his handle, is an old-school hacker known these days primarily for establishing the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and initiating the GNU Project in the early 1980s, which produced major portions of what would later be the GNU/Linux operating system. In this capacity, he's also known for being one of the most ardent and outspoken proponents of free software, sometimes called open source software. In fact, his advocacy is so emphatic and polemical that he has garnered active dislike from traditionalists who believe that software source code should be retained as a trade secret by its developer(s). Stallman has expressed that he did not even wish to be in a comic using the word Open Source (see the trivia section).  While this dislike may not rise to the level of hiring ninja assassins to remove him from the world, it is strong. The joke of the comic, as it also turns out, is that the two ninjas were just out to have a fun time teasing Stallman, and they seemed to know that Stallman's paranoia about Microsoft makes him sleep with no fewer than two katana swords near his bed. This type of sword was one of the traditionally made Japanese swords that were used by the samurai of feudal Japan. A ninja was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan. Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed ""dishonorable"" and ""beneath"" the samurai-caste, who observed strict rules about honor and combat. So this makes sense in this comic with Stallman, the samurai, and the ninjas, the lackeys of the oppressing Microsoft (at least in his mind). It also turns out that they specifically choose targets for their raids who have reason to be paranoid of larger companies that might send someone after them, and thus sleep with weapons near their beds. Stallman has received a Katana due to this comic (see the trivia section).  GPL refers to the 'GNU General Public License', which is a copyright license written by the FSF that covers much GNU software and plenty of other free software besides. It stipulates that software so copyrighted must always be provided along with full source code, and that everyone in possession of such software is free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it for any purpose whatsoever (including sale or resale), provided they give due credit to any other contributing developers, also provide access to the complete source code and retain all copyright notices.  Legally, this gives all users of such software exactly the same rights under copyright as the developer(s) and prevents any developers from ever taking away those rights from users, which is the defining feature of 'free-as-in-libre' software. It also has the effect of making all software derived from GPL software thereby also GPL, even if 'derived' merely means 'borrowed a few lines of code from'. Some (e.g. Microsoft's Steve Ballmer) have therefore argued that this makes GPL software behave as a kind of 'license virus', which spreads GPL-guaranteed freedoms to any software used in close conjunction with GPL'd software during development, such that businesses should actively avoid adopting free and open source software, so as not to jeopardize software developers' legal standing with regard to proprietary IP copyrights.  During the attack, Richard Stallman begins to speak like he quotes an old play. For instance, the wording ""For a GNU dawn!"" is pronounced ""For a g'new dawn!"", following the pronunciation of GNU, so it is a version of New Dawn, a sentence used often in fiction. He even gets annoyed when it turns out that the ninjas just run away. He had clearly waited a long time to, even looking forward to, defending himself with his katanas.  Because the two ""ninjas"" made a prank with him, and because they had so much fun out of Stallman, they plan to do more of these nightly raids, even mentioning two other possible future targets on their way out of the window:  Eric S. Raymond is a famous hacker who wrote The Cathedral and the Bazaar and has been something of an unofficial spokesperson for open source as a software development methodology. The plan to prank Eric Raymond could be a bad one, since he is an experienced martial artist, swordsman, and firearm enthusiast. However, this seems to be the attraction of these two ""ninjas,"" as can be seen by what they seem to know about their other possible target:  Linus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux kernel, a free/open source operating system kernel inspired by the Unix kernel, which proved to be the final component that, combined with then pre-existing GNU system functions and userland components, produced the first fully free operating system, Linux. The plan to prank Torvalds would at first sound more boring as the mild-mannered Finn, while known to be strongly, abrasively opinionated, is otherwise mostly harmless. However, one of the ninjas seems to know otherwise, since it is rumored that Linus sleeps with nunchucks in the same way that Stallman sleeps with two katana swords. The nunchaku is a traditional Okinawan martial arts weapon consisting of two sticks connected at one end by a short chain or rope.  A third possible target of this prank is mentioned in the title text. Ralph Nader is a famous consumer rights advocate, most famous for the 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed and for running for US President in 2000. Nader was an environmentalist, a member of the Green Party, and he supported clean energy, thus he should naturally be opposed to the Big Oil companies.","[The first panel has the second panel inside it. It also has a slightly light gray background color. Just above the inlaid second panel is Richard Stallman lying in his bed sleeping, the bottom part at the foot of the bed is hidden behind the second panel below. Below his bed under his head lies a katana sword in its sheath, and another one hangs in its sheath behind the end of the bed. Two ninjas with black cloth around their heads and swords jump through the skylight smashing it so glass scatters around them. Each of them is hanging one-handed from the same rope coming down from the skylight. The rope ends just above the inlaid frame below. The two ninjas shouts at Richard Stallman, from four speech bubbles that have pointy ends to indicate how the two alternately speak. (These bubbles are white not gray.)] Richard Stallman: Zzzz Top Ninja: Richard Stallman! Your viral open source licenses have grown too powerful. Bottom Ninja: The GPL must be stopped. Top Ninja:  At the source. Bottom Ninja: You.  [In the second inlaid panel (with normal white background), Richard Stallman wakes up immediately, and while sitting up in bed, he pulls out both his katana swords from their sheaths leaving the sheaths under and behind the bed. One hand is up in the air with the sword from behind the bed, and the other is still pointing down with the swords from below the bed. Lines indicate the fast movement of the swords. His three speech bubbles are like those of the ninjas, the last two even breaking the panel entering into the large first panel.] Katana swords: Shing! Shing! Richard Stallman: Hah!

Richard Stallman: ...Hey, where are you going?  [An outside scene at night with black sky. Richard Stallman's gray house can be seen with the broken white skylight on the roof. The ninjas are jumping out of a window at ground height while taking off their ninja cloth around their heads, holding them in their hand, thus revealing that they both look like Cueball. The first one is already on the grassy ground beneath the window, his sword pointing down and to the left; the other just jumps from the window pane, his sword pointing up and to the right. Again, they have speech bubbles like before. It is not possible to tell which of the two ninjas from before is first out the window.] Ninja in window: Man, you're right, that never gets old. Ninja on the grass: Let's do Eric S. Raymond next. Ninja in window: Or Linus Torvalds. I hear he sleeps with nunchucks."
234: Escape Artist,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/234:_Escape_Artist,computers,Easier to escape: n-layered nested quotes or an iron maiden?,"Harry Houdini (born Erik Weisz/Ehrich Weiss) was a famous escape artist, whose more famous routines included escaping straitjackets and switching places with an assistant while locked inside a box.  The word ""escape"" also has a meaning in computer science. To ""escape"" something in programming means to replace a character or character sequence that would usually have a special meaning with another character sequence that doesn't have this special meaning. One common way of escaping is to have a special escape character that removes the special meaning from whatever character follows it. For instance, many programming languages enclose text strings in quotation marks (e.g. ""this is a string""). If you tried to directly put a quotation mark inside the string, the compiler would interpret it as the end of the string. To avoid this, the quotation mark is escaped with a backslash: ""He said, \""Goodbye!\"", and went away.""  The problem Cueball is having is related to the fact that the Bash shell interprets spaces as a special syntactic marker, when he actually just wants the spaces to be literal space characters. In this case, escaping the spaces with \ would force Bash to interpret his script in this way.  (There is one other way the escape character is sometimes used, but we'll ignore it for the sake of explaining the comic.)  The person talking to Cueball is having a separate conversation about Houdini as Cueball thinks aloud about his script issue, which results in diverging conversations. This eventually leads Cueball to suggest that Houdini might have ""escaped"" (freed himself from) handcuffs by ""escaping"" (removing the special meaning from) them with backslashes.  Sometimes, escape characters need to be ""nested"" - the backslash character itself can be escaped as \\ to produce a literal backslash, so if, for example, one needs to produce a literal quotation mark to output to a script file, and that script file also needs to have the quotation mark escaped, one would need to type it out as \\\"", which would be output as \"". If I needed to actually output that \\\"", one would need to type it as \\\\\\\"". The number of backslashes needed grows, and can be very hard to keep track of (see 1638: Backslashes). This behavior is a type of n-level nested quotation mentioned in the title text. This could, in practice, be very easy with syntax highlighting showing where the parser sees the string as ending, making it trivial to escape out the characters that should be escaped, e.g.:  ""And then he said \""Hi\""."" In this example, the nested quotes could be escaped until the editor shows the uniform color of strings.   An iron maiden is supposedly a medieval torture device, currently believed to have been invented for tourism purposes much later than the time period when it was said to have been used. Harry Houdini's escapes include an escape from a purported ""iron maiden,"" although it only vaguely resembles the ""medieval"" torture device.","[Cueball sits before a computer on a desk while another man stands behind him.] Man: I was fascinated by locks as a kid. I loved how they turned information and patterns into physical strength. Cueball: Why does my script keep dying?  [Closeup on Cueball sitting at the computer.] Man: And a lock invites you to try and open it. It's the hacker instinct. Only your ignorance stands in the way. Cueball: Wait it's passing bad strings.  [Returns to the two shot of both men.] Man: I admired Harry Houdini, how he could open any lock and free himself from any restraint. Cueball: Ah - Bash is parsing the spaces.  Man: Sure some of it was fakery and showmanship. But I still wonder how he so consistently escaped handcuffs. Cueball: Backslashes? Man: Huh? Cueball: Never mind."
243: Appropriate Term,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/243:_Appropriate_Term,computers,"I know a lot of people hate these, but I prefer them to touchpads.","This is a simple comic offering increasingly not-safe-for-work names for the laptop's pointing device. This stick was an alternative to a mouse, and has largely been supplanted by the touchpad.  ""TrackPoint"" is the trademarked term used by IBM (and later Lenovo) for the pointing stick implemented on ThinkPad laptops. They are usually colored red, as in the illustration.  Other manufacturers have alternative names for their implementations, and typically use diferent colors.  The title text merely expresses Randall's preference for pointing sticks over touchpads.","[A diagram of a TrackPoint pointer on a keyboard, under which is a continuity line labeled ""Tone of Conversation-Formal to Informal."" There are four boxes under this line.] How to refer to the pointer thing on laptop keyboards Very formal: TrackPoint(tm)-style pointer Formal: Nub Informal: Nipple mouse Very informal: Clit mouse"
251: CD Tray Fight,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/251:_CD_Tray_Fight,computers,"This is silly, of course. The enemy will be born in the network.","This comic refers to the behavior of a tray loading optical disc drive of a desktop computer. When the tray is opened and the user is reaching for the disc, a process or task on the computer can, at that exact inopportune time, request that the disc drive close its tray. Alternatively, accidentally bumping the open tray may engage the auto-close feature, resulting in the same scenario.   This results in a sort of ""tug of war"" between the user who is trying to remove the disc and the CD drive trying to retract, and it is this tug of war that worries Cueball (or, more likely, Randall) that the ""Robot War"" is impending. The title text, however, points out that this fear is irrational, not because we'll always be able to win the tug of war (even if the computer reprograms itself to ignore our pull, we are physically stronger than the retraction mechanism) or because the act is ultimately pointless (it's an indignant protest at best), but because any robot war will, necessarily, have to start in ""the network"" to get any traction.  A Robot War is a recurring theme in science fiction where humans develop robots that become self-aware and start a war against humanity. A well known example of this theme is found in the Terminator franchise where, as the title text suggests, a military computer network (Skynet) becomes self-aware and starts a world war to kill all humans. This event is also parodied in 1046: Skynet.","[Cueball is standing, holding a CD tray which is half-in his computer. There are other CDs on the floor.] Cueball: Hey. Hey! Stop retracting my CD! I feel uncomfortable when my computer physically struggles with me. Sure, I can overpower it now, but it feels like a few short steps from here to the robot war."
297: Lisp Cycles,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/297:_Lisp_Cycles,computers,I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the MIT computer science program permamently.,"Lisp is one of the oldest high level programming languages. Despite being significantly ahead of its time, it never got enough traction outside of academia, and has never been widely used. However, it is considered to be a very powerful language even in the present day. Quotations regarding Lisp show that several big names in computer science and the tech industry hold Lisp in very high esteem. Eric S. Raymond goes as far as to say  Lisp is also famous for its use of fully parenthesized Polish prefix notation. As a result, Lisp programs take the form of enormous nested lists bounded by parentheses, and it is not uncommon to see the source code of a large Lisp program close off with an equally enormous stack of close-parens, representing the simultaneous termination of dozens of recursively and hierarchically nested functional and procedural structures.  In the first panel, Cueball praises Lisp, observing that no other language can match the awe that it still strikes despite its significant seniority.  In the second panel, Cueball proposes that new programmers might continue to learn Lisp forever; that despite the language's lack of widespread adoption, a small cadre of hackers will always exist who keep the language alive.  First, a little background:  Lisp was once the lingua franca of the frontier of computer science research at places like MIT's Project MAC and SAIL, and is still highly relevant in academic and theoretical computer science despite the subsequent emergence of many other highly functional research languages. That many of these venerable research institutions have vanished or declined, their faculties having split up or moved into the private sector, and the advanced and demanding course-work taught there using Lisp having been replaced by courses based around teaching languages-of-the-day (such as Java, Python, Ruby, and even JavaScript for web design) in a series of so-called AI Winters is a widely remarked upon feature of history. To many this conjures a nostalgic impression of the halcyon days of advanced computer research when funding for blue-sky exploratory coding was plentiful and most of the features of the contemporary digital world were first thought up and made real by wizardly hackers (the well-known purple cover of one venerated Lisp textbook is especially evocative, featuring a renaissance woodcut illustration of a sorcerous natural philosopher conjuring up magic with Lisp symbols superimposed into the image).  Throughout all this, Lisp, one of the first and greatest successes of theoretical computer science, has persisted, still in general though no-longer-universal use within the warrens of programming language and computability research, still studied by handfuls of students interested in something more than simply getting a job as a code grinder for Big Data, its features still inspiring generations of new language designers and implementers to do better (Ruby was designed — according to his admission — by Matsumoto Yukihiro as ""a bad rip-off of Lisp"" that would be ""nicer to ordinary people""; Java 8 introduced lambdas — in 2014!). David Thornley even noted that whether or not Lisp was a ""dead"" or moribund programming language is, in fact, a question older than almost all programming languages, and has been for decades.  The third panel references Star Wars. The ""old wizard"" Obi-Wan Kenobi, who remembers the culture and sophistication of the Old Republic (""Before the dark times. Before the Empire."") and lives as a hermit in the desert at the beginning of the film spoke these lines when passing on a lightsaber to Luke Skywalker:  The title text is also a reference to Star Wars lines:  The MIT mentioned in the title text is, of course, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an institution fundamental to the development of Lisp (and Scheme, which is a dialect of Lisp). For about 20 years, MIT taught Scheme in its introductory computer science course, 6.001 — Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (that course has since been replaced with a course teaching Python).","[Cueball is sitting at a computer, and Megan is standing behind the desk.] Cueball: Lisp is over half a century old and it still has this perfect, timeless air about it. Cueball: I wonder if the cycles will continue forever. A few coders from each new generation rediscovering the Lisp arts.

327: Exploits of a Mom,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/327:_Exploits_of_a_Mom,computers,Her daughter is named Help I'm trapped in a driver's license factory.,"Mrs. Roberts receives a call from her son's school. The caller, likely one of the school's administrators, asks if she really named her son Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--, a rather unusual name.[citation needed] Perhaps surprisingly, Mrs. Roberts responds in the affirmative, claiming that she uses the nickname ""Little Bobby Tables"". As the full name is read into the school's system's databases without data sanitization, it causes the student table in the database to be deleted.  The title of this comic is a pun. Exploit can mean an accomplishment or heroic deed, but in computer science the term refers to a program or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability in other software. In fact, one could say that her exploit is to exploit an exploit (her achievement is to make use of a vulnerability). The title can also refer to her choice of name for her son, which is rather extraordinary.  In SQL, a database programming language, commands are separated by semicolons ; and strings of text are often delimited using single quotes '. Parts of commands may also be enclosed in parentheses ( and ).  Data entries are stored as ""rows"" within named ""tables"" of similar items (e.g. Students).  The command to delete an entire table (and every row of data in that table) is DROP TABLE, as in DROP TABLE Students;.  The exploited vulnerability here is that the single quote in the name input was not correctly ""escaped"" by the software. That is, if a student's name did indeed contain a quote mark, it should have been parsed as one of the characters making up the text string and not as the marker to close the string, which it erroneously was. Lack of such escaping is a common SQL vulnerability; this type of exploit is referred to as SQL injection. Mrs. Roberts thus reminds the school to make sure they have added data filtering code to prevent code injection exploits in the future.  For example, to add information about Elaine to a data table called 'Students' the SQL query could be: INSERT INTO Students (firstname) VALUES ('Elaine');   However, using the odd name Robert');DROP TABLE Students;--  where we used ""Elaine"" above, the SQL query becomes: INSERT INTO Students (firstname) VALUES ('Robert');DROP TABLE Students;-- ');   By insertion of the two semi-colons in the odd name this is now three well formed SQL commands:  INSERT INTO Students (firstname) VALUES ('Robert');  DROP TABLE Students;  -- ');","[Mrs. Roberts receives a call from her son's school on her wireless phone. She is standing with a cup of hot coffee or tea (shown with a small line above the cup) facing a small round three-legged table to the right.

329: Turing Test,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/329:_Turing_Test,computers,Hit Turing right in the test-ees,"In brief, a Turing test is a test for assessing whether a machine/program demonstrates ""intelligent"" behaviour. Suggested by Alan Turing, the test involves a human examiner talking through a computer terminal to either a human or a computer — which it is, is not known to the examiner. If the machine/program's responses convince the examiner that he/she is talking to a human, the machine/program is said to be passing the test. This comic suggests that extra credit should be awarded if the machine/program is capable of ""counter-convincing"" the examiner that he's actually a computer.  The most common implementation of a Turing test Internet users may see is the CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Program to Tell Computers and Humans Apart), which is often found on web site registration pages and usually involves trying to identify letters/numbers in an image. The text in the image is often distorted and/or in different colors or sizes or fonts, or may be very blurry as if from a very bad photocopy. This is to deter an automated OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program from easily identifying the characters. The idea is that humans can process and decipher things from highly distorted pictures much easier than (current) computer algorithms can.  The caption makes a play on words, in that extra credit (optional additional work to perform) is sometimes offered on curricular examinations (""tests"") to allow the taker to increase his or her total score by demonstrating a heightened understanding of the subject, but the Turing test is not such a test. (This misapplication of vernacular associated with academic testing to a non-academic procedure that also bears the name test is a common vehicle of humor, as in ""what if I take a blood test, and don't pass?"" One may pass or fail an academic exam, but a blood test only identifies blood type, and the concept of passing or failing is not applicable.)  Similarly, the title text makes a play on words with ""test-ees"" vs testes suggesting that such extra credit would be an ironic twist to Turing test. (Hitting or kicking an adversary in the testes is considered dirty fighting.) This play on words is actually itself a form of aural CAPTCHA; humans can processes and recognize puns for what they are, but machines generally run afoul of the ambiguity.  A person with an appreciation for macabre humor will note that actually hitting Alan Turing in the testes would be rendered somewhat ineffectual by the fact that the British government chemically castrated him after he was convicted of ""gross indecency"" (Victorian-era code for homosexual acts between men) under the Labouchere Amendment in 1952. Whether or not this was intended by Randall is uncertain.","Turing test extra credit: Convince the examiner that he's a computer. Cueball: You know, you make some really good points. Cueball: I'm... not even sure who I am anymore."
341: 1337: Part 1,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/341:_1337:_Part_1,computers,"If you're not cool enough to do it manually, you can look up tools like Upside-Down-Ternet for playing games with people on your wifi.","This is the first part of five in the ""1337"" series. The title 1337 is ""L-eet"", or ""elite"", using the Leet alphabet, a coding system used primarily on the internet (and on early text messaging system), meant to provide a bit of obfuscation to plain text both to make it harder to read, and to show off in a creative way using in-group jargon. This comic series is aimed at elite hackers and programmers.  All comics in the series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  If a wireless network (WiFi) is unsecured it is usually a sign that the owner of the access point is not technically skilled enough to go into the admin panel and enable encryption. Obviously, someone in the area who wants to get on the net, but doesn't have a mobile data connection, will simply use this open access point. However, it is also common practice to leave open an access point to be able to claim that infringement of copyright may not have been the homeowner, but that anybody could have connected to the access point and started downloading files.  Another fun trick, for administrators of open APs, is to intercept pages and edit their contents. The only way to stop this is to create a secure connection, or tunnel, to a server to stop the admin from playing man-in-the-middle. Of course, as the title text says, Mrs. Roberts is so cool, she can edit the tcp stream live, without the help of programs, but then there is help to get with tools like the Upside-Down-Ternet, if you wish to play games with people misusing your WiFi.  Not only is Mrs. Roberts awesome enough to manually edit the live tcp stream, she's also manually ending individual VPN and SSH connections as Cueball's Cueball-like friend makes them - while  wearing oven mitts and baking cookies at the same time. He has been pwned (i.e. owned) by Mrs. Roberts.  The question ""How does she type with oven mitts?"" is likely a reference to the old web video site Homestar Runner and its character of Strong Bad, who answered emails while wearing boxing gloves. ""How does he type with boxing gloves?"" was the most common question he received. (Another unanswered question is how Cueball's friend knew she was typing with gloves on?' ...)","[Cueball talks to his Cueball-like friend who is lying down on the floor, using his laptop. Cueball is pointing at the laptop.] Cueball: You're not on the neighbor's WiFi, are you? Friend: Yeah, why? Cueball: The admin... plays games. Friend: No problem. I'll just hop on a secure VPN.  [Cueballs friend now sits on his knee in front of his laptop frantically typing. A message from the laptop comes out with a zig zag line] Friend: Whoa, my connections are dying as soon as I start to tunnel anything! Message on laptop: A VPN? How cute! And stop trying to SSH. Friend: Holy shit! Someone's inserting notes into the pages I request! Editing the TCP stream live! Friend: Nobody's that fast. Who is this admin?

342: 1337: Part 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/342:_1337:_Part_2,computers,Trivia: Elaine is actually her middle name.,"This is the second part of five in the ""1337"" series. The title 1337 is ""L-eet"", or ""elite"", using the Leet alphabet.  All comics in the series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  ""Like a ring in a bell"" appears to be a reference to the Chuck Berry song Johnny B. Goode, in which Berry describes a young boy (like himself) who becomes a guitar-playing prodigy. Apparently, Elaine learned to program as quickly, easily, and skillfully as Johnny (and Chuck) learned to play rock 'n' roll. Donald Knuth is a computer science Professor Emeritus at Stanford University who is famous for writing The Art of Computer Programming and developing the TeX computerized typesetting system. He may not have a mountain hideaway (a reference to Kill Bill, by the way as is the whole training sequence), but he would be one of the best mentors a budding hacker could have.  The A* search algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm are graph search algorithms. And what study of algorithms would be complete without a healthy study about finding complexities? Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute. Upper and lower bounds for complexity is written in Big O notation. Best possible execution of an algorithm is constant time, or O(1), said in words, for any given data set no matter how large the algorithm will always return the answer in the same time. However, constant time is extremely difficult to achieve; linear time (O(n)) is also very good. For more complex algorithms, O( n*log(n) ) is good, but O( n*log(log(n)) ) is better. (Note that logarithms in different bases are proportional to each other. So this would hold true for any base >1.)  From the evidence that Mrs. Roberts has two children, a daughter named Elaine, and a younger son named Bobby (presumably Little Bobby Tables aka ""Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--""), we can assume that she is the same mother from 327: Exploits of a Mom. Of course, the title text here explains that Elaine is only her middle name. In the title text to 327: Exploits of a Mom we learned that her first name is ""Help I'm trapped in a driver's license factory"". Mrs. Roberts appears to have had fun naming her children.","[Cueball standing an looking down at his Cueball-like friend, who is sitting on the floor near an armchair holding a cloth to his face.] Friend: So the greatest hacker of our era is a cookie-baking mom?

The computer appears to have been pieced together and there is a screwdriver lying next to her and an open box lies behind her. Little Bobby Tables (a kid version of Cueball) is painting with a broad brush at an easel to the left. There is a clear drawing with two parts going up and one down, but it's not easy to see what it should look like. He is holding his other hand up in the air, like he is enjoying the painting.] Cueball (narrating): Mrs. Roberts had two children. Her son, Bobby, was never much for computers, but her daughter Elaine took to them like a ring in the bell.  [The front of a car is in frame with side mirror and steering wheel visible.

Stick: swish Elaine: Memory usage! Donald Knuth: What would you use? Elaine: Dijkstra's algorithm!  [Donald Knuth and Elaine are outside, seen from behind while they are both writing on a chalkboard with a thick line down the middle to separate their work. On both sides their writing can be seen but it is unreadable. Where there is only text visible on Donald Knuth's side there is also what appears to be a drawing or matrix at the top of Elaine's. But a similar thing could be behind Donald Knuth's head. Elaine is no longer wearing her hair in a ponytail but have long straight white hair like her mom Mrs. Roberts. To the left there is a stump from a tree, some grass and maybe a poodle of water. Further back there is a small jagged hill and a flat horizon. To the right there are four mountain peaks and a flat high plateau towards the horizon. The frame of the panel does not include the top and bottom corner, but cuts a rectangular section of both places. In these two sections outside the panel is the last two paragraphs of Cueball's narrating:] Cueball (narrating): Until one day she bested her master Donald Knuth: So our lower bound here is O(n log n) Elaine: Nope. Got it in O(n log (log n)) Cueball (narrating): And left."

And I know I can trust him, because I asked if he was lying to me and he said no.","This is the third part of five in the ""1337"" series. The title 1337 is ""L-eet"", or ""elite"", using the Leet alphabet.  All comics in the series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  The comic is narrated by Cueball as seen in the previous comic, but that Cueball is not shown here, where the man drawn as Cueball is a real person:  Adrian Lamo is a hacker known for being a threat analyst and has penetrated many corporate networks. As far as we know, he has not penetrated any government networks, so helping Elaine physically break into the NSA would probably inspire second thoughts. The use of a rug to cross the barbed wire fence is likely a reference to a scene in Fight Club, where the same method is used to break into a liposuction clinic.  RSA is an encryption algorithm that allows decryption using public keys. No efficient method to break RSA is known. But if the NSA knew any such method, it would be unlikely for them to admit that. However, the NSA have paid RSA to put a backdoor into one of their encryption schemes.  Lawrence Lessig is a political activist focusing on copyright law and intellectual property, as well as a founding board member of Creative Commons.  Steve Jobs was the two-time CEO of Apple Inc. In partnership with Steve Wozniak he founded Apple. He oversaw Apple's return from near bankruptcy, the introduction of the original Macintosh, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. But in the 90s, most of this had not happened yet. The comic is implying that it was Elaine, in fact, who planted those ideas in Jobs' mind (while perching on his bedpost, a nearly-impossible physical task for even a relatively small and light human being - such a stance is often depicted for gargoyles or fictional vampires, the latter of which are associated with nocturnal bedroom-invasions like this).  The final panel is a pun on the Riot grrrls - Riot grrrl is an underground feminist punk rock movement. This metamorphosis in the hands of Randall into Riot Prrl - who presumably prefer to code in Perl. The real Riot Prrl are from Northampton and are into guerilla knitting.  The title text may refer to the urban legend that leads petty criminals to ask each other ""Are you a cop?"" the bottom line being that liars can lie about whether they're lying.","[Outside, Adrian Lamo is helping Elaine Roberts over a barbed wire fence.] It was the late 90's. Elaine crisscrossed the country with Adrian Lamo, the 'Homeless Hacker', learning to gain entry into systems both virtual and physical.

344: 1337: Part 4,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/344:_1337:_Part_4,computers,"Mrs. Roberts would have gotten up sooner, of course, but she was busy piping find ~ and find ~nomad into xargs shred, just in case.","This is the fourth part of five in the ""1337"" series. The title 1337 is ""L-eet"", or ""elite"", using the Leet alphabet.  All comics in the series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule. The comic is narrated by Cueball as seen in part 2 comic, but that Cueball is not shown here, but still he is part of this comic series, and thus also this comic.  In this part Elaine Roberts returns to the second best hacker in the world, (she being the best according to part 2), her mom Mrs. Roberts. Together they are an unstoppable force and they help out a guy called Jon with a CSS decryptor.  This implies that Jon Lech Johansen's DeCSS was written by Elaine. Jon Lech Johansen, also known as DVD Jon, is famous for DeCSS, a DVD decryption program that removes the copy protection from commercial DVDs. The Motion Picture Association of America, also known as the MPAA, were not amused.   Both the MPAA and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) use the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, shortened to DMCA, as a kind of brute club to silence ""infringements"" on their copyright. In a perfect world, the DMCA provides safe harbor protection to websites and consumers to make fair use of copyrighted content while also affording copyright owners the ability to protect their works from being pirated. In this world, this means that any content protection system, no matter how weak and poorly executed, cannot be circumvented and discussion of circumvention is illegal as well.  This is not a perfect world and in the end, the Roberts team is noticed and two men with black bowler hats and briefcases with the abbreviations MPAA and RIAA shows up at their house to arrest them. The two men look very much like Thomson and Thompson from The Adventures of Tintin.  When Elaine is not ready to let them arrest her, and draws her knife, they instead draw their katana swords, out of their (way too short) briefcases. Mrs. Roberts says to her daughter that she should calm down because it is illegal to slice people up in their own houses.  However, the two men disagree and refer to the DMCA Title IV, Section 408: Authorization of Deadly Force. So now the two women are in lethal danger.   But of course, Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU Project and stalwart defender of freedom and copyleft, cannot stand for this kind of repression of freedom. (In the real world, Stallman is not a swordsman, but he is always depicted with two katana swords in xkcd, first time was in 225: Open Source; there is also no Title IV, Section 408 of the DMCA; Title IV ends with Section 407.) In keeping with the ""Kill Bill"" themes from earlier in the series, Randall imagines the conflict between Elaine/Stallman/Mrs. Roberts vs MPAA/RIAA agents as an action-packed katana battle rather than the legal battle it would likely have been in real life.  The title text is talking about a Linux-ism. In Linux (and all Unix derivatives) ~ is a symbol for a user's home directory (usually /home/<username>). Presumably ""nomad"" is Elaine's username. find is an application that recursively walks a filesystem, listing all files, and xargs shred takes those files and securely erases each one with pseudo-random data. This is different from simply deleting a file, which merely removes the pointer in the filesystem's record tables to the file's location on the hard disk. The latter can usually be recovered from. Secure delete, however, requires physically taking apart a disk and reading individual bits for remaining magnetic charge to attempt to reconstruct what was there.  Proprietary hardware is hardware (the electronics part rather than the software) created and uses only by that company as opposed to open hardware that uses parts or chips common to everyone. Proprietary hardware used to found in most gaming consoles and apple/mac devices but that isn't as common now since the cost of designing your own hardware is too expensive compared to using common chips.","[Elaine is sitting under tree on a grassy meadow typing on her laptop.

345: 1337: Part 5,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/345:_1337:_Part_5,computers,This digital music thing will probably reach its endgame sometime in the next decade or so. These are very exciting times.,"This is the fifth and last part of five in the ""1337"" series. The title 1337 is ""L-eet"", or ""elite"", using the Leet alphabet.  All comics in the series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule. The comic is narrated by Cueball as seen in part 2 comic, but that Cueball is not shown here, but still he is part of this comic series, and thus also this comic, as he narrates the epilogue.  Richard Stallman is the ardent defender of freedom and believer in copyleft, he also founded the GNU Project. (He is not really a sword fighter but is always depicted with swords when featured in xkcd, which is in this series and in 225: Open Source).  In the previous part he came to the rescue of Mrs. Roberts and her Daughter Elaine Roberts. Stallman and Elaine quickly overpower the two enemies with black bowler hats that represent the Motion Picture Association of America, (MPAA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) use the Digital Millenium Copyright Act who had found out about the Roberts hacking.  Just when the two men have been defeated Elaine asks how Stallman knew they where in trouble and he tells it was his friend that told him about it. The friend enters by climbing down a rope from the sky with red cape and goggles. It turns out it is Cory Doctorow, a blogger, journalist, and science fiction author who serves as co-editor of the weblog Boing Boing. He is an activist in favor of liberalizing copyright laws and a proponent of the Creative Commons organization. He does not really travel around in a balloon or (usually) wear a red cape, but Randall introduced this idea in 239: Blagofaire and has continued it in later comics featuring Cory Doctorow. So he in climbing down from his balloon.   He uses the balloon to construct the Blogosphere, which is a name used to refer to all blogs on the Internet, many of which frequently link to and refer to other blogs. Here, the Stallman character talks about it as though Cory Doctorow actually constructs it and  Cory Doctorow talks about it as if it were a portion of the atmosphere 20 km up over the tag clouds...   Blogs often label posts with keywords, known as tags. A tag cloud is a way of displaying the tags on a site where the more common tags appear in larger type than less-common ones. It has no relationship to actual water vapor clouds in the sky, but in the comic, the Doctorow character suggests that tag clouds are actually in the air, below the new blogosphere.  At this point we see that Mrs. Roberts is still programming while this fight and discussion takes place. Her son Little Bobby Tables comes and tells her he is hungry, but she tells him that she does not have time when she is coding, and that he ate yesterday. It seems that he is still a kid, even though it must have been some years since the young Elaine left and grew up. However, she may still be a very young adult, in which case her little brother could still be shorter than his mom (we see in Part 2 that, from age 11, she studied with Donald Knuth for four years, making her 15 when she left. However, it is not clear how long she was away from home after that).  Stallman gives Elaine a proposal to join GNU as a coder. GNU is supposed to be the pinnacle of open source; an operating system with no restriction, allowing the user to modify and customize anything they want about the computer. Stallman likely wants Elaine for her coding abilities, similar devotion to open source and freeware, and use her reputation as a hacker and open source pioneer to spread the word and further his project. This may also be a reference to the infamous ""Free Software Song"", [1]sung by Stallman in which he exhorts hackers to ""join us now and share the software"".  But she is not ready yet as she wished to take down the industry of MPAA and RIAA as Music doesn't need these assholes. In the meantime Cory Doctorow throws the bowler hat guys out and asks them never to ""darken our comment threads again"".  Stallman is against her idea of going for straight war with the industry, and suggest she helps encourage sharing in the public mind. And then Doctorow chimes in with a suggestion that she has the ability to build a better P2P systems. To which she asks if they mean straight up piracy? And this leads up to the punch line of the pun, when Doctorow says she would make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts!  Peer-to-peer (often abbreviated P2P) system is a network system where tasks are partitioned between participants with equal privileges, in contrast with the client-server model, where the client makes requests and the server provides service. A common example of a peer-to-peer system is the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol, which is often (mis)used for distribution of pirated software and media.  The Dread Pirate Roberts is a fictional character from the book and movie The Princess Bride. Roberts is the most feared pirate on the seas. But, ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" is merely a title that has been passed down as previous ""Roberts"" have gained enough money (from piracy) to retire comfortably. Westley, one of the main characters from The Princess Bride, becomes the Dread Pirate after being taken prisoner by the preceding Pirate Roberts. It is anyone's guess whether the entire 5-comic story, starting from the choice of Mrs. Roberts' name, began as just a lead-up to this one joke. At the end of the movie, Inigo Montoya has won the vengeance he has sought all his life, and expresses to Westley that he doesn't know what to do next. Westley suggests Montoya succeed him as Roberts, saying, ""Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts."" Cory Doctorow's line in the comic therefore mimics that line from the movie.  Silk Road was an online black market designed to allow criminals to trade in drugs, guns and other illegal items, run by a person also using the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts. However, this black market did not exist until four years after this comic was published.  In the epilogue several items of interest is revealed about the Roberts later life.   Elaine shared her ideas with Bram Cohen who went on from that to found BitTorrent, a distributed method of downloading files. People can and do use BitTorrent both for lawful file downloads and also for sharing media files unlawfully. Its distributed nature, where someone does not download a file from just one other computer but rather in many pieces from many other computers with the same file, makes it more difficult for record and movie industry groups to police, and therefore a person with Elaine's motivations might be interested in helping design such a system.  Mrs. Roberts developed for Ubuntu which is probably the most well known distribution of GNU/Linux. A GNU/Linux distribution (often referred to simply as ""Linux"") is any operating system that is based on GNU software and the Linux kernel.  She also went after any website (defacing them) that made Your mom jokes about her daughter. To deface a website is like putting up graffiti or tearing down signs; she likely replaces the url's content from the original site to another image, text box, or other message as revenge. This is a recurring theme on xkcd. Defacing websites is generally considered a low-level hacking activity, generally carried out by script kiddies using pre-packaged exploits rather than by highly skilled hackers like Elaine.  Finally a bit more info is given on how Elaine continues her fight, joins communities, help with codes etc. And then sometimes she streams her music live on a IP address, and if you happen to find one of these with a streaming audio player you can hear her rock out (a reference to her music career mentioned at the end of the third part).  The final phrase ""Happy Hacking"" often accompanies an autograph from Richard Stallman.  The title text is likely referring to the argument over Digital Rights Management, or DRM-locked content. These so-called 'DRM wars' are concerned about how DRM restricts the freedoms of people who buy them legitmately, and how it restricts creativity and innovation on the internet. A large part of the debate is digital music, or music you would buy and download on the internet through sites like Amazon or iTunes. The title text states that the DRM wars will end in the next decade or so and we are living through very exiting times as we can see these wars unfold and eventually end.   In 2009, iTunes did remove DRM from any music they sold, which was a huge milestone at the time. Due to the rise in music streaming services (all of which use DRM to keep clients from downloading their songs) in the mid- to late 2010s this achievement has been made void again.","[The two men in black bowler hats (RIAA and MPAA agents as known from the previous comic) with their katana swords are attacked by Elaine Robert with her folding knife and Richard Stallman with his own two katana swords. Elaine kicks the RIAA man to the left in the back of his leg, while Stallman jumps over the MPAA man to the right, flying high over him from right to left in a flying maneuver hitting his sword while hanging parallel to the ground above the man.] Elaine: Thanks, Stallman! Richard Stallman: 'Tis my pleasure.  [Elaine stands to the left with her knife in one hand having folded it down again. Richard Stallman stands between the two men with bowler hats who are now lying on the floor on either side of him each with one of Stallman's sword pointing at their throat. Stallman has both arms fulle stretched towards them as he looks straight out of the panel. The left (RIAA) man lies flat on his back his hat and katana sword lying behind him. The right (MPAA) man is sitting on his knee leaning as far back as he can, since the sword is almost touching his skin on his throat. He wears his hat, but the sword lies behind him, out of reach, even though he is leaning back on one hand close to it. To the far right a rope comes down from the top of the panel falling down on the ground so a section of it stretches even farther right in the picture. Down this rope comes a man with googles and a red cape, which is black on the inside. This is Cory Doctorow. He holds on to the rope with two hands one over one just under his head.] Elaine: So, wait - how did you know we were in trouble? Richard Stallman: My friend here was tracking these thugs from his balloon.  Richard Stallman: He called me and I thought I'd stop by Cory Doctorow: -Hi!  Cory Doctorow: -Cory Doctorow - It's a pleasure to meet you.  [Elaine has shifted the knife to the other hand. Richard Stallman has moved to the left of the RIAA man, so both bowler hat men are between him and Cory Doctorow. Stallman still points his sword in their direction, but they are lowered. The RIAA man closest to him, has picked up his hat in one hand and reaches for his sword with the other hand. The MPAA man now lies on his back, one arm up leaning on the other. His sword is gone. It does not seem like Doctorow could have taken it. Behind him Doctorow has reached the ground, the rope hangs behind him. He points left.] Elaine: Balloon? Richard Stallman: Aye. They're up there constructing something called a ""Blogosphere."" Cory Doctorow: Yup! It's twenty kilometers up, just above the tag clouds.  [The scene is contracted, so to the left Mrs. Roberts at her desk with her chair and laptop becomes visible (from the previous comic). This witout the other people have moved closer. She still types as her son Lille Bobby Tables enters and lifts a hand in his mothers direction. He is drawn as a child version of Cueball. Elaine has put the knife away, and looks at Richard Stallman who now stand straight looking at her, with the swords crossed in front of his legs. Behind him just right of the rope hanging down, Cory Doctorow lift one of the bowler hat guys up by the throat while looking right and talking to him. The other bowler hat guy has left the panel. The one he holds has his hat but no sword.] Little Bobby Tables: Mom, I'm hungry. Mrs. Roberts: Hush! I'm coding. You ate yesterday. Richard Stallman: You know, Roberts, GNU could use a good coder like you. Ever thought of joining us? Elaine: Maybe someday. Right now I've got an industry to take down.  Elaine: Music doesn't need these assholes. Cory Doctorow: Begone! And never darken our comment threads again!  [Zoom in on Elaine, Richard Stallman and Cory Doctorow. She stand straight looking at Stallman who faces towards her swords now on his back crossed. Doctorow is also facing her and holds out both arms towards her. The rope is now outside the panel as are both bowler hat men.] Richard Stallman: Well, you won't fix the industry with random exploits. You need to encourage sharing in the public mind. Doctorow: Hey; With your music and coding backgrounds, you should get into building better P2P systems.  [The final panel is only a third of the length of the previous panel. The three are still in the panel but they have moved and are also drawn somewhat smaller. Elaine still faces them right, but now Cory Doctorow is in front of Richard Stallman swords as before.

You'd make a wonderful dread pirate, Roberts  [To the right of the final panel is a two column epilogue narrated by Cueball as seen in part 2. It is split in three paragraphs and a ""signature"".

349: Success,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/349:_Success,computers,40% of OpenBSD installs lead to shark attacks. It's their only standing security issue.,"This comic refers to a common experience in which attempts to improve or change something can get you into even worse trouble, and where just getting back to the state at which you started becomes an arduous or even impossible task. Here, this idea is taken to a ridiculously (and amusingly) extreme level, where the attempt to install an operating system snowballs into ever more complicated problems, resulting in Cueball and Megan somehow literally getting themselves in deep water.  The OS they are trying to install is OpenBSD, an open source Unix operating system which, like some other Unix variants, is notoriously difficult to install and configure correctly, especially on home desktops with less common hardware profiles, and especially compared with the more popular Windows operating system.  The title text is a reference to OpenBSD's premium on security. For a time, their slogan was ""Five years without a remote [security] hole in the default install!"" This was eventually changed to ""Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!"" That their only standing security issue would be shark attacks is effectively an acknowledgement that any attempts to install the OS will only lead to getting stranded in the middle of the ocean.  This comic was referenced later in 1350: Lorenz. Trying to install BSD was also referenced in 518: Flow Charts. The last panel in 1912: Thermostat may explain how this comic ended.  This comic follows a similar storyline to 530: I'm An Idiot and 1518: Typical Morning Routine, as Cueball and Hairy respectively in these comics, encounters an issue and attempts proceedingly more absurd solutions to the issue.","As a project wears on, standards for success slip lower and lower.  0 hours [Megan looking at Cueball working on the computer.] Cueball: Okay, I should be able to dual-boot BSD soon.   6 hours [Cueball on the floor fiddling with the open tower in front of him.] Cueball: I'll be happy if I can get the system working like it was when I started.   10 hours [Cueball standing in front of the computer which now has a laptop plugged into the tower.] Cueball: Well, the desktop's a lost cause, but I think I can fix the problems the laptop's developed.   24 hours [Cueball and Megan swimming in the sea, island and beach seen in the distance.] Cueball: If we're lucky, the sharks will stay away until we reach shallow water. Megan: If we make it back alive, you're never upgrading anything again."
371: Compiler Complaint,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/371:_Compiler_Complaint,computers,Checking whether build environment is sane... build environment is grinning and holding a spatula. Guess not.,"A compiler is a program that converts code into machine instructions that a computer can run. A Pointer is a variable within a computer program that is used to reference a memory location. A Segmentation Fault (segfault) is an error that occurs when a program attempts to access an invalid section of memory. Segfaults usually cause a program to crash in an ungraceful fashion and fixing them can be difficult. Contrary to the comic title, segfaults occur during Run time (program lifecycle phase) and as such are not associated with a compiler.  In the comic, the computer starts talking to Cueball and compares a segfault with the unpleasant feeling one gets when they experience a hypnic jerk. The computer then tells the programmer to ""double-check your damn pointers,"" as segfaults usually arise from a program attempting to access memory that is referenced by an invalid pointer.  The title-text references GNU-style autoconf configuration scripts. These scripts check certain features of the system they're running on in order to build a program correctly; for example, certain systems expect system calls to occur in a specific way, and the autoconf script will detect this and alter the program to match the expectation. Invariably (and memetically), these scripts include a check to determine ""whether the build environment is sane."" This actually checks whether the path to the current folder has ""unsafe"" characters, and whether a newly created file is older than the script itself, which could indicate a very esoteric filesystem, a corrupted source archive, or just a system clock that's set incorrectly; however, since these file modification dates are an important part of how the autoconf script does its work, it can't go any further in an ""insane"" environment. In any case, the joke is that an insane build environment is nothing like an insane person, yet Randall is equating the two.","[Cueball sits at a computer, hand over the keyboard.] Computer: Okay, human. Cueball: Huh? Computer: Before you hit ""compile,"" listen up.  Computer: You know when you're falling asleep, and you imagine yourself walking or something, and suddenly you misstep, stumble, and jolt awake? Cueball: Yeah!  Computer: Well, that's what a segfault feels like.  Computer: Double-check your damn pointers, okay?"
376: Bug,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/376:_Bug,computers,The universe started in 1970. Anyone claiming to be over 38 is lying about their age.,"In computer systems, time is measured starting from some arbitrarily chosen point. That particular time is known as the ""epoch"" for that system. The UNIX operating system internally uses an epoch of January 1, 1970, and measures the time as a number of seconds from then. Since this was intended only for things internal to the OS (File last modified times and the like), using 1-Jan-1970 was safe as no UNIX systems existed before that date. Dates before 1 January, 1970 are represented by negative values.  Commonly known as the year 2038 problem, at 03:14:08 on 19 January 2038, the 32-bit versions of the Unix time stamp will cease to work, as it will overflow the largest value that can be held in a signed 32-bit number. The 64-bit version ""will"" expire at 15:30:08 on 4 December 292,277,026,596.  Cueball has clearly misused the system date in some way (possibly by square rooting the timestamp with the assumption that 0 is 12:00:00 on Jan 1st, 0 CE, which would require the use of imaginary numbers and would mean his output would probably be wrong anyway,), his friend makes a pun by combining ""Epoch"" with ""Epic Fail"" - a colloquial term meaning ""a very big mistake was made"".  The title text takes the joke to the next level, claiming that the entire universe began when Unix did, and therefore no one can be older than 38 at the time of the release of this comic, 2008. This would now be 47 as of 2017 (the formula is 'x - 1970', where x is the current year), which would explain the bug since no earlier dates would be needed. This is also similar to Last Thursdayism.","[Cueball sits at a computer, staring at the screen and rubbing his chin in thought. A friend stands behind him.] Cueball: Weird — My code's crashing when given pre-1970 dates. Friend [pointing at Cueball and his computer]: Epoch fail!"
380: Emoticon,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/380:_Emoticon,computers,"U+FDD0 is actually Unicode for the eye of the basilisk, though for safety reasons no font actually renders it.","A basilisk is a legendary creature reputed to have the power to kill with a single glance. In this comic, Cueball learns much to his dismay that the basilisk's power is fully compatible with the 21st century, and can kill you just with a smiley emoticon over instant messaging.  Cueball's request for A/S/L is a standard question when first meeting someone online; it asks for age, sex (gender) and location.  The title text mentions U+FDD0, which in reality is the code for a ""non-character"" in Unicode.  U+FDD0 did in fact kill at least one chat client at the time. Konversation in particular. (and presumably any other Qt-based chat clients using QTextDocument)  ""basically u+fdd0 (eye of basilisk, the snake) is in a char range that's marked for interchange and illegal in utf-8""  ""but qt's utf-8 encoder let it through anyway""  ""but it just so happens that qt's qtextdocument uses u+fdd0 as text frame delimiter""  ""so when you append it to a qtd, counters run wrong and eventually you crash""  ""d-bus closes the connection and crashes the client when it encounters illegal utf-8, and kde's notification system works through d-bus""  The problem was fixed after the xkcd ""report"" and Konversation now handles unicode normally.","[Cueball sits at computer, typing.] ~!~ Opening Chat with BSLSK05 <NICKM> Hi! <NICKM> A/S/L? <BSLSK05> :) [Cueball looks stunned, flies backward.] [Two smaller frames focus in on BSLSK05's emoticon, implying rotation to show a smile and two open eyes.] [Cueball at computer slouches in chair, dead, crossbones above his head.] [At the remote computer a basilisk is looking at its screen.]"
394: Kilobyte,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/394:_Kilobyte,computers,I would take 'kibibyte' more seriously if it didn't sound so much like 'Kibbles N Bits'.,"This comic pokes fun at the confusion over the definition of a kilobyte. Some interpret the prefix literally, meaning a kilobyte is 1000 bytes. Others, however, usually define it as 210 = 1024 bytes, because it is computationally easier to deal with.  The first row of the table is simply mocking this discrepancy.  The second row is Randall's interpretation on how Stan Kelly-Bootle would approach this problem. Kelly-Bootle is known for writing The Computer Contradictionary which satirizes the jargon and language of the computer industry. Kelly-Bootle was likely motivated to write this work after working for several years at IBM, a company infamous for its excessive use of acronyms in the work place. Averaging the two definitions together to get 1012 bytes is simply a humorous approach that Kelly-Bootle would likely have taken (""Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration."" — Stan Kelly-Bootle). The serendipitous fact that the initials of Kelly-Bootle's name are ""KB,"" the same letters used to abbreviate the word ""kilobyte,"" adds a layer of plausibility to the joke.  The imaginary kilobyte simply plays on the fact that complex analysis is required in quantum computing in relation to quantum mechanics. The imaginary number is represented as i and has a value of the square root of -1. This is a pun on the fact that KiB is used for the ""binary kilobyte"" (occasionally ""kibibyte"") which is standardized at 1024 bytes.  The Intel kilobyte mocks the Pentium floating point unit which, in 1994, became notorious for having a major flaw in its floating point division algorithm that gave slightly erroneous results. (For the non-computer folk, a floating point number is a real number like 4.0 or -13.387.)  The smaller, drivemaker's kilobyte mocks a business model for handling higher prices that keeps prices constant but reduces quantity. The food industry has been notorious for decreasing quantity of food and keeping prices the same instead of increasing prices and keeping quantity the same. Randall is suggesting that if the computer industry tried to do this with hard drives, it could have humorous results such as smaller number of bytes in a kilobyte. In reality, hard drive capacity is specified in 103 byte (kB) units, while the content you put on it (programs etc.) is specified in 210 (KiB) units. Formatting the drive, i.e. making it usable for storage, further decreases the available space. Thus a 250 GB drive might be reported to have a capacity of only 232 GB (really GiB) by the operating system. This discrepancy increases with increasing drive size. The trend humorously suggested in the comic, however, would make the drivemaker's kilobyte 1024 bytes in 1979, 1000 bytes in 1985, 872 bytes in 2017, and 0 bytes in 2235!  The baker's kilobyte is a play on the baker's dozen, which is 13 instead of 12. A baker's byte with 9 bits to the byte would result in a total of 9216 bits in a 1024 byte kilobyte. Converting this into ""normal"" bytes (with 8 bits), we divide 9216 bits by 8 bits per byte to get 1152 8-bit bytes to the baker's kilobyte.  At the title text Randall mentions the definition kibibyte, which is defined more precisely. The binary prefix kibi means 1024, a portmanteau of the words kilo and binary. But he doesn't like the word because it sounds like the dog food Kibbles 'n Bits.","There's been a lot of confusion over 1024 vs 1000, kbyte vs kbit, and the capitalization for each. Here, at last, is a single, definitive standard: [table of various kinds of kilobytes]    SYMBOL  NAME  SIZE  NOTES   kB  Kilobyte  1024 bytes OR 1000 bytes  1000 bytes during leap years, 1024 otherwise   KB  Kelly-Bootle standard unit  1012 bytes  compromise between 1000 and 1024 bytes   KiB  Imaginary kilobyte  1024 √-1 bytes  used in quantum computing   kb  Intel kilobyte  1023.937528 bytes  calculated on Pentium F.P.U.

416: Zealous Autoconfig,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/416:_Zealous_Autoconfig,computers,I hear this is an option in the latest Ubuntu release.,"Cueball is seen in an attempt to connect his laptop to a Wi-Fi network using, as the comic title suggests, a particularly zealous ""Wifi Autoconfig"" utility — ""zealous"" being a synonym for ""eager"" or ""enthusiastic"". The utility manages to find a secure access point named ""Lenhart Family"", presumably Miss Lenhart's home Wi-Fi access point, and attempts to connect to it.  Instead of requesting a password, the program automatically begins a dictionary attack, entering in various commonly-used passwords in the hopes that Miss Lenhart has little regard for proper security measures (a flaw shared by many computer users). When this fails, the program attempts to exploit a WEP vulnerability, which surprises Cueball. This also fails, possibly because Miss Lenhart used WPA instead of WEP.  In the third panel, the autoconfig then connects to Cueball's Bluetooth phone and uses it to call a local school in order to locate the Lenhart children, which are attending there, and it reports that it has found them. It acts on this information in the fourth panel, notifying ""field agents"" to kidnap the Lenhart children, and then reports that the children are acquired (very fast it seems). With the children as hostages, the program begins negotiations with the parents, offering their safe return in exchange for the Wi-Fi password.   This puns on the computing sense of ""negotiation"": network protocols (such as HTTP) often specify routines whereby a server and a client computer can agree on the best format in which data can be transferred. This is called content negotiation or format negotiation (see for example section 3.4 of the specification for ""semantics and content"" in HTTP).  Cueball, frightened by these actions, repeatedly presses Ctrl+C in an attempt to cancel the process, with little success. Ctrl+C is used to abort programs started from a terminal (Unix/Linux) or a command line prompt (cmd.exe under Windows). Part of the humor is that he only attempts to cancel quite late in the process, well after (for instance) the school was first called.  The title text mentions Ubuntu, a Linux distribution that attempts to be as user-friendly as possible. Randall mentions that he has heard that this ""user-friendly"" Zealous Autoconfig option has already been installed in the latest Ubuntu release...  Problems that arise when you leave decisions to a computer program are also explored in depth in comic 1619: Watson Medical Algorithm.","[Cueball sitting on a chair with his laptop in his lap.

424: Security Holes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/424:_Security_Holes,computers,True story: I had to try several times to upload this comic because my ssh key was blacklisted.,"The ""Debian-OpenSSL fiasco"" was a major security problem discovered in the Debian Linux distribution and its version of the cryptographic library called OpenSSL. With just a tiny change in the software, which was intended to have no effect on security, its random number generator was completely crippled, as was the security of all cryptographic keys generated by the system. The problem was created when a Debian developer removed one line of code which was crucial, even though it could seem like it did nothing useful. More detail about the fiasco: Crippling Crypto: The Debian OpenSSL Debacle, Debian's information page about the problem.  The title text refers also to this issue: After the security problem was found, all cryptographic keys generated or used on the broken operating system needed to be replaced. Many systems introduced special checks for such weak keys, adding the keys to blacklists, thereby preventing their use and forcing users to create new keys. Randall claims he was affected by that when uploading this comic to the server.  The comics on the left presents Cueball as a programmer who, on a whim, removes pieces of code (commenting out the code by prepending the line with two slashes), presumably thinking they are not necessary. The first removed line, MD_update(&m, buf, j); is the exact piece of code which was removed in the Debian fiasco. The next panels show him commenting out fictitious lines of code apparently preventing bad things from happening.  The other part of the comic lists ""security problems"" which were allegedly discovered in other Linux variants afterwards:  Cryptographic software in Fedora Core was allegedly not secure against toy decoder rings.   Xandros (used in Asus Eee PC netbooks) gave superuser privileges to anybody ""if asked in a stern voice"". This is likely a reference to fact that the preinstalled Xandros OS did not require a password for root privileges by default.  Gentoo would succumb to flattery, which may be a reference to Gentoo's notorious difficulty to manage. Any user who is capable of understanding it, might have a large ego, and therefore be susceptible to flattery.  OLPC OS could have been attacked using Jeff Goldblum's laptop computer, which refers to a scene in the Independence Day movie, where Jeff Goldblum's character was able to hack into an alien spaceship using his Apple PowerBook computer - which is a topic of great contempt by geeks who point to the absurdity of such a construction.  Slackware gave superuser privileges to anybody who ""says Elvish word for 'friend'"", which refers to a scene in The Lord of the Rings, where the entrance door to Moria could have been opened using a password mellon, the Elvish word for ""friend"", as indicated on the door itself.  And Ubuntu, which is another Linux distribution, was allegedly found to be actually Windows Vista, the latest version of Microsoft Windows at this time in 2008. This may be a reference to Ubuntu being developed with non-advanced users in mind, with many fail-safes and additional features being turned on by default, which had more in common with Windows than any other Linux-based operating system at the time.","[Cueball sitting at computer.] Cueball: I'll just comment out these lines...  // MD_update(&m, buf, j);  // do_not_crash();  // prevent_911();  In the rush to clean up the debian-openssl fiasco, a number of other major security holes have been uncovered:    Affected system   Security problem   Fedora Core   Vulnerable to certain decoder rings   Xandros (EEE PC)   Gives root access if asked in a stern voice   Gentoo   Vulnerable to flattery   OLPC OS   Vulnerable to Jeff Goldblum's Powerbook   Slackware   Gives root access if user says Elvish word for ""friend""   Ubuntu   Turns out distro is actually just Windows Vista with a few custom Themes"
463: Voting Machines,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/463:_Voting_Machines,computers,"And that's *another* crypto conference I've been kicked out of. C'mon, it's a great analogy!","In the 2008 Ohio primary elections, there were numerous problems with electronic voting machines, which eventually required many districts to revert to pen and paper. Premier Election Solutions, the company that handled the machines, blamed these problems on McAfee anti-virus software.  It is not uncommon to see computer software contract stipulating that the vendor will warrant that software and systems delivered will not contain any viruses or malicious code — a knee-jerk reaction to this is for novice management to include virus-scanning software for systems which otherwise are closed. From a computer programming standpoint, having anti-virus software on an electronic voting machine doesn't make sense because the machine shouldn't be accessing the Internet in a way that would leave it open to virus attacks. While there are a lot of ways that viruses can propagate, ultimately the computer still has to download an executable file and run it, which is something that no election machine should do in normal operation. Hence the question is whether the voting machine manufacturer has taken the proper precaution preventing any external access.   Ideally, voting machines (as well as ATMs and other single-purpose appliances) should be embedded systems, incapable of doing the things that might necessitate anti-virus software. However, in practice such devices are more commonly built as application programs running on ordinary Windows PCs (inside of custom-shaped cases), and they download software updates over the internet.  The comic makes an analogy to a teacher who reassures you that he always wears a condom when teaching. While a condom could be considered ""protection"", and therefore a good thing, common sense dictates that teachers should never end up in a situation where wearing a condom in school would be useful; this parallels the idea that while security in the form of anti-virus software on voting machines could also be considered protection and a good thing, it should never be required. The comment is more likely to make people worried about why the condom is there and what purpose it's serving. Similarly, informed people might worry why a voting machine is connecting to the internet.  In panel one, both the facepalm and ""You're doing it wrong"" are Internet memes, used to mock someone who made a foolish mistake.  The title text refers to 153: Cryptography.","Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold) has blamed Ohio voting machine errors on problems with the machines' McAfee antivirus software.  [Cueball is sitting at a computer, facepalming.] Cueball: Wait. ""Antivirus software""? On voting machines? You're doing it wrong.  [Cueball's friend enters the frame and speaks to Cueball.] Friend: Why? Security is good, right? Cueball: Of course. But, well—  Cueball: Imagine you're at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching.  Friend: Ah. Strictly speaking, it's better than the alternative— Cueball: —Yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong."
466: Moving,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/466:_Moving,computers,We need a special holiday to honor the countless kind souls with unsecured networks named 'linksys'.,"The caption notes that few forces are more powerful than a geek trying to get Internet in a new apartment. Thus explaining the title of the comic: Moving.  A cantenna is a do-it-yourself antenna made from a can, in this case a pringles can. Cueball is pointing his cantenna to the neighbors across the road, which, as he says, will allow him to connect to the wifi network there.  Megan points out that the neighbors themselves don't have internet access, to which Cueball answers that he thinks that the neighbors will get hooked up to the internet first.  The title text continues this theme of connecting to other people's networks, noting that we should have a holiday in honour of those people who don't bother reconfiguring their Linksys routers (thus leaving them with the default name of 'linksys'; this was very common when this comic was published in 2008), which allows other people to connect to those networks very easily, as they aren't encrypted by default and don't need a password.","[Caption above the panel:] There are few forces more powerful than geeks desperately trying to get internet in a new apartment.

518: Flow Charts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/518:_Flow_Charts,computers,"At 8 drinks, you switch the torrent from FreeBSD to Microsoft Bob. C'mon, it'll be fun!","Flowcharts are diagrams that represent processes in a graphical form. While predominantly used in computer programming to visualize the structure of source code, flowcharts can in theory be used to depict any real or virtual procedure. In this comic, this idea is subverted by employing a flowchart to explain how flowcharts work. Flowcharts are a recurring theme on xkcd, and a list of flowchart comics can be found here.  This seems like a faulty basis for explaining anything, but the basic functionality of flowcharts is quite intuitive, and the attempted self-description is almost unnecessary. In fact, the comic does not actually explain how to use the flowchart: it just uses an example of a very simple flowchart to demonstrate to the reader that they can easily work out how to follow it.  If the reader attempts to ""game"" the system by either giving contradictory answers, or refusing to acknowledge that they can see the ""Yes"" and ""No"" labels, the flowchart gets confused or becomes abusive.  Just like a real computer.  If you confirm or demonstrate that you can follow the flowchart, it inevitably leads to the ""Let's go drink"" box, which gives rise to the assumption that the whole chart was only a pretence for drinking.  FreeBSD is a unixoid operating system for computers which is generally considered to require advanced skills. The question whether Linux or (Free)BSD is the preferable operating system is a question of almost religious belief to some. The comic takes a shot against FreeBSD by implying that one would only decide to install it when under the influence of alcohol. This may also be a reference to 349: Success.  The title text mentions Microsoft Bob, a software package published in 1995 by Microsoft. The product was targeted towards beginners, and Microsoft decided to use a cartoon-style interface instead of a more 'professional' environment. It was a commercial failure, and still serves as an inside joke among IT professionals.  Randall has made use of flowcharts before and later he released another comic name 1195: Flowchart.","[A flow chart is shown beneath a caption. There are 14 boxes five diamond shaped and the rest rectangular. From all the diamond boxes there are one arrow entering and two arrows leaving (with yes/no labels on them). One of the other boxes is the start with only one arrow leaving, and three of these boxes are endings with only one arrow entering. Three has two arrows entering and one leaving. And two have one in and one out. Caption:] A guide to  understanding flow charts presented in flow chart form.  Box 0: Start [Arrow to Box 1.]  Box 1: Do you understand flow charts?

528: Windows 7,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/528:_Windows_7,computers,Disclaimer: I have not actually tried the beta yet. I hear it's quite pleasant and hardly Hitler-y at all.,"Megan is observing Cueball use a laptop on which he has installed the Windows 7 beta. However, the alleged Windows 7 beta is showing nothing but a picture of Adolf Hitler and Cueball is unable to do anything. Cueball then presses Control-Alt-Delete (the well-known Windows Secure Attention Sequence which opens Task Manager or displays a list of options which includes 'Shut Down' and 'Restart') as suggested by Megan, but only manages to make the picture's eyes flash.  The fourth panel shows Megan commenting that this Windows 7 beta is better than Windows Vista, to which Cueball agrees. The joke is that Megan deems a mostly non-functional and vaguely sinister OS better than Windows Vista, which had problems that were mocked in Apple Mac OS TV commercials.  The title text is a disclaimer stating that Randall has not tried the beta at the time this comic was written, but what he has heard about it he regards as at least mildly positive. However, he also damns it by faint praise, referring to it as hardly Hitler-y at all, a statement that could raise warning flags, as one would not generally expect an operating system to be able to be described as Hitler-y to any degree at all. ""Hitler-y"" is implied to mean pertaining to or having qualities similar to Adolf Hitler, the late German Nazi Party leader.","[Megan is standing behind Cueball sitting at a desk using his laptop.] Megan: What are you doing? Cueball: Trying the Windows 7 beta. Megan: Why is it showing a picture of Hitler? [The laptop's screen is shown with Adolf Hitler's face on it.] Cueball: I don't know. I can't get it to do anything else. Megan: There's no UI? Cueball: No, just Hitler. [Return to the original scene, except Megan is now scratching her head in confusion.] Megan: Did you try Ctrl-Alt-Delete? Cueball: It just makes Hitler's eyes flash. Megan: Huh. [Scene remains basically the same, except Megan is no longer scratching her head and Cueball is no longer typing on the laptop.] Megan: Well, it's better than Vista. Cueball: True."
530: I'm An Idiot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/530:_I%27m_An_Idiot,computers,"Sadly, this is a true story. At least I learned about the OS X 'say' command.","Cueball, locked out of his dorm/apartment, is trying to get his roommate Megan's attention so that she'll unlock the door. He tries various increasingly obscure ways of contacting her: calling her cell phone, IRC, the window, and finally remotely logging into their downstairs Mac computer (via SSH) to make it shout at her, which involves working out a way to turn up the computer's volume. Ponytail informs him of the most obvious solution—the doorbell—which prompts a moment of realization.  The content of this realization—""I'm An Idiot""—is stated in the title of the comic.  The humor of the comic derives from the rhythm of the panels: a long buildup followed by a short quip, then a sudden, silent pause for the implied realization moment.  The humor of this comic also derives from the reader's familiarity with the behavior shown in the comic, since most every person who likes solving problems has experienced a moment of realization similar to Cueball's at one point or another.  They, like Cueball, get distracted by solving an interesting problem because solving problems is fun, and fail to notice that the problem has an easier solution that they haven't considered.  This same issue of getting lost in a sub-problem [in this case, the-sub problem of how to remotely control text-to-speech in OS X] at the expense of overall problem-solving ability is further covered in 761: DFS.  The title text states that this is a true story, so Cueball must represent Randall. It also mentions that, although missing an obvious solution can be humiliating, one often learns a lot from trying new solutions, which would explain why the behavior persists.  This comic follows a similar storyline to 349: Success and 1518: Typical Morning Routine, as Cueball and Hairy respectively in these comics, encounters an issue and attempts proceedingly more absurd solutions to the issue.","[Ponytail approaches Cueball, who is sitting on porch steps, laptop in lap and backpack open.] Ponytail: Should I ask? Cueball: I'm locked out, and I'm trying to get my roommate to let me in.  [Unplugged cell phone on table.] Cueball: First I tried her cell phone, but it's off.  [Cueball sitting on steps, laptop in lap and gesturing.] Cueball: Then I tried IRC, but she's not online.  [Cueball standing in front of house and looking up at window.] Cueball: I couldn't find anything to throw at her window,  [Living room with couch easy chair and computer set up.] Cueball: So I SSH'd into the Mac Mini in the living room and got the speech synth to yell at her for me. Computer: Hey I'm locked out downstairs  [Megan sitting at table with laptop open.] Cueball: But I think I left the volume way down, so I'm reading the OS X docs to learn to set the volume via command line.  [Ponytail facing Cueball, who is still sitting on the porch with his laptop.] Ponytail: Ah. Ponytail: I take it the doorbell doesn't work?  [Beat panel.]"
533: Laptop Hell,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/533:_Laptop_Hell,computers,"The xkcd.com sysadmin has a Q2010, and I can attest that it can handle a fall down several flights of concrete steps. Relatedly, he's upset with me - I hope he doesn't take revenge by messing with my site's contenDISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS","The Devil Mephistopheles (named so in the official transcript) is greeting the new souls sentenced to Hell, and recognizes an executive from Fujitsu Ltd in the form of Hairbun. Mephistopheles accuses her of causing his favorite laptop, the Fujitsu Q2010, to be taken out of production. Mephistopheles is displeased because he thought it was a good laptop, just poorly marketed by Hairbun. Hairbun is confused and asks Mephistopheles why he is upset, as acts of evil are generally encouraged by the demons of Hell. Mephistopheles agrees but explains that Hell also needs good laptops, and in her case their need for laptops was greater than the need for her evil works. Though, Mephistopheles then goes on to confess, that it would not really have mattered as Hell has an exclusive deal with Fujitsu competitor, Sony, and he could not have bought the Fujitsu Q2010 anyway.   This would explain why the sale of the laptop failed, and Hairbun also exclaims I knew it to indicate that she had suspected it was weird that Sony did so well. When you strike a deal with a devil from Hell your affairs in life goes great, but of course you have then sold your soul to eternal damnation in Hell when you eventually die. Seems like Sony has done so according to this comic.  This comic is likely a wish fulfillment fantasy by Randall for the canceling of his favorite laptop, the Fujitsu Q2010. Exclusivity deals are typically thought ill of as they are bad for competition. Also since exclusivity deals solely benefit the provider, there are often reciprocal arrangement for the purchaser. This implies that the devil has influence at Sony. Likely Sony was chosen as the electronic distributor to hell because of the Sony rootkit scandal. This scandal inspired many to call Sony an evil company.  It is the second time in a short while that a demon was depicted in a similar fashion although without the trident and not in Hell. This devil was also named Mephistopheles in the caption of that comic 501: Faust 2.0.  The title text explains that Randall's systems administrator is upset with him because he tested the systems administrators laptop by throwing it down several flights of steps. The systems admin is implied to have taken revenge childishly, by replacing part of the text with ""DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS"" although it is almost certainly done by Randall as a joke.  The ""suck cocks"" part is a reference to a post in bash.org which went on to attain moderate fame.","[A devil, Mephistopheles (according to the official transcript), with bald head horns, tail with arrow ending, a trident in one hand and a paper in the other hand is ready to welcome Hairbun to hell. Above Mephistopheles there are three large stalactite hanging down and behind Hairbun there is one very large stalagmite and three small and also two small stalactites.] Mephistopheles: Welcome to Hell. Here's—  Mephistopheles:Wait. I know you.  [Zoom in on the two, with white background. Mephistopheles trident breaks the panels frame.] Mephistopheles: You're the Fujitsu exec who killed the Q-series. Hairbun: ...Yes? Mephistopheles: The Q2010 was the perfect laptop!  [In this frame-less panel with white background Mephistopheles walks away from Hairbun trident pointing up and left. Hairbun throws her arms out to the side.] Mephistopheles: Powerful, durable, had every feature, and made the Air look bulky. And that was back in 2006! Hairbun: But no one bought it! Mephistopheles: Then you marketed it wrong!  [Mephistopheles turns around towards Hairbun who both standing as in the first panel but still with white background.] Hairbun: Wait. Don't you encourage evil acts down here? Mephistopheles: In theory, yes, but we need laptops too!  Mephistopheles: Although it's moot, since we have an exclusive deal with Sony. Hairbun: I knew it!"
597: Addiction,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/597:_Addiction,computers,"But if you unplug everything, it gets so quiet you hear that high-pitched empty-room hum. And then the whispers begin.","Megan is attempting to stay a weekend at home without the Internet as she feels the constant exposure to novelty (from her internet surfing) saps her own initiative. She writes a ""last"" on-line message about her resolution to Cueball, but he writes back that he doubts she can do it for even one hour.   She turns off her computer (or at least the screen) and stands up triumphantly next to it, however then she logs right back on to write to Cueball that it's not half bad being off-line, thus violating her original attempt as she clearly used a computer to send the message to Cueball. She doesn't even realize she did this until Cueball replies with the written sound Ahem? proving he was right about less than one hour.   Very typical of people having some kind of addiction, in this case for being on-line, they may not even realize when they indulge into it, which is the case with Megan here.  The title text elaborates on Megan's addiction, saying that when she turns off all of the machines in the room, it results in an ""empty-room hum"". This is a high pitched buzzing noise, which it is suggested results from the brain increasing its sensitivity to noises. This is a fairly normal experience, but the ""whispers"" mentioned may be slightly more sinister, as this is frequently associated as a sign of schizophrenia. See also 1590: The Source.","[Close up of Cueball typing at his computer. Megan's text message to him can be seen coming from the screen with a zigzag line, and Cueball writes a response as seen from the line going from his hand on the keyboard up to his message.] Megan (through the computer): Constant novelty saps my initiative. I'm gonna try to spend a weekend at home without internet. Cueball (writing): I give you an hour.

601: Game Theory,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/601:_Game_Theory,computers,"Wait, no, that one also loses. How about a nice game of chess?","The comic and title text is a direct reference to the movie WarGames.   In the movie, the Artificial intelligence (AI) that controls the US Nuclear Weapons is asked to play Global Thermonuclear War, a real time game simulating a nuclear attack scenario.   Spoilers: In the movie it then takes the simulation to the real world, planning to launch a real attack on the USSR. In the end the AI is tricked into quickly running through several scenarios of the game, and then shuts down its planned attack as a result of what it finds out.   After analyzing all possible strategies, the AI reports: ""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?"" Interpreted literally, this means that the computer has figured out that it will lose the game no matter how it plays, so it chooses to play chess instead (at the time of the movie, computers could not yet beat the best human chess players, so it would be more interesting). A more profound interpretation is that wars always end badly for all parties involved so it's better to play nicer games like chess.  In this comic Cueball loads an AI and then ask it to ""analyze love"" (equivalent to playing the ""love game""), which initially could be expected to end happily for everyone involved, as love is the opposite of war and war ends always so badly. Surprisingly, the result from the AI is similar to the war games. Thus if you ""play the love game"", you'll end up badly, regardless which moves you play.   The title text leaves love as looking actually worse than war, since in war there's at least the ""winning move"" of not playing, however in love even refusing to play means that the player loses the game anyway. Randall is thus stating that you have to go after love, even though you know you will loose/get hurt sometimes, because you will for sure also loose the game, even if you pretend not to play. The AI then again suggest a game of chess, as in the movie.",[Cueball is sitting at a desk in an office chair typing on his computer. The text appearing above him is implied to be what is displayed on the screen.] A.I. Loaded >>> Analyze love  [An hourglass appears over the computer as Cueball sits back and wait.]  [The hourglass continues to display as Cueball shifts in his chair.]  [A zigzag line from the computer indicates the final reply from the computer to the query.] Computer: A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
607: 2038,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/607:_2038,computers,"If only we'd chosen 1944-12-02 08:45:52 as the Unix epoch, we could've combined two doomsday scenarios into one and added a really boring scene to that Roland Emmerich movie.","The 2038 problem is a well-known problem with 32-bit Unix-based operating systems. Unix time is stored as a 32-bit signed integer on these systems, counting the number of seconds since 1970. In 2038, we overflow the highest number we can store in 32-bit integers, leading to unexpected behavior. The switch to 64-bit operating systems will most likely be complete by the year 2038, which is why Randall is relieved. The reference to Y2K is a throwback to the year 2000 problem, in which people were concerned that computers storing digits as two numbers (e.g.: 99 to represent 1999) would cause problems when the year 2000 began because 00 could have been interpreted as 1900 by error. That Y2K issue was covered widely — with only some small mishaps — but calculating dates beyond 2038 is still not solved on many 32-bit UNIX based systems today. The ""even WORSE"" is a play on the fact that even being ""even worse"" than the actual results of Y2K doesn't necessarily mean it will be particularly bad, Y2K resulting in very few serious problems, especially in light of the hype that preceded it.  The title text is a reference to the film ""2012"" which is about the world ending in December of 2012, at the end of the Mayan calendar. If the designers of the UNIX operating system had used 1944 as their epoch instead of 1970, then the UNIX crash due to a variable overflow would coincide with the end of the Mayan calendar. Thus, the implication is that there could have been a boring scene in the movie where the UNIX time rolls over and nothing happens and no one cares — because the world doesn't exist any more.","I'm glad we're switching to 64-bit, because I wasn't looking forward to convincing people to care about the Unix 2038 problem. Friend: What's that? Cueball (arms raised high): Remember Y2K? This could be even worse!"

A common joke with the site is how you will read a page, find a certain trope, which will open another tab on your web page. Then, as you read another article, you'll open even more pages. Pretty soon, this will cause an extremely long cycle of opening new pages and closing old ones.  In the comic, this is exactly what happens to our unfortunate victim. He starts on a single page, then opens more and more tabs on different pages. Pretty soon, he finds himself stuck in a loop of opening pages.  The last frame refers to Rickrolling, which is the practice of being linked to Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" on YouTube.  The title text refers to the comedy site Cracked.com. This site is also known for its addictive articles. Most articles are formatted in the same way the title text notes. Eventually, Cracked itself wrote a column that paid tribute to this cartoon.

612: Estimation,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/612:_Estimation,computers,"They could say ""the connection is probably lost,"" but it's more fun to do naive time-averaging to give you hope that if you wait around for 1,163 hours, it will finally finish.","When moving or copying files using the Windows Explorer, a dialog box opens to inform the user of how many of the files being moved have been moved with an estimate of how long the rest of the files should take. However, this estimate is often subject to seemingly random and extreme changes from a time measured in seconds or minutes to one measured in hours or days. This is because Windows bases its estimate on the latest file transfer rate, which exaggerates short-term fluctuations. For instance, transfers of many small files are generally slower than transfers of a few large files, because of per-file overhead (time spent writing data describing the file's title, location, etc. to the disk). A brief slowdown may cause the system to display that the transfer will take a long time (based on the total amount of data yet be transferred and the current low speed), while a sudden burst of data moved quickly between memory caches will give a time that is much too small.  A better implementation would keep track of the average file transfer rate over the entire operation, which would even out the bumps and give a more accurate estimate. Windows 8 avoids the problem by doing away with the time estimate.  The joke in the comic is the idea that this feature was actually purposely implemented and that the person who did so actually talks like that. He tells some friends on the phone how long it will take for him to arrive at their meeting point. However, like with Windows's estimation feature, he quickly changes his estimate multiple times from the extremes of days to seconds due to small fluctuations in traffic flow (like when he has to stop on a red light and then he speeds up on green).  The title text refers to the fact that if the connection is lost, and data can no longer be transmitted, the estimation just gets larger and larger as time goes on rather than realizing that no data being sent means there is no connection. A behavior that occurs on Microsoft network connections even when the connection is not lost. Kubuntu avoids this problem, but not that of wide fluctuations, by including only the past few seconds in its estimate. If there has been zero progress within the averaging interval, it reports ""Stalled"".","Cueball: I'm just outside town, so I should be there in fifteen minutes.

Linux is notorious for its less-than-perfect support for hardware, although support for most hardware is eventually patched into the official kernel release. Cueball is here under the impression that support for a USB port can be patched into his arm in a similar fashion to how hardware support can be added to the Linux kernel.  The ""Vista-Ready"" sticker in the title text is a humorous indication from the doctor that the patient is ""advanced enough"" to have Windows Vista installed. The irony is multilayered. There was a lawsuit against Microsoft about promoting not-so-capable computers as ""Windows Vista Capable""; they could neither run Vista fully nor smoothly. On top of that, the typical Linux user would not be very enthusiastic about Windows at all; someone who runs Linux has actively chosen an alternative operating system.","[A surgeon is standing over a patient on a gurney.] Patient: While you're doing the surgery, can you also implant this in my arm?

Cueball points out that they could've stayed home and used Photoshop to alter pictures they've already taken, saving themselves the trouble of going on the trip. The hue control in such image editing programs shifts the colors around the spectrum without altering the brightness; the green leaves in a summer picture could then easily be shifted to yellow or red.   Megan simply shushes him in the strip, but the title text is implied to be Megan's retort, saying that Cueball used to be a happier person, and if he will continue being like this, she would prefer to see him in old pictures rather than living with him. Or it could be that Cueball is making a response to the shush as he seems to be the more technologically inclined and more annoyed.  The comic is also showing how, because of technology, many people are not as ""happy"" as they once were. Instead of appreciating natural beauty, Cueball simply wishes to ""replicate"" the experience by using Photoshop; unfortunately, this would deprive him of both the experience of beautiful fall leaves and a shared intimacy with Megan.

According to the title text, Cueball and Susie (who is drawn as a sexy version of Megan) do end up hooking up, even against Cueball's better judgement, as so often happens between people who're physically attracted to one another. And he apparently left the webcam on as well, because the Facebook feature is now giving suggestions on what Cueball should do to her, mid-coitus.","[Cueball is sitting at his computer.

676: Abstraction,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/676:_Abstraction,computers,"If I'm such a god, why isn't Maru *my* cat?","The comics points out the large number of levels of abstraction working together at any given time in today's computers.  Programs on current computers do not run ""directly on hardware"". Instead, the hardware (in this case, a processor of the x86-64 architecture) is controlled by the operating system kernel (in this specific case, XNU is the kernel used in Apple-branded devices). Many operating systems offer a standardized interface called POSIX, which wraps the services offered by the different operating systems so that applications do not need to cope with the differences between the operating systems. Darwin is the name of the core set of components on which the Apple's OS X operating system runs. And using this operating system, the user runs the Firefox web browser. However, the browser itself contains further abstraction layers: Gecko is the engine handling the display of web pages on the screen, but in this case, it only allows a separate software, Adobe Flash Player, to render a video requested by the user.  And all of this work is, in this case, done only because the user wanted to watch a funny cat Flash video on the Internet; which makes the user feel like he is a god.  The title text refers to Maru the cat, a cat who became very popular on YouTube for, among other things, jumping into a box. Cueball questions his god-like capabilities by wondering why can't he own Maru.  484: Flash Games offers another take on the highly abstracted layers of a computer, also referring to Flash.","[Cueball is sitting at a computer.] An x64 processor is screaming along at billions of cycles per second to run the XNU kernel, which is frantically working through all the POSIX-specified abstraction to create the Darwin system underlying OS X, which in  turn is straining itself to run Firefox and its Gecko renderer, which creates a Flash object which renders dozens of video frames every second  because I wanted to see a cat jump into a box and fall over.  I am a god."
686: Admin Mourning,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/686:_Admin_Mourning,computers,And every day it gets harder to fight the urge to su to the user and freak people out.,"The background images show the output from the ps command of Unix-like computer systems, which lists all running processes including all interactive users logged in to the server. If a user did not log out, their processes would continue to run until stopped by a reboot. If some specific user dies while logged in, the running sessions still appear in the ps output and be a reminder to other users. This comic depicts an administrator unwilling to reboot a machine that has still running processes from a deceased user named ""sam"".  When a session is closed its descendent processes sent the HUP (Hang-up) signal, which normally causes them to terminate. However, the popular utility screen enables a user to detach and reattach that output, thus surviving over sessions.  The final joke refers to the command line interface being called a shell, and to a particular type of shell called zshell (/bin/zsh in the final panel), making a pun with the expression ""Ghost in the Shell"", which is the title of a popular manga series, originally derived from the expression ""ghost in the machine"", used by philosopher Gilbert Ryle to describe Descartes' theory of mind-body dualism.  The phrase ""su to the user"" refers to the ability of a system administrator — i.e. the superuser, a/k/a root — to switch to another user account (using the su command, which stands for substitute user) without needing the target user's password, as would normally be necessary, which in this case would give the impression that sam's ghost were using the account.","[The text is over a white-on-black terminal showing a bit of output from ps -el, with processes running from root and sam.] When a user dies, their connections time out, but their screen sessions linger.  [The end of the command line is a |grep sam.] The server's uptime grows because you can't bring yourself to reboot  and wipe out their last earthly presence  [The processes listed are screen, zsh, irssi, and grep sam.] the ghost in zshell."
722: Computer Problems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/722:_Computer_Problems,computers,This is how I explain computer problems to my cat. My cat usually seems happier than me.,"Cueball explains to Megan that he is having computer problems. Normally, he is able to manipulate a ""pattern"" on his ""metal rectangle full of little lights"" (a reasonable, if oversimplified description of generated images displayed on a monitor). Today, however, the ""pattern"" is ""all wrong"". Megan suggests that he might be able to fix it by pressing more buttons, but following her advice doesn't seem to have the desired effect.  According to the title text, Randall uses a similar technique to explain his computer problems to his cat. Cats have the habit to walk over or lay on keyboards so they press a lot of buttons. This is however not to fix the ""pattern"" which they usually don't care about but rather to get the same attention the keyboard receives from the cat's owner. Often cats prefer to lay on a warm place — and a keyboard belonging to a notebook is designed to dispense some heat.  As evidenced by both past and future comics, Randall likes to make an effort to explain things for simple minds.  Speculatively, Randall may be commenting on the abstract nature of events that effect Cueball's happiness or well being. While the work Cueball does on the computer seems very important to him, the deconstructed version as discussed by Megan and Cueball make his resulting distress seem out of proportion. This interpretation is further supported by the title text in which Randall's cat, unaware of more abstract representations of activity on the computer, enjoys greater happiness overall.  The concept of using simple English to explain complicated problems was first used in 547: Simple and has been revisited in 1133: Up Goer Five, 1322: Winter, and 1436: Orb Hammer.","[Cueball and Megan are looking at his computer, on the desk.] Cueball: You know this metal rectangle full of little lights? Megan: Yeah.  Cueball: I spend most of my life pressing buttons to make the pattern of lights change however I want. Megan: Sounds good.  Cueball: But today, the pattern of lights is all wrong! Megan: Oh god! Try pressing more buttons! Cueball: IT'S NOT HELPING!"
726: Seat Selection,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/726:_Seat_Selection,computers,Don't click on the wing.,"Many airlines give passengers the opportunity to select a preferred seat when booking a flight. In this case, Megan appears to be checking in at a at self-check-in at the airport where she is given the opportunity to select her seat. Rather than selecting a seat on the diagram, Megan clicks on the pilot seat (which is of course not an actual option for  online seating reservations[citation needed]). In the last frame, we see that because she chose the pilot seat she is now actually sitting in the captains seat flying the plane while whooping. A worried looking pilot sits behind her at the back of the cockpit holding both hands in front of his mouth.  The title text says to not click on the wing. The implication is that if you did click on the wing you would similarly end up sitting outside on the wing. Even if you were able to hold on, this would put you above the Death Zone which is at 7 km (See the what if? Rising Steadily). Standard cruising altitude is 10 km.. It will be an unpleasant death as the air is so thin that you actually lose oxygen to the air (as explained in the mentioned what if?)  This kind of event could lead to situations as the one depicted in 1660: Captain Speaking.","[A seat selection diagram to book your seat on a plane is displayed on a gray background. It shows the front end of a plane to just behind the wings. The outline of the plane is in a darker gray color, while the seating section is light gray with black seats. The cockpit windows are shown as well as the entrance section in the front of the plane where two arrows point out of the two possible exits one on each side. The first class section with only four seats for each of the 3 rows are clearly separated from the rest of the seats. The six seats for each row is labeled with letters A to F and the rows are labeled for every third seat starting at 9 and ending after two numbers behind the wings at 27.

727: Trade Expert,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/727:_Trade_Expert,computers,"I mean, it's been almost twenty years. Now, it's possible you're simply embedding Windows directory paths in your URIs, but in that case you need more than just a short lecture.","Cueball as a news anchor has another Cueball-like character as guest in the studio, a doctor who is also a trade expert. However, Steven Berlee turns out to be a fraud. In reality he is a frustrated programmer willing to lie his way on to news show to share his message with any newscasters wiling to listen:  The slash character (/), also known as forward slash, is the correct way to separate distinct parts of a web address; for example in the address ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)"", a slash follows the ""org"" and the ""wiki"". However, some newscasters are unfamiliar with the distinction between the different types of slashes, thus confusing the normal slash with the backslash (\), the wrong character. They may also be somewhat overzealous by trying to specify forward- or backslash since just saying ""slash"" would be sufficient. Also as mentioned in the title text the backslash is used in addresses on a windows PC.  Steven Berlee claims that he suffers every time this mistake is made in a news program, explaining his reason for cheating his way on the air. Steven's name is most likely made up, as it seems to be taken from two or three of the inventors of the Internet:  Searching the internet lists no one called Steven Berlee, and the only references points back to this comic.  The title text refers to how in the Windows operating system, the backslash is actually used instead of the slash as a separator (in contrast to Unix-based systems, which use the forward slash). Thus, the path to any Windows file encoded in a URI (uniform resource identifier) would correctly contain the backslash character. However, placing such an URI into a web address to be shared on a news show would be completely useless, as they are only accessible inside of a local Windows domain (usually one's own computer) and no one would be able to access that file over the Internet.   In the title text Steven complains that after having had the modern version of the Internet for 20 years (since early 90s and this comic was released in 2010) they should have learned the difference by now. He also continues to claim that if they do not understand the difference between an internet url and Windows directory paths, and thus embedding these into their urls, then he cannot help them with just a short lecture while he con his way to time on the air.","[Cueball as a news anchor is sitting behind a desk with his hand on the desk, leaning towards his off-panel guest to the right.] Cueball: And for more on the summit, we turn to trade expert Dr. Steven Berlee.  Cueball: Steven?

I'm just a programmer who lies to get on news shows.  [Close-up on Steven Berlee.] Cueball (off-panel): What? Why? Steven Berlee: To share a message with newscasters.

763: Workaround,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/763:_Workaround,computers,"I once worked on a friend's dad's computer. He had the hard drive divided into six partitions, C: through J:, with a 'Documents' directory tree on each one. Each new file appeared to be saved to a partition at random. I knew enough not to ask.","A relative of Cueball is depicted, who explains how he goes about sending a YouTube video to someone. The relative appears to be a stereotypical 'non-computer person', perhaps the father or grandfather of Cueball. The relative explains how he first saves a web page and opens it in Microsoft Word, then uses the 'Share' feature in Word to generate an email that contains the web page reformatted as a Word document, then sends that email to a service that extracts YouTube videos. Perhaps this service would then email back a link to some extracted file on some server, and this link could in turn be copied and pasted in another email, which could finally be sent to the intended recipient. It's all very complicated.  The premise is that non-computer-literate people will find a clumsy, highly elaborate way of achieving some task on a computer. They will do this by stringing together the functions they stumble upon in the few software packages they have limited familiarity with, rather than taking a more sensible, straightforward route. In this case, a much faster and simpler route would be to copy the address of the YouTube video from the address bar in the browser, then paste the address in an email to the intended recipient.  The caption says that though Randall encourages his relatives to solve their computer problems on their own, by trial and error, he has to resist the urge of asking them the method they used. That method is likely to be unnecessarily complicated. Perhaps this complexity, inefficiency or illogicality will cause Randall to be exasperated, or perhaps Randall feels it is unwise to tell them why their method is inefficient because of the possibility of humiliating or upsetting them, especially after they have spent a long time experimenting to find this suboptimal solution; it would be disrespectful to correct them. Or perhaps it would take too long to explain an alternative, even a much simpler one, because of the questions that it would lead to or because of the further misconceptions that would be exposed of which the relative should be disabused.  The title text just explains another example of a complicated and elaborate way of working that people who don't understand computers can create.","[A relative stands at a computer terminal. Cueball stands behind him with his head in his hands, double-facepalming.]  Relative: See, I've got a really good system: if I want to send a YouTube video to someone, I go to File → Save, then import the saved page into Word. Then I go to ""Share this Document"" and under ""recipient"" I put the email of this video extraction service...  I'll often encourage relatives to try to solve computer problems themselves by trial and error. However, I've learned an important lesson: if they say they've solved their problem, never ask how."
806: Tech Support,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/806:_Tech_Support,computers,I recently had someone ask me to go get a computer and turn it on so I could restart it. He refused to move further in the script until I said I had done that.,"Cueball runs into some problems with his network connection and contacts his Internet service provider's (ISP's) tech support for help. The customer service agent (represented by Hairy) is not very helpful, giving clearly pre-scripted advice that has nothing to do with Cueball's problem. Cueball gives up and asks to speak to an engineer, i.e. someone more knowledgeable about the technology and suggest to Hairy what to look for. Noticing a woman with black ponytail who has the stuffed Tux penguin on her desk and a poster of a bearded dude with swords (a reference to Richard Stallman particularly as he stands in 345: 1337: Part 5) he tells Cueball about her and Cueball recognizes the signs of a GNU/Linux geek and asks to talk to her. Hairy transfers him over to the engineer, who immediately recognizes the problem and fixes it. Then she tells him of a secret word (shibboleet - see below) which, if he speaks on the phone, will transfer him to a tech-savvy person able to help him, something installed already back in the 1990's by the geeks of that time. Cueball is elated but then at this point Cueball wakes up and unfortunately discovers the incident to be just a dream.  Poor customer and technical support is a common complaint of many ISPs.  Many ISPs outsource their support staff to foreign countries to reduce costs, and/or they delegate first-tier support to workers with little or no training.  Typically, these workers are given general scripts that prompt the customer to try common troubleshooting steps, such as restarting the computer, without any specific knowledge of the customer's complaint.  While these scripts may help resolve problems for the average customer, a representative using such a script is usually unprepared to assist someone who has a more advanced problem.  Furthermore, these scripts generally assume that the problem is on the customer's end and do not acknowledge problems that occur within the ISP, such as server or line problems.  Customers like Cueball often find it frustrating to deal with representatives reading from scripts.  As Randall mentions in the title text, this frustration is magnified when the representative refuses to move on to the next step until the customer has performed the previous one, whether or not it necessary or helpful.  In cases like this, it's often necessary to request an escalation to a higher ""tier"" of support, or to speak to a supervisor who presumably has more knowledge and/or influence, though even that can sometimes be a painful process. Thus, it is easy to see why Cueball would be elated to discover a way to automatically connect with the most helpful technical support representatives whenever he has a problem, and thus also why he get really disappointed when he realizes it was just a dream (dreams being a recurring theme in xkcd).  Cueball is running Haiku, an open source operating system which is still in a state of active development, having had no official release as of yet. While low-level tech support operators are given scripts which are predicated on the assumption that many computer problems are actually caused by the actions of clueless end users (as, in fact, they are), it's exceedingly unlikely most of these first-tier operators would have even heard of Haiku, not to mention that their scripts' assumptions would never apply to the sort of person who would be using an experimental OS as opposed to Windows, for instance.  ""Shibboleet"" is a portmanteau of ""shibboleth"" and ""leet"". A ""shibboleth"" means any word, custom, or other signifier which is used by members of a group to recognize other members or those who are ""in the know"" about something. Its use originates in the Hebrew Bible, where the precise pronunciation of this word was used to distinguish Gileadites from Ephramites. Leet (based on the word ""elite"") refers to ""leet-speak"", a practice of character substitution and abbreviation common across the Internet (or ""teh 1n73rn3t"", as you would say in leet). Thus, ""shibboleet"" is a shibboleth used to identify someone whose computer-knowledge is ""elite."" Leet is again in leet written as 1337 so again a reference back to the 1337 comic series including the comic mentioned above with Stallman.","[Cueball is on his cellphone, and holding up a small square piece of hardware with a foot in the other hand. Two wires go from the hardware down to the floor, where one is connected to a box on the floor with two black antennas, and then another wire goes out the other side of this, and bot this and the second wire from the hardware Cueball is holding goes under his desk, on top of which is his open laptop.] Cueball: ...restart my computer?

He has put the hardware down next to the box with antennas on the floor. Wires going off panel right toward the desk.] Cueball: I'm sorry, but this won't get fixed until I talk to an engineer. Can you look around for someone wearing cargo pants, maybe a subway map on their wall?  [Hairy is the tech support person on the other end sitting in an office chair at a desk. A phone is hooked up on his table with two wires coming out. He is wearing a headset. He leans back in the chair and looks behind him to the right. Cueball talks to him over the phone indicated with a zigzag line.] Hairy: There's a chick two phones over with a stuffed penguin doll and a poster of some bearded dude with swords. Cueball (on the phone): Perfect. Can you put her on? Hairy: Sure.  [The engineer, a woman with black hair in a ponytail, sits in an office chair at her desk typing on her lap top. She also has a headset. Behind her laptop sits a small penguin doll. Cueball talks to her over the phone indicated with zigzag lines.] Cueball (on the phone): Hey, so sorry to bother you, but my connection— Engineer: Yeah, I see it. Lingering problems from a server move. <type type> Engineer: Should be fixed now. Cueball (on the phone): Thank you so much.  [Zoom in on the engineers torso. The back of the chair and the top of her laptop just inside the panel.] Engineer: No problem. Hey, in the future, if you're on any tech support call, you can say the code word ""shibboleet"" at any point and you'll be automatically transferred to someone who knows a minimum of two programming languages.  [Zoom in on Cueball on the phone scratching his neck. The engineer talks to him over the phone indicated with zigzag lines.] Cueball: Seriously? Engineer (on the phone): Yup. It's a backdoor put in by the geeks who built these phone support systems back in the 1990's. Engineer (on the phone): Don't tell anyone.  [The last panel is split in two sections. In the top part still with a zoom in on Cueball, he takes the phone down to hang up. Only this section in inside a frame. The frame is normal at the top and half way down to the left, but only a small way down on the right side. The bottom part of the frame connects these two normal parts but with a wavy line to indicate that this is the end of a dream. In the frame-less part of the panel below Cueball is sitting up in his bed, having lifted his head fro the pillow behind him to the left. He lifts him self up with one hand while the other takes the sheet down over his body. The last part it thus drawn outside the rest of the framed part of the comic.] Cueball: Oh my god, this is the greatest—  Cueball: Wha— Cueball: ...Dammit."
858: Milk,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/858:_Milk,computers,It's not hard when you have the same thought like 40 or 50 percent of the time.,"Megan and Cueball are sitting quietly, engaged in their own solo pursuits.  Without any preamble, Megan answers a question that has not been asked, pointing out to Cueball that he would not be able to obtain milk from her breasts right now, as she is not lactating.  Cueball is flabbergasted that she seems to have read his mind, as this was exactly what he was wondering.  This comic is a comment on the fascination and sheer lack of knowledge that men have about women's bodies in general, and their breasts in particular.  Megan, like any other adult female mammal, is capable of producing milk from her mammary glands.  However, this facility is not always available; Megan would have to get pregnant and give birth to trigger the bodily changes that result in lactation. This is unless she can perform lactation without pregnancy. It is possible, but extremely hard.  In the third panel, Megan's legs are not seen, probably tucked under the armchair to feel more secure.  The title text indicates that this is not proof of Megan's psychic powers, as Cueball seems quite obsessed with this particular topic. Although if you interpret it as a response to Cueball's thoughts in the last panel it could remain ambiguous.","[Couple sitting opposed, Megan on couch reading book and Cueball a chair with a laptop.] Megan: The fact that I have breasts doesn't mean you could milk me now. I'd have to be lactating. [A beat passes.] Cueball (thinking): Oh my god she's psychic."
869: Server Attention Span,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/869:_Server_Attention_Span,computers,"They have to keep the adjacent rack units empty. Otherwise, half the entries in their /var/log/syslog are just 'SERVER BELOW TRYING TO START CONVERSATION *AGAIN*.' and 'WISH THEY'D STOP GIVING HIM SO MUCH COFFEE IT SPLATTERS EVERYWHERE.'","The comic shows - in human language - part of the conversations that a browser and web server do in order to get the right page. The protocol they use is called HTTP.  This comic makes fun of the issue that many web-servers that see a mobile browser will automatically suggest to load the mobile version of the website, but then serve the front page of the mobile site, not the page the user had requested. In quite a few sites, there is no 1-to-1 correspondence of pages between the regular and the mobile site, so this problem is difficult to solve and very annoying.  A second issue with HTTP is identified in the last panel. HTTP is a stateless protocol. After serving the web page, the connection is severed. Any new request for a page will have to start afresh - which is where the server starts with again: ""Hi! I'm a server!"" Of course, browsers do not have egos nor do they hold grudges but it can be annoying for users. This design issue can also slow down the browsing experience.  The title text is a joke that all the other servers in the rack think the web server is being childish. /var/log/syslog is where Linux and other posix systems store their system log messages. The 'trying to start conversation' comment is probably a joke on ARP discovery packets that are sent out to the network to see who is who. All servers send out ARP packets to see what other machines are on the network, but some machines send them out every 5 minutes, which can be extremely annoying for someone monitoring network traffic logs.  The coffee comment is another jab at web servers. Some websites use java, or other jvm based languages (Grails, Scala, etc.) as the back end of the website, as opposed to using PHP or ASP. Of course, java is another word for coffee, so a web server running on coffee is likely to be well-caffeinated, and well-caffeinated people tend to bounce off the walls with enthusiasm.","[Single server in a server rack.] Server: Hi!

894: Progeny,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/894:_Progeny,computers,"I tell my children 'it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.' I'm trying to take the edge off their competitive drive to ensure that I can always beat them.","This comic is a reference to IBM's computer Watson that beat humans at Jeopardy (see 1002: Game AIs). The IBM team created a computer that could formulate a response to a Jeopardy-style question. In case you are not familiar, Jeopardy is a game played where the contestants are given the answer to a question, and must devise the question. A question might be ""Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero; its second largest, for a World War II battle"", to which the contestant must answer ""What is Chicago?"". When going up against two Jeopardy champions, Watson was able to beat them both (by some margin, although he did answer the above-mentioned question incorrectly with ""Toronto"").  Megan chimes in that we are ""pretty awesome at teaching"" which is very true. Humans are the best (on this planet) at teaching other things to do a set of tasks. We train dogs, cats, lizards, birds, other people, and now we are getting quite good at teaching a computer, a simple machine completely of our own design, to mimic our own thought patterns and make decisions similar to what we would make. (See also 1263: Reassuring).  The title text makes fun of teaching our children values about not trying to win by any means (i.e. but while playing fair) by suggesting we are just trying to hold on to our ability to beat them in something.","[Cueball sits at a computer; Megan stands behind him.] Cueball: Wow — researchers taught a computer to beat the world's best humans at yet another task.

932: CIA,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/932:_CIA,computers,"It was their main recruiting poster, hung nearly ten feet up a wall! This means the hackers have LADDER technology! Are we headed for a future where everyone has to pay $50 for one of those locked plexiglass poster covers? More after the break...","Blondie as a news anchor is reporting on a hacker attack on CIA (hence the title)  This comic is a reference to the attacks by a group briefly known as LulzSec, which was a splinter group from the internet community known as Anonymous, also featured in 834: Wikileaks. In the back of the news report in frame one is the logo that was used by LulzSec. The group was able to publicize several high profile attacks. They were able to briefly take down the CIA website using a DDoS attack. DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service in which the attacker uses many computers to send traffic to a host and render it incapable of answering requests from any other computer, effectively taking the site down.  This comic is pointing out the difference between what lay-people (Ponytail) and the computer expert (Megan) hear when seeing a story like this. Most people may think there is no boundary between CIA website and its internal network, and conclude hackers compromised USA intelligence service most precious data, which would be an incredible display of incompetence by the CIA and would have some pretty obvious negative side effects for CIA assets around the world.  Computer experts, on the other hand, may compare the CIA website to a company's poster, so the damage done is much different and less harmful: the CIA's public relation capacities are hindered for a few hours. The damage from a DDoS is less catastrophic compromise of valuable federal databases, and more flash mob crowding in the lobby of the CIA offices and making life mildly inconvenient.  The title text is a transcript of a fake news report. A story similar to the attack is illustrated using old technology. This attempts to demonstrate how silly the news coverage of the real event is. The recruiting poster refers to the CIA website, as it is a PR tool with no connection to sensitive information. It being ten feet high refers to the fact that that the website is open to the public and has limited protections (as danger from a compromised site is low). The ladder technology refers to the DDoS attack, as these attacks are primitive, but possibly well coordinated. The plexiglass poster covers refer to website security tools that may be added to deter future vandalism.","[A television is showing Blondie as a news anchor.

934: Mac/PC,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/934:_Mac/PC,computers,It's fun to watch browsers fumblingly recapitulate the history of window management. Someday we'll have xmonad as a Firefox extension.,"This comic is a parody of the ""Get a Mac"" (also known as ""I'm a Mac"" or ""Mac vs. PC"") ad campaign for the Mac brand of computers. The ads personified the Mac and their competitors, the PC. The ads poked fun at the PC's terrible function while paying attention to the Mac's unique features. Each ad started with the duo introducing themselves as ""I'm a Mac..."" ""...and I'm a PC.""  The comic, however, presents the differences between them as no longer of much importance, since most everything nowadays is done through browsers due to the proliferation of cloud computing. In essence, using the same browser to visit the same website among different operating systems would give you an experience that is very much the same. Additionally, there is some self-referential humor here; both the Mac and PC are simple stick figures due to xkcd's style. Therefore, they are literally identical as far as appearance goes.  The title text refers to window management, which is software that controls windows on computers. xmonad is one such program, and Randall says that eventually it will be an extension usable with the browser Firefox. What makes it somewhat unusual (and thus worth mentioning) is that it is a tiling window manager, meaning it automatically arranges and resizes newly opened program windows to fit a grid.

936: Password Strength,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength,computers,"To anyone who understands information theory and security and is in an infuriating argument with someone who does not (possibly involving mixed case), I sincerely apologize.","This comic is saying that the password in the top frames ""Tr0ub4dor&3"" is easier for password cracking software to guess because it has less entropy than ""correcthorsebatterystaple"" and also more difficult for a human to remember, leading to insecure practices like writing the password down on a post-it attached to the monitor.  In simple cases the entropy of a password is calculated as a^b where a is the number of allowed symbols and b is its length. A dictionary word (however long) has an entropy of around 65000, i.e. 16 bits. A truly random string of length 11 (not like ""Tr0ub4dor&3"", but more like ""J4I/tyJ&Acy"") has 94^11 = 72.1 bits. However the comic shows that ""Tr0ub4dor&3"" has only 28 bits of entropy. Another way of selecting a password is to have 2048 ""symbols"" (common words) and select only 4 of those symbols. 2048^4 = 44 bits, much better than 28. Using such symbols was again visited in one of the tips in 1820: Security Advice.  It is absolutely true that people make passwords hard to remember because they think they are ""safer"", and it is certainly true that length, all other things being equal, tends to make for very strong passwords and this can confirmed by using rumkin.com's password strength checker. Even if the individual characters are all limited to [a-z], the exponent implied in ""we added another lowercase character, so multiply by 26 again"" tends to dominate the results.  In addition to being easier to remember, long strings of lowercase characters are also easier to type on smartphones and soft keyboards.  xkcd's password generation scheme requires the user to have a list of 2048 common words (log2(2048) = 11). For any attack we must assume that the attacker knows our password generation algorithm, but not the exact password. In this case the attacker knows the 2048 words, and knows that we selected 4 words, but not which words. The number of combinations of 4 words from this list of words is (211)4 = 244 bits. For comparison, the entropy offered by Diceware's 7776 word list is 13 bits per word. If the attacker doesn't know the algorithm used, and only knows that lowercase letters are selected, the ""common words"" password would take even longer to crack than depicted. 25 random lowercase characters would have 117 bits of entropy, vs 44 bits for the common words list.  Below there is a detailed example which shows how different rules of complexity work to generate a password with supposed 44 bits of entropy. The examples of expected passwords were generated in random.org.(*)  If n is the number of symbols and L is the length of the password, then L = 44 / log2(n).  The title text likely refers to the fact that this comic could cause people who understand information theory and agree with the message of the comic to get into an infuriating argument with people who do not — and disagree with the comic.  If you're confused, don't worry; you're in good company; even security ""experts"" don't understand the comic:  Sigh.","The comic illustrates the relative strength of passwords assuming basic knowledge of the system used to generate them. A set of boxes is used to indicate how many bits of entropy a section of the password provides. The comic is laid out with 6 panels arranged in a 3x2 grid. On each row, the first panel explains the breakdown of a password, the second panel shows how long it would take for a computer to guess, and the third panel provides an example scene showing someone trying to remember the password.

937: TornadoGuard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/937:_TornadoGuard,computers,The bug report was marked 'could not reproduce'.,"This is a comic with a take on an application store - the most common app stores are for iPhones and Android devices. App stores take all the reviews and average the ratings for the overall star rating.   In this comic, we see why this is sometimes a bad idea, especially with something as important as an app called TornadoGuard that should warn the user if a tornado is approaching. In this case, there are three 5 star reviews about the stability and user interface features of the app, left by users who actually never experienced its core functionality (simply because they never used it in a place where a tornado appeared since they got it); however, the only review related to whether the app really works is given the same weight as the others, and sadly for that user the TornadoGuard app failed in alerting the user to an upcoming tornado. Tornadoes are a recurring subject on xkcd. Also see future comic 1098: Star Ratings and 1754: Tornado Safety Tips.   The title text is a call back to 583: CNR. It is a note from the developer's bug report, which said they could not reproduce the error. Of course, they could only reproduce such a failure if there were a tornado coming towards their area. This is a fairly rare situation, especially in certain areas of the world. This lack of suitable testing conditions explains why the actual tornado-prediction portion of their code appears to be faulty.","[The comic is a single panel which resembles a reviews page for a mobile phone application.

948: AI,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/948:_AI,computers,And they both react poorly to showers.,"This comic is a reference to the wildly funny video of two Cleverbots talking to each other. By recording and analyzing whatever humans type into its input, they can sound pretty human to whoever is reading their response.  Megan has been watching the video and ask Cueball about it. He says it's just ""clumsy sampling"" as they are still very far from sounding like humans and holding normal conversations.   Megan then sums up that as of the release of this comic computers were good at chess and at driving cars through a desert (i.e. a place with no obstacles to hit. The ability of such self-driving cars would improve much later, with this comic being the first with a direct reference to such cars. Later self-driving cars became a recurring topic on xkcd). But they cannot hold a conversation for five minutes. And she thus concludes that a cleverbot would be perfect for attending Burning Man.  Burning Man is a week long event held yearly in Black Rock City, Nevada. The festival encourages an artistic, anti-establishment philosophy and attracts a broad but devoted following combining hippies, anarchists, nudists, techno-utopians and survivialists. Shows of custom cars on the desert plain is a big part of Burning Man, and mind games like chess are a popular way to pass the time there. However, a common joke about Burning Man attendees is that they can only talk about Burning Man - hence why they can't hold a five minute conversation.  A tradition of Burning Man is not to shower while you are there, mostly because all water must be brought in from offsite. And of course Cleverbot reacts badly in showers because if you do try to shower a Cleverbot, you end up with a shorted out computer.","[Megan sits on an office chair at a desk. A laptop computer is on the desk, audio from a Cleverbot chat is shown coming from the laptop with a zigzag line from the screen. Megan has turned her head away from the computer to the right addressing Cueball off-panel.] Megan: Did you see the Cleverbot-Cleverbot chat? Cleverbot (from computer): I am not a robot. I'm a unicorn.  [In the next frame-less panel, Megan has turned the chair away from the desk, which is not shown, and is now sitting with her hands in her lap in front of Cueball who holds one hand up as he replies.] Cueball: Yeah. It's hilarious, but it's just clumsily sampling a huge database of lines people have typed. Chatterbots still have a long way to go.  [A close-up of Megan's head and shoulders. She has a hand to her chin and appears to be contemplating the last remark. Cueball replies from off-panel.] Megan: So... Computers have mastered playing chess and driving cars across the desert, but can't hold five minutes of normal conversation? Cueball (off-panel): Pretty much.  [Both are shown again as in panel two, Cueball with his hands down.] Megan: Is it just me, or have we created a Burning Man attendee?"
949: File Transfer,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/949:_File_Transfer,computers,"Every time you email a file to yourself so you can pull it up on your friend's laptop, Tim Berners-Lee sheds a single tear.","Cueball is trying to help two people, his friend and his friend's cousin, exchange a 25 MB file. Most people know how to use email to send files through the internet, but 25 MB exceeds the attachment size limit of most email services. The reason there is a limit is because every email has to be transferred between several mail transfer agents, and each one has to temporarily store a copy of the email. Space constraints on those mail servers means that they must impose size limits, and an email with such a large attachment will therefore not be delivered.  The next option is to upload the file to an FTP server (FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, as opposed to HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol), used to transfer files between computers on a shared network, such as the internet. However, FTP servers are a touch more esoteric than a mere email attachment, and many internet users don't have access to one of their own.  Web hosting is simply the ability to create a website and store all the data for said website on a server which is connected to the internet. If Cueball's friend's cousin had the ability to do that, sharing the file would be as easy as putting a copy of it in an accessible directory and sending the link to the desired recipient.  Megaupload was one of many sites on the internet that recognizes most users' inability to host large files on their own, and so offers to host large files, sometimes for free, sometimes for a small fee. The payoff is that in order to make such a service profitable, many of these sites are cluttered with banner and pop up ads in a mad effort to squeeze as much ad revenue out of every page view as possible. It's not a dealbreaker for some, but Cueball seems to think it'll be too much for his friend's cousin to handle.  AIM direct connect was a file sharing system on AOL Instant Messenger, which was already suffering severe drops in popularity by the year 2000. Clearly, Cueball is grasping at straws here: anybody desperate enough to invoke the name of AOL as a solution instead of a problem must be at their wits' end.  Dropbox is a program with a web-based GUI that automates file sharing between two computers on the internet. But this solution also has its issues, as it requires that at least the sending party has a Dropbox account. Installing Dropbox software is not actually required, since Dropbox also provides a web interface for uploading and downloading files. At the time of the comic's publication, Dropbox was still relatively new and unknown, thus why it is not Cueball's first suggestion.  While Cueball is still explaining Dropbox, the friend's cousin has copied the file to a USB drive and physically transported it to the friend's house, circumventing the internet entirely. It's not an elegant solution, but sometimes traditional methods are the most efficient ways to get something done.  When used to transfer files between computers in the same room or building, this same approach is referred to as sneakernet. This comic is also an illustration of what Andy Tanenbaum said in 1989: Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway. Sneakernet was examined in this What If article.  Tim Berners-Lee is considered to be the inventor of the World Wide Web. In the title text, Randall implies that he would be disturbed by the need today to use two separate protocols (smtp for sending the file as an email attachment and http for retrieving the file from the mail server web interface) to perform a third, unrelated, obvious function such as file transfer.  Note that this is similar to the later 1810:_Chat_Systems.","[Cueball stands near a computer, talking on the phone to another person.]  Cueball: You want your cousin to send you a file? easy. He can email it to- ...Oh, it's 25 MB? Hmm... Cueball: Do either of you have an FTP server? No, right. Cueball: If you had web hosting, you could upload it... Cueball: Hm. We could try one of those MegaShareUpload sites, but they're flaky and full of delays and porn popups. Cueball: How about AIM Direct Connect? Anyone still use that? Cueball: Oh, wait, Dropbox! It's this recent startup from a few years back that syncs folders between computers. You just need to make an account, install the- Cueball: Oh, he just drove over to your house with a USB drive? Cueball: Uh, cool, that works too.  [Caption below the panel:] I like how we've had the internet for decades, yet ""sending files"" is something early adopters are still figuring out how to do."
958: Hotels,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/958:_Hotels,computers,"Rating: 1/5. Room filled to brim with semen, and when front desk clerk opened mouth to talk, bedbugs poured out.'","In this comic, Black Hat is putting bad reviews on all the hotels he has stayed at and likes and wants to stay in again, in order to lower demand for said hotel. He is simultaneously putting good reviews on bad hotels to steer other people there so there are more vacancies at good hotels. He claims he is not enough influence to put the good hotels out of business.  The Tragedy of the commons ""is a dilemma arising from the situation in which multiple individuals, acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen."" This situation is not a complete example of this concept as Black Hat is the only one doing it. He understands, however, that if others do it, it would apply. (Another example is what would happen using a certain strategy in the game Oregon Trail)  In the last frame, Black Hat references the invisible hand which is the term economists use to describe the self-regulating nature of the marketplace. Black Hat appears to be taking advantage of this invisible hand by cutting it with a knife and eating it.  The title text is an example of Black Hat's negative review, which in itself is a surrealist joke about the hotel. A very believable set of complaints about an awful hotel is that the ""Room filled to brim with bedbugs, and when front desk clerk opened mouth to talk, semen poured out"". However instead, the objects of focus are reversed, creating a ridiculous scenario for the reader to enjoy.","[Cueball is sitting at a desk with a laptop, looking at a review website] Cueball: What's with this negative review? You liked that hotel. Black Hat: I have a script that posts a bad review for every hotel I stay at. It reduces demand, which means more vacancies and lower prices next time.  Cueball: What if the place sucks? Black Hat: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.  Cueball: You punish companies you like! Black Hat: The odds of my review putting a hotel out of business are negligible. Cueball: If we all did that the system would collapse! Black Hat: Doesn't affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.  Cueball: That's not even the tragedy of the commons anymore. That's the tragedy of you're a dick. Black Hat: If you're quick with a knife, you'll find that the invisible hand is made of delicious invisible meat."
963: X11,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/963:_X11,computers,Thomas Jefferson thought that every law and every constitution should be torn down and rewritten from scratch every nineteen years--which means X is overdue.,"X11 is the X window system (commonly X Window System or X11, based on its current major version being 11). It is a computer software system and network protocol that provides a basis for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and rich input device capability for networked computers.  The X11 stacks are usually implemented using a display server. The reason that it is called a display server is that the actual viewer and the server do not need to be on the same system; X11 frequently runs over a network connection. This adds considerably to the complexity of the mechanism.  Most UNIX-based operating systems, including Linux and the BSDs use X11 as their base graphical subsystem and thus always use a display server and a display client. MacOSX has built-in support for X11, but does not use it for normal applications. For Windows, commercial and free solutions implementing an X11 display client exist.  Until 2004, for Linux the default display server was XFree86. This project required a variation of the config file that Randall mentions. It was forked into Xorg due to disagreements over the development model.  Xorg is nowadays the default display server: X.Org Server (commonly abbreviated to Xorg Server, XServer or just Xorg) refers to the X server release packages stewarded by the X.Org Foundation, which is hosted by freedesktop.org, and provides an interface to the standard X Window releases for the use of the free and open source software community.  Every aspect of XFree86 and Xorg can be modified in numerous ways, all the way down to tiny behaviors such as the default window size, window-border snapping, mouse button maps or how a touchpad is used. All of these settings can be found in the xorg.conf file, a massive file with hundreds upon thousands of individual settings that have accumulated over the lifetime of the Xorg project. The full documentation for xorg.conf contains all the settings contained within the file. When a problem arises in the graphical portion of a desktop using the X server, the solution may be to edit the xorg.conf file. The soul-crushing prospect of having to open and look up the correct parameter out of thousands that is causing issues is enough to destroy a person's satisfaction with their life.  Editing xorg.conf (especially manually) is much less necessary than it used to be.  In fact, some distributions do not even come with an xorg.conf file, because everything necessary can be auto-detected and/or configured elsewhere.  The Wayland project aims to replace some of X11 and not include any of the cruft that built up over the decades. It was started in 2008, way more than 19 years after the aforementioned config file turned into a hell.  The title text references a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison on the popular basis of political authority. There are a few quotes that can be pulled to sum up his ideas.  In his day most people lived only to age 55, so he supposes that a person reaches maturity at 21, and will live until 55 and then die. For the purposes of the other arguments he makes in the letter, he also supposes that all the people of a generation are born on the same day, and that they will all die on the same day: the day they turn 56.  Since only one generation is alive in his example, his model allows for that generation to do as they please for their time on earth, elsewhere in the letter he describes that each generation should not be able to leave the next generation in a worse position, so the debts accrued by one generation must be paid off by that generation. This has built us up to the quote that everyone attaches onto.  Because a generation reaches maturity at 21, and at that point the previous generation dies off, and this generation has 19 productive years until they are 40 and have 15 years of senility until their own death they have full reign of the earth as they please. Continuing on under the laws (and debts) of the previous generation is ""an act of force, and not of right"".  Jefferson picked 19 years because that was the length of time a generation spent in power, not that every 19 years all laws should be abolished, but that every generation, each new generation should tear down all the systems put in place, re-evaluate, and build better laws, systems, and constitutions.","[The comic is a graph with a curve starting at (0,0) that snakes toward the upper right of the graph.

How could you enjoy abusing a filesystem like that?","Cueball seems to have found a porn folder. However, it contains a directory loop, set up by a person off-screen. It is possible to actually do this, but it is widely regarded as a very bad idea, as it can break the system in not-so-obvious ways (mostly by causing seemingly-trivial operations to infinite loop). The implication is that the folder does not need to contain pornographic images because the folder is the porn—its violation of the taboo against looping is something the off-screen character finds erotic.  link() is the Linux system call to create a hard link. In an unmodified Linux kernel, it will not allow directory hard links for this exact reason; the person who set up the porn folder apparently ""forced"" Linux to comply, with all of the sexual analogies that suggests.","[Cueball sits at a desk, looking at a laptop screen with one hand on his chin.] Cueball: So I thought I found your porn folder, in calendar/backup/PORN Friend (off screen): Don't open that!

1000: 1000 Comics,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1000:_1000_Comics,computers,Thank you for making me feel less alone.,"This comic is the 1000th comic shown on xkcd containing 1000 characters from previous comics arranged in the shape of the number ""1000"". Megan is clearly excited as she screams ""Woooo!"", but Cueball, in true nerd fashion, thinks in base 2, saying that there are ""just 24 to go until a big round-number milestone"". The joke is that during programming, base two is used more often than base 10, making milestones be powers of two rather than powers of 10. Where 1000 is a round number in base 10 (103), 1024 is a round number in base 2 (210).  In the 1000 comic Randall included 404: Not Found, see why in the explanation for this comic. This comic strengthens the fact that Randall did indeed count 404 as a ""real"" comic.   Each of the characters/drawings can/will(?) eventually be numbered and described on this page:  There is a connect the dots puzzle hidden within the comic. However, rather than using the conventional decimal system numbering which would start with 1 and count up, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...  This connect the dots puzzle starts with 0 as a programmer would do and counts up in binary numerical order - 0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111,1000,1001 and back to 0. The revealed image forms the shape of a heart. This fits well with the title text where feeling less alone can equate to feeling loved.","[1000 characters, numerous of which have appeared previously in other comics, are arranged to create the number ""1000"".

1024: Error Code,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1024:_Error_Code,computers,"It has a section on motherboard beep codes that lists, for each beep pattern, a song that syncs up well with it.","Complex computer programs often incorporate a numbering system for errors that are anticipated might occur. This way, the code can be referenced to tech support so that there is some feedback from the program as to what is wrong (akin to a car dashboard with multiple lights telling you if you have a battery problem or an engine problem or a cooling problem, etc.) Most people have seen at least one error code in their life. Perhaps the most famous error code is seen in web browsers, 404 (not found). Another code is 403 (forbidden).  The guy at the computer gets the error ""-41"", but cannot tell even what program it comes from. So, the other guy decides to look up the code in a book apparently called Error Codes. The book then indicates to go to a lake instead of how to resolve the computer problem. Which seems like a great solution because it would be very relaxing! The panel with the image of the lake is fairly rare as far as xkcd comics go, in that it is approaching a photorealistic picture.   The beep codes referenced in the title text refers to the error codes produced by motherboards. Because the motherboard is sort of the ""heart"" of the computer, the designers apparently did not want to rely on any form of error display that might be compromised by the error itself (i.e. a visual display). Instead, motherboards typically have a code consisting of beeps from the system ""PC"" speaker which is expected to work without error in most situations, as it's wired directly to the motherboard. In a sort of morse-code-type system, certain lengths and numbers of beeps refer to different errors like memory problems, video card problems, etc. The one quick beep that occurs on boot sequences is the POST (Power On Self-Test) beep, which detects vital parts of the system, like motherboard, memory, monitor, etc. The beep indicates that everything necessary to boot is present. Anyone who has built a few computers is probably familiar with less happy beep sequences.  It is possible Randall wanted comic number 1024 to be about computers because 1024 is a significant number in computer systems: it is exactly 210, and as such is sometimes used instead of 1000 as the power constant for file sizes for the sake of easier binary arithmetic. This was referenced in 1000: 1000 Comics.","[A guy sits at a computer, while a friend takes a book off a shelf behind him.] Computer guy: ""Error -41""? That's helpful.

1052: Every Major's Terrible,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1052:_Every_Major%27s_Terrible,computers,Someday I'll be the first to get a Ph. D in 'Undeclared'.,"Randall has written a song called Every Major's Terrible and this comic illustrates the song. In this song the term Major refers to the US version of an academic major. And the point of the song is that it makes no sense to pick any major since they are all terrible!  The header notes that the song is written to the tune of the satirical Major-General's Song from Gilbert and Sullivan's 1879 comic opera The Pirates of Penzance. The song satirizes the idea of the ""modern"" educated British Army officer of the latter 19th century. Major general is a military rank in Britain and many other countries. (See here a YouTube video of "" I Am the Very Model of A Modern Major-General"" to get the tune). The meter in the Major-General's Song is iambic octameter, which means that in each line there are eight iambs, where an iamb is two syllables in an unstressed-stressed pattern. Therefore, each line contains 16 syllables.  The panels show Randall's rewritten lyrics to the song. Below each of the three verses are described in detail (go to Verse 1, Verse 2 or Verse 3). Each verse ends with ""Just put me down as 'Undecided' - Every Major's Terrible"", which gives the song its name — and ""Major's Terrible"" is similar enough to ""Major General"", the corresponding lyrics in the original version, to serve as a callback. The last line of the first verse in each song goes as follows:  The lyrics are commonly rewritten, the most famous rewrite likely being The Elements (song) by Tom Lehrer which is also mentioned below the main header. This song is also available on-line.   His last suggestion, ""Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious"", from Mary Poppins, is another fast-paced patter-song with a somewhat similar tune, though it doesn't fit quite so well, and the match falls apart at the end of the fourth line, when the ""Um-diddly""s start up — still, it's better than nothing.  There are at least two performances of this xkcd song online where the transcription is shown to make it easier to understand the text:  Regarding the title text: ""Undeclared"" is sometimes called ""General Studies"". Most U.S. universities will not let you get a degree in this, let alone an advanced degree such as a Ph.D. Also, it should probably be noted that this song refers to U.S.-like university systems, in other countries, one will study little to nothing outside your major, making it more-or-less impossible to be undecided as to major.","[Headings to the left and above the 36 panels:] Every Major's Terrible to the tune of Gilbert & Sullivan's Modern Major-General Song (Which you may know from Tom Lehrer's Elements.

First, the names are sorted up by genera (plural of genus, a low-level taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms) from bottom to top of which animals would win in a fight. Secondly, the names within the genus are then sorted by coolness of name from left to right (the degree of ""coolness"" of the name is apparently determined in subjective manner by the author). Thirdly, in red you can see the direction that Apple has taken with nicknaming the versions of their OS X operating system. They started at v10.0 ""Cheetah"", and have moved through genera from there in no order that this chart can make out.  Please note that the second words in ""Snow Leopard"" and ""Mountain Lion"" are capitalized in the table because they are used as the proper names of the operating system versions. In their normal use, as species vernacular names, they are not capitalized and are written as ""snow leopard"" and ""mountain lion"".  Bobcats are a running XKCD joke, so their inclusion is to be expected. The genus Puma here only lists synonyms for the puma (see cougar) instead of the actual genus. Of course, the three OS X versions named by three of these synonyms are not the same.  Since this comic was published, Apple has stopped naming versions of OS X after big cats. Now, Apple names their OSX versions after Californian landmarks. OSX v10.8 ""Mountain Lion"" was followed by v10.9 ""Mavericks"", named after a beach in California, followed by v10.10 ""Yosemite"", named after the California national park, v10.11 ""El Capitan"", named after the rock formation in Yosemite National Park, and v10.12 ""Sierra"", named after the Sierra Madre Mountains located in western California.  The title of the chart depicted on the comic (""OS X problem"") is perhaps an allusion to the travelling salesman problem, as the directed arrows and graph nodes might appear as a possible path of the salesperson between the cities. The computational difficulty of the travelling salesman problem might echo with the difficulties that the author has with trying to figure out the underlying reason for naming the OS X versions in particular order. The chart thus looks like a parody on the scientific presentation.  In the title text, a Smilodon fatalis is a saber-tooth cat, a Dracorex hogwartsia is a dinosaur that looks like a fairy tale dragon, and a Styginoloch spinifer is one of the last dinosaurs before the K-T (Cretaceous-Paleogene) extinction about 66 million years ago.

1083: Writing Styles,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1083:_Writing_Styles,computers,"I liked the idea, suggested by h00k on bash.org, of a Twitter bot that messages prominent politicians to tell them when they've unnecessarily used sms-speak abbreviations despite having plenty of characters left.","Sms-speak is a style of communication which involves substituting numbers for letters and shortening phrases to get a longer idea across in fewer characters at the cost of readability. The practice began first with text messages, also known as SMS, or Short Message Service, which limited messages to 160 characters. Twitter has adopted a 140 character limit since its inception, which allowed any given tweet to be received as an SMS message with enough room for the user's Twitter handle (15 characters max).  Randall is poking fun at both the stereotypical Senator and at teenagers supporting Ron Paul.  The dig at the senator refers to poor use of sms-style abbreviations by older, less tech-savvy politicians who are hoping to appear more in tune with the modern world. Many politicians use sms-speak in cases when their message isn't in danger of the character limit, but where they are appealing to a younger demographic, thinking it makes them appear to be ""modern"" to their target audience. In reality, it may do the opposite, showing that they do not understand why sms-speak is used at all.   Conversely modern teenagers, often stereotyped as lacking proper writing skills due to character limits on services such as SMS and twitter, instead here produce coherent sentences expressing a political view (this is later discussed in 1414: Writing Skills). There is a subtle dig that being drawn to  Ron Paul is a stereotypical political position for a teenager, as Paul is ideologically libertarian, and the implication is that libertarianism is a position held while younger and politically or economically naive. Randall has also poked fun at libertarianism on several other occasions, such as 610: Sheeple, 1026: Compare and Contrast, 1049: Bookshelf and 1277: Ayn Random. The teenager's tweet is almost identical to the stereotypical Paul-ite comment made fun of in the title text to 1026: ""Only Ron Paul offers a TRUE alternative!""  A few years ago, the sentence attributed to the teenager is the sort of thing that would stereotypically be assigned to a senator, while the sentence attributed to the senator would be stereotypically assigned to a teenager - however, now the situation has changed and so Randall comments that the internet has ended up in ""kind of a weird place"".   The title text discusses an idea that Randall approves of, originally suggested by a user on bash.org called h00k, where a twitter bot be created to message politicians when they use sms-speak unnecessarily. This would presumably embarrass said politicians, which might in turn lead to a decrease in their use of sms-speak. Randall evidently considers this a good thing, suggesting he finds the unnecessary use of sms-speak annoying.","[This is a chart with the above two labeled columns. The rows will be represented below in the same format.] If you post: you sound like ""Ron Paul is the only candidate who offers us a real choice!"": A teenager ""its gettin l8 so ill b here 4 prob 2 more hrs tops"": A senator The internet has wound up in kind of a weird place."
1084: Server Problem,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1084:_Server_Problem,computers,Protip: Annoy Ray Kurzweil by always referring to it as the 'Cybersingularity'.,"Cueball has messed up his Linux server, apparently not for the first time. Megan offers to take a look at the PC, and she casually types in 'ls' — a very basic command that lists the files in the current directory. The computer returns a bizarre error message — it trips over one of the simplest commands, indicating that Cueball's system is messed up. Really messed up.  The /usr/share path should indicate ""architecture-independent shared data"". Adobe is a software company that produces Acrobat, Flash and Photoshop. Android VM would be a virtual machine for Android. The .jar extension suggests a Java-language program. None of Adobe software, Android, or Java are needed to run 'ls'. All of the above have nothing to do with each other, with the exception that Android applications (but not core command line utilities, like ls) are written in Java. Also, basic system executables like 'ls' would never be placed within /usr/share or within some 'example' or 'doc' directory. On Linux, executables don't have filename extensions like "".exe"" or "".jar"". Additionally, it would require the folder to be within $PATH. In other words, the error message implies that the server is in a very bad state.  In the last frame Megan is bewildered by this result and asks what did you do. Cueball suggest a course of action which mimics a common error message: ""______ is busy, please try again later."" Obviously he has seen this type of message frequently enough to try it as a general cure in all similar cases.  Megan then tells Cueball to ""shut down the system and wait for the singularity,"" referring to a hypothetical future event when superintelligence can be artificially created. Since future superintelligent humans/computers transcend our comprehension, we can't predict or even understand what will happen after the singularity. One interpretation is that Megan is telling Cueball that his system is such a mess that it will take a post-singularity superintelligence to fix it (or run it in its current state, as only an intelligence beyond present comprehension would be capable of doing). It also indicates that 1668: Singularity could be the sequel to this comic.  The title text is yet another protip from Randall. Ray Kurzweil is an author and futurist who has talked and written much about a technological singularity. Presumably, mangling the jargon (by confusing the concept of the ""singularity"" with the science fiction term ""cyberspace"") is something Kurzweil (as an expert) would find annoying. Also, as Randall later pointed out in 1573: Cyberintelligence, the word has not really been used for a decade...","[Cueball at his computer calls out for Megan who comes walking in to the frame.] Cueball: I, um, messed up my server again.

1118: Microsoft,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1118:_Microsoft,computers,"Facebook, Apple, and Google all got away with their monopolist power grabs because they don't have any 'S's in their names for critics to snarkily replace with '$'s.","In the late 1990s Microsoft started bundling its web browser, Internet Explorer, with its Windows operating system. This effectively destroyed the Netscape company, who up until then had the most market share with its browser, Netscape Navigator. Microsoft was involved in a legal case against the U.S. government, which required Microsoft to allow IE to be uninstalled among other remedies. Removal of Internet Explorer has no clear solution as libraries and utilities associated with Internet Explorer are used across other Windows applications.  The comic sarcastically states that this stopped companies from creating a monopoly on software practices. Unfortunately, platform developers such as Apple, Sony, and Microsoft have restricted third-party software distribution over the internet via their own curated online stores in recent years, and will come full circle with the introduction of Metro Applications on the Windows 8. The comic also mocks the triviality of browser debates compared to current antitrust cases concerning privacy and price fixing.  Apple bundled a browser in on both its desktop and mobile platforms.  Apple also requires all iOS developers to sell their apps only through the iTunes app store, paying sizeable commissions to Apple, and Apple can refuse to sell any app. In some instances, Apple has developed its own versions of popular third-party apps.[1]  On Android, Google bundles in a mobile version of Chrome web browser (as of version 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich), but you are allowed to change the default browser. The company has a majority market share in web search engines, being the most popular search engine available. On Facebook, users face difficulties in accessing or removing their profiles and personal information, among other issues. Recently, this has been mitigated by the ability to download a zip file of all content ever posted to Facebook, but it still remains difficult to delete data from Facebook.  Apple has been widely criticized for trying to force all users of Mac OS or iOS to run only content approved by Apple and distributed through the Apple App Store, each sale from which gives royalty payments to Apple.  The title text refers to mocking Microsoft as Micro$oft or M$ for attempting to take too much money from consumers, and jokingly suggests that the inability to easily do this with other companies' names (Fa¢ebook? Appl€? Goog£e?)  is how they succeeded at amassing power where Micro$oft failed.",Megan: Remember when we prosecuted Microsoft for bundling a browser with an OS? Imagine the future we'd live in if we'd been willing to let one tech company amass that much power. Ponytail: Thank God we nipped that in the bud.

In the comic, Black Hat tires of Cueball's complaining and inserts a U+202e character in the middle of Cueball's speech, turning his complaints into gibberish - sentences that must be read from right-to-left.   The title of the comic builds on this theme, with the title of the webpage it is hosted on being LTR in some browsers (see trivia), the reverse of the comic name.  What Cueball actually tries to say after Black Hats change is:  When multiple writers work on the same text, arguments can often arise with some writers resorting to vandalizing the works of other writers. The title text takes this up a level, suggesting the use of U+202e and other direction control characters in editor wars to disrupt other people's work.

The single guy in the comic owns a home surrounded by an abundance of portals, which makes it an attractive destination for the three friends who contact him via the computer. They are obviously not really friends of the guy, but just wish to come by because of the portals.  The portals in the comic are controlled by the green ""Enlightened"" team (and have links and a field), making them valuable resource caches for the ""Enlightened"" team, and priority targets for the blue ""Resistance"" team.  Foursquare, referenced in the title text, is another service that lets users check into places they visit for discounts in a similar way to how Ingress players visit portals for points. Unlike Foursquare places, which are businesses and public places such as parks, Ingress portals also include historic houses that are still private residences, as well as churches, so Ingress is more likely to reward people visiting a friend's house. ""Space noises"" refers to the ambient sounds when playing Ingress.","[Three people around a computer. One of them is typing.] Typing: Hey, party tonight?

1168: tar,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1168:_tar,computers,"I don't know what's worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can't keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I'm still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started.","tar (""tape archive"") is a Unix application that creates (and extracts) archives in the "".tar"" format. It is typically used through the text-based terminal, using cryptic single-letter arguments such as ""tar -cvf archive.tar *"". The comic alludes to the fact that despite years of use of the command, it's still hard to remember the arguments without searching for them, such as with Google.  The title text points out that while much of computing changes very quickly, the tar program, which is very old (originating ca. 1975), is still around and heavily used. And yet, Randall complains he still cannot type out a line of tar command with correct flags without having to look the flags up. Tar is a very common command that Unix users will come across regularly, much like Windows users will come across .zip files. Depending on the flavor of Unix, the order of the flags, or the lack or inclusion of a '-' could render the command incorrect. Most true Unixes (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) not using the GNU utilities would give an error on the above tar example. For such a simple command, it is one that most people need to look up references to use.  The joke here is that a ""tar"" command with perfect syntax on the first try without outside help is such a daunting task that even Rob can't overcome it with confidence, and apologizes for not being able to prevent their imminent death.  The fact that Megan and White Hat assume that Rob can disarm the nuclear bomb because he uses Unix can be referring to an over-generalization fallacy that a partaker in a practice is an expert of a practice. Not all people who use Unix necessarily know how to use tar commands. Then again, since he's the only person nearby who knows any Unix and thus their only hope, their fallacy is pretty justified.  There is probably also a pun on ""tarbomb,"" a poorly created tar archive that, when extracted, dumps a load of files into the current directory that the user has to clean up. And although the bomb looks more like Fat Man, the type of bomb that was used over Nagasaki, at least size-wise, it may also be a pun on the name of the largest ever hydrogen bomb which was called the Tsar Bomba (translation: ""emperor bomb"").  In 208: Regular Expressions Cueball saves the day by knowing regular expressions, although in the title text it is alluded to how easy these may also miss a character.  Rob may refer to Rob Pike, who was a member of the team at AT&T who created Unix.","[Megan and White Hat stand next to a nuclear bomb. The bomb has a hatch open on top, and a small blinking screen.

1172: Workflow,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1172:_Workflow,computers,There are probably children out there holding down spacebar to stay warm in the winter! YOUR UPDATE MURDERS CHILDREN.,"Users will often try to work around bugs in software, and are sometimes able to get used to having the bugs around. Some bugs are even interpreted as features and users complain when the software authors fix them. A similar effect may be caused by other improvements, particularly those which involve changes in the user interface.  This comic shows a somewhat extreme example. An unnamed application had a bug causing the CPU to overheat whenever the spacebar was held down too long. In version 10.17, this bug was fixed. Soon, LongtimeUser4 complained that they relied on the fact that the CPU overheats if the spacebar is held down. They had stumbled across this ""feature"" (which is, again, more weird than usual) and took advantage of it to streamline their workflow, and they wanted an option to re-enable it.  Emacs (name originally derived from Editor MACroS) is a text editor originally written at MIT in 1976 and adopted into the GNU project in 1984. The control key sees extensive use in Emacs, and since it's hard to reach, users often remap it to Caps Lock or some other key. LongtimeUser4 fixed the problem very clumsily (""horrifying,"" as the admin puts it) and is annoyed that their kludge no longer works. The moral of the story is that you can't please everyone.  Examples of real life changes in software which, though often acclaimed by critics, caused great annoyance among existing user base include ribbons introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, Start screen of Windows 8 or Unity desktop manager bundled with Ubuntu since version 11.10. In the latter case, developers included an option to use the older interface; for the rest, applications emulating old behavior were developed by third parties.  The title text makes a hyperbole to humorous effect; children will freeze to death during the winter because they won't be warmed by a rather unconventional heater. Making (or creating an illusion of) a connection between one's opinion and care for children's welfare is a common method of gaining public support, as such arguments are hard to deflect without sounding cruel and uncaring.","[Changelog for version 10.17 of a piece of software.] One change listed: ""The CPU no longer overheats when you hold down the spacebar"" Comments: LongtimeUser4 writes: This update broke my workflow! My control key is hard to reach, so I hold spacebar instead, and I configured Emacs to interpret a rapid temperature rise as ""control"". Admin writes: That's horrifying. LongtimeUser4 writes: Look, my setup works for me. Just add an option to reenable spacebar heating.  Every change breaks someone's workflow."

In practice, this alternative is frequently worse than simply viewing the standard web page, for reasons offered in the comic:  The comic offers a brutally honest version of such a promotional popup. Alternatively to an app, some sites have a mobile version which is still an HTML-based website - just one that has been designed for mobile. These mobile versions (often denoted by being in an ""m."" subdomain) often have the same issues as above, or worse, because the sites do not have the benefit of the programmability of an app.  Compounding the frustration is that some sites aggressively promote their app/mobile version with a popup message that repeats the suggestion on every visit to the site, and as the title text notes, if you reject the popup, you end up on the site's homepage, rather than the subpage you may have been trying to reach via a web search.

1180: Virus Venn Diagram,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1180:_Virus_Venn_Diagram,computers,"Within five minutes of the Singularity appearing, somebody will suggest defragging it.","Randall uses an Euler diagram (technically not a Venn diagram) to make fun of clueless computer users. The circles in the diagram don't overlap, meaning problems that people suspect are caused by viruses are never really caused by viruses, and problems that are actually caused by viruses are never suspected by people to be caused by a virus.  When computers don't function as expected, a common response from ordinary users is ""Maybe it has a virus?"".  However, most of these situations can be explained by faulty hardware (freezing, blue screen, etc.) or software (crashes, errors, apparent lack of response to input, etc.), a general lack of maintenance (too slow to start up, too much clutter on screen, etc.), or user error.  A virus can potentially cause those symptoms, but it's much more common for them either to cause immediate and massive damage (rendering the computer completely unusable, wipe the disk, display obvious propaganda, etc.), or to remain stealthy with no obvious symptoms (logging keystrokes, exfiltrating sensitive information, receiving commands in the background, etc.).  Of course there is no clear separation and there is always some overlap between the two scenarios, so the diagram is not meant to be taken literally.  The title text refers to the technological singularity, a hypothetical point in the future when superintelligence emerges in computers, so that they can build new computers with ever increasing intelligence. It is seen as impossible to predict what would happen beyond this point; hence the term ""singularity"". 1084: Server Problem makes a joke on this.  ""Defragging"" is short for disk defragmentation, an easy, user-friendly action that PC users can undertake to supposedly make their computers run faster. It is therefore a common all-round recommendation to do this, regardless of the problem. Randall suggests the same clueless users would encounter the singularity and attempt defragging. It probably won't help much.","[Euler diagram with two circles that don't intersect.] Green circle: Computer problems that make people say, ""Maybe it has a virus?""

1197: All Adobe Updates,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1197:_All_Adobe_Updates,computers,"ALERT: Some pending mandatory software updates require version 21.1.2 of the Oracle/Sun Java(tm) JDK(tm) Update Manager Runtime Environment Meta-Updater, which is not available for your platform.","This comic was probably a reaction to the installation service Ninite removing Adobe Flash Player from their free version the previous day. Flash removed from Ninite  The comic makes fun of Adobe Systems software that delivers new versions of Adobe products to users' computers, such as Adobe Updater (which replaced Adobe Update Manager) and Adobe Download Manager (from Akamai). These software increments might either be technical (to fix compatibility or security issues), or they might add new features that would go unnoticed. In addition, these updates are downloaded automatically by default, but the operating system might install them only if a user allows it to. The frequency of software changes (and changes in the way Adobe allows users to download new software) could result in confused users. In this case, the comic is saying that you must update the program before it can actually check for updates, something it already seems to be doing.  There is an actual message that a specific version of these updaters display:  In fact, the general necessity of such update managers has often been questioned, as they require the user to ""download software in order to download other software"". Other notable examples of companies who use update managers include Google and Sun/Oracle, with the latter being also mentioned in the title text.  The two buttons 'OK' and 'Download' are implied to have the same effect, indicating the user has no real choice. Or, alternatively, 'OK' may simply just close the dialog without taking any action, as that is common in informational popups in many pieces of software. In that case, the placement of the 'OK' button implies that it is the default action, meaning most users will just ignore the update. Given the extreme frequency and perceived lack of changes (to your average end user), this anecdotally seems to be what most people do. Statistics for the high rate of un-patched systems in the wild support the anecdotal evidence.  The language of the message also plays with repeated up and down, as in ""there is an update for the Adobe download manager..."" to give the whole process a feel of preposterousness verging on Carrollian literary nonsense.  The title text also suggests that using update helper software which in turn must be updated bears the risk of creating a dependency hell.  The ""version 21.1.2 of the Oracle..."" may refer to the Rush suite 2112, where moment V is titled Oracle and contains the lyrics ""I stand atop a spiral stair, An oracle confronts me there.""",[Cueball is sitting at a laptop with a window with a red title bar floating over his head.] Adobe Update There is an update for: Adobe Download Manager  This update will allow you to download the new updates to the Adobe Update Downloader.

1200: Authorization,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1200:_Authorization,computers,"Before you say anything, no, I know not to leave my computer sitting out logged in to all my accounts. I have it set up so after a few minutes of inactivity it automatically switches to my brother's.","Computer operating systems were initially written for the business environment. Thus they were made to be accessible to multiple employees, or users, but only fully accessible to administrators (or admins). Regular users can access and use programs on the computer, but only the admin is allowed to make changes to how the computer runs.  This same split level of security continues to this day, even in privately owned, or ""home"", computers.  The joke here is that the most important things on a computer are no longer the programs that it runs, but the private personal data it accesses (usually online). Anyone who wished to do real mischief on an active computer could do considerable damage without ever caring what the admin password was. The admin password, in effect, now guards a vault no one cares about.  This comic pokes fun at the authorization mechanisms surrounding most operating systems' administrator accounts. It makes the argument that the user's data is more valuable than the integrity of the system. This is arguably true for most personal systems, although it is probably not true in a shared-server setup, where a system compromise could lead to the exposure of many users' data.  Essentially, once a user is logged in, he or she can typically access all of his or her data without any further restriction. Modifying the operating system (for example, to install drivers) requires a separate password.  In fact, this password protection also hinders installation of malware, which is otherwise possible even remotely, with the malware then being able to e.g. steal passwords, enabling a hacker anywhere in the world to access your accounts without ever needing to touch your computer. So having your computer set up to not to ask you for an administrator's password arguably implies a bigger risk of identity theft than allowing others to access your system physically while being logged in does.  The title text alludes to the security practice where computers automatically lock the user out after a few minutes, requiring a password from the user in order to continue using it. Instead, Randall's computer automatically switches to his brother's account, presumably compromising his data instead of Randall's.","[Diagram showing several connected rooms. One in the center says ""User account on my laptop,"" surrounded by ""Dropbox,"" ""Photos & files,"" ""Facebook,"" ""Gmail,"" ""PayPal,"" and ""Bank,"" which are connected to the middle room and to each other.

1223: Dwarf Fortress,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1223:_Dwarf_Fortress,computers,"I may be the kind of person who wastes a year implementing a Turing-complete computer in Dwarf Fortress, but that makes you the kind of person who wastes ten more getting that computer to run Minecraft.","This comic is a reaction to the recent reveal of a U.S. electronic telecom surveillance program called PRISM, run by the NSA. You can read a Guardian article about it. PRISM, leaked by a former NSA official, incited some controversy since it provides government access to private data (e-mails, videos, chats, file transfers, etc.).   Dwarf Fortress is a freeware strategy game in which the player builds a civilization by giving orders to — as opposed to directly controlling — a group of dwarves. It is famous for having a very detailed simulation of its world and for allowing deep micro-management (as well as an incredibly steep learning curve).  ""Big Brother"" means ""a tyrannical government body that constantly monitors all its citizens."" The term comes from the classic dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, wherein propaganda videos are narrated by an actor with the stage name of Big Brother and the dystopia's surveillance system is said to be monitored by Big Brother himself.  Cueball has a discussion with Big Brother (""corporate surveillance state""), in which he mocks Big Brother's interest in the inconsequential activity of playing a video game (""Dwarf Fortress"" in particular) by drawing a parallel between Big Brother's omniscient surveillance of Cueball and Cueball's omniscient surveillance of the dwarfs. Big Brother appears to be mortified when it realizes the accuracy of Cueball's comparison.  Informally, a system exhibits Turing-completeness when it is theoretically capable of executing any algorithm. One of the simplest Turing-complete systems is the Turing machine, a device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules — it can be proven to have the same capabilities as any ordinary programming language. Other very simple systems include Rule 110, lambda calculus, Conway's game of life, and Brainfuck. The reason we don't work with these is because they're a real pain in the ass. Would you rather build a network of spaceships that collide with each other to simulate the successor function, or just write i := i + 1?  A common CS nerd challenge is to prove the Turing-completeness of a system that wasn't intended to be that way — games in particular. The usual way to do this is to construct a Turing machine simulator within the system. It has been done for Dwarf Fortress, (infinite) Minesweeper (pdf), Magic the Gathering, Little Big Planet, Minecraft (another Minecraft example), Pokémon Yellow (through the elaborate use of many in-game glitches) and 3D chess (but see the note below). These kinds of proofs often involve formulating ridiculously complex creations just to simulate a little machine writing symbols on a tape!  (Technically, a computer is not really Turing-complete. A Turing-complete system has to have unlimited space, and that's not possible for a memory-limited computer or any software running inside it. But even if we don't have access to Turing-completeness, we can build a theoretical machine and show how it can be extended indefinitely. In a few of the games, we prove Turing-completeness in infinite variants.)  Finally, Randall makes a crack that users will try to nest their Turing-complete computers; after finishing his Turing-complete Dwarf Fortress computer, someone else will try to make the Dwarf Fortress computer run Minecraft (a highly inefficient process that would be a nightmare to co-ordinate, and would run incredibly slowly).","[Cueball sits at a desk with a computer, hands on the keyboard, talking to an unseen observer.] Cueball: If the corporate surveillance state monitors and controls every aspect of my life...

'But then won't the uploader get suspicious that it pauses at 301+ for a while? Why don't we just forge the number entirel--' ::BLAM:: 'The Council of 299 is adjourned.',"YouTube (a video sharing site) used to have an odd quirk in its view counter. When a video hits 301 views, the view counter briefly stops updating. This means that YouTube is checking the views to make sure that no foul play is going on. The choice of the number 301 is due to a harmless off-by-one error; Numberphile produced a video that explains all this very well. At times the number 301 catches some YouTubers off guard — for very popular videos, it may appear that the video has more likes than views.  YouTube added a ""301+"" to indicate that the video has reached the 301 point and is awaiting review.  More recently, however, YouTube has abolished this[1].  The author plays with the near coincidence of this number, and a conspiracy theory entity known as the Committee of 300. In this case, the video's first 300 views come from each of the Committee's council members who determine if the video will go viral. The video is then released to the public by sending it to a regular person (Cueball in this comic) making the total number of views 301.  The title text elaborates on this by explaining that the council also hypnotizes somebody to make him think they uploaded and shared that particular video.  According to the title text, the council does not seem to tolerate contradiction, because the member that suggests changing 301 to a random number to avoid suspicion is shot and silenced permanently and removed from the council.","[A secret society meets in a darkened chamber; a kitschy video involving two people and an RC helicopter is projected onto the background.] Master: ...then it is settled.

1229: Screensaver,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1229:_Screensaver,computers,I'm entering my 24th year of spending eight hours a day firing the Duck Hunt gun at the flying toasters. I'm sure I'll hit one soon.,"This comic features the ""Starfield"" screensaver, a popular Windows screensaver of the 1990s, which presents a moving starfield, like what would be seen by an observer moving past stars at superluminal speeds (see a video example). This illusion is generally created by drawing white dots on the computer screen, and then moving these dots outwards towards the edge of the screen before disappearing. Some of the ""stars"" appear to pass closer to the viewing point than others, resulting in movements of visually greater speeds, and more excitement; one can also fixate the center of the screen, hoping to see the appearance of a star as close as possible to it, which would later on pass very close to the viewpoint. This comic extends it to the situation where the observer actually collides with one of these stars, something that never happens with screensavers of this type. The ""signal lost"" error message appears because the source of the signal is no longer transmitting, since it was destroyed by colliding with said star.  The ""Duck Hunt gun"" is a reference to the NES Zapper used with the Nintendo Entertainment System game Duck Hunt, originally published in 1984. The user would point the Zapper at the connected television screen while playing Duck Hunt, and the NES would recognize whether or not the zapper was pointed at an appropriate target or not. ""Flying Toasters"" is another old screensaver (in the After Dark package, made for computers but not for the NES). In the title text, Randall states that he is trying to use the NES Zapper to shoot down flying toasters. However, the Flying Toaster screensaver and the NES Zapper are two separate things that were never meant to be used together, so the flying toasters will never react to being ""shot"" at by the NES Zapper.","I've been staring at the screen every night for twenty years, and it finally happened.

1247: The Mother of All Suspicious Files,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1247:_The_Mother_of_All_Suspicious_Files,computers,Better change the URL to 'https' before downloading.,"The save dialogue shows a download from 65.222.202.53, an IP address that hosted JavaScript malware during a recent attack on the Tor anonymity network, with a very long file title. Many of the extensions used inside there indicate executable code; multiple file extensions are sometimes used to disguise a trojan program as a document.  You also see common download syntax for a pirated movie, Hackers, likely included to appear malicious to anyone skimming but is actually a movie about hackers, making it a benign reference rather than malicious. It is described as ""_BLURAY_CAM"", which contradicts itself (""_BLURAY"" would mean it was ripped from a copy on Blu-ray Disc, while ""_CAM"" would mean it was copied by pointing a camera at the screen in the cinema). ""_BLURAY_CAM"" would probably indicate a search-keyword-stuffed fake copy; fake pirated media often contain viruses (although this is more likely to be a problem with newer media, before the first real pirated copy appears).  The URL contains the path ""~tilde/pub/cia-bin/etc"". The first part is a public folder of a user named tilde (which is also the name for the ~ symbol), ""cgi-bin"" is a common folder on a Web-Server for server side executables (Randall changes the name to CIA-bin), and ""etc"" is a standard folder for configuration files – normally never accessible through a webserver. The program ""init.dll"" isn't executable at all, it's a Windows Dynamic Link Library which can't be run standalone, and is rarely referenced in URLs (even though such syntax is still being employed, even on reputable websites (Google search) or here at eBay, indicating the webserver is a Microsoft ASP server). The question mark indicates the start of a parameter list, and in this case we have only one named ""FILE"".  The ""Save"" button is disabled; you can only click the ""Cancel"" button. This can be different when the server detects that you are using a secure (https) connection.  The complete content sent to the server, starting with ""/~TILDE..."" and ending with ""...OUT.EXE"", is exactly 256 characters long. On HTML 3 specifications you have a limitation of 1024 characters, whereas later HTML specifications don't have this limit; it just depends on the web server's capabilities. But posting parameters directly at the URL is still a worse choice.  The content of the parameter is shown here:  The title text suggests changing from http to https, as if encrypting a suspicious file before downloading it is somehow better than downloading it unencrypted. http (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and https (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - Secure) are the two common protocols for getting web pages and web downloads. http is the simple download, whereas https adds an SSL encryption layer so the item being downloaded cannot be viewed unencrypted by anyone except the end recipient. Changing http to https is a common suggestion to improve security when browsing the web from an insecure network (such as a public WiFi hotspot) to avoid surveillance or hijacking to a malicious website; Google automatically switches to https for all mail accounts and is starting to do so with searches. The end recipient will still get whatever nasties were in the original, however — encrypting it doesn't change the content at all.

Such actions are not necessary on any well-designed website. Actively unfriending people individually could be perceived as rude, antisocial, or in need of help.  Even though one may not have visited a social network for years, they are still sitting there, gathering one's ""friends""' statuses, opinions and comments.   The reverse order to unfriend people refers to correct memory allocation and deallocation processes for computers. If one does not follow this process and deallocates an older memory block before a newer one, all information about the newer block could be lost. This would prevent the user from being able to deallocate it. If the process repeats over and over, memory usage will accumulate and will eventually result in an out of memory error.   This is not needed on databases, but databases used on websites, such as social networking sites, could run into a similar issue. If accounts are deactivated the users that were friends to the deactivated account may maintain the link to the deactivated account. This could (if the database was not well designed) create a non trivial amount of garbage data.  In the title text, ""database linkage accumulation slowdown"" really is a thing that Randall just made up. This may be a satire of popular fears of made-up technological problems, often held by those who are not technologically savvy.","[Caption above the frame:] The internet is filled with derelict accounts aggregating news about friends long forgotten.

1263: Reassuring,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1263:_Reassuring,computers,"At least humans are better at quietly amusing ourselves, oblivious to our pending obsolescence' thought the human, as a nearby Dell Inspiron contentedly displayed the same bouncing geometric shape screensaver it had been running for years.","Go is an abstract strategy board game considered computationally difficult, compared to chess. Because of the size and number of possible combinations, computers don't have an easy way to exhaustively search for the best move. Still, they are getting better and better playing it. Megan suggests that computers may soon reach the level of being able to beat the best human players, an artificial intelligence milestone that has already been accomplished with other games. At the time of this comic, Go was one of the last games where a computer can still be beaten by top humans (see 1002: Game AIs). However, in May 2017, Google's AI AlphaGo defeated the world's top human Go player. This was referenced three months later in 1875: Computers vs Humans.  As a common human response, Cueball attempts to offer the consolation or defensive statement that humans remain better than computers at something else (see also 894: Progeny). In this case, the first thing he thinks of is that humans are better at making such consoling statements. However, Megan disproves Cueball's statement by creating a script in the Python programming language to create an abundant supply of such statements.  An irony here is that each of the statements the computer generates defends humans, not computers.  Another such statement is made in the title text, that humans are better at quietly amusing themselves, oblivious to our ""pending obsolescence"" - which may refer alternatively to our inevitable deaths, or to the comic's own topic of our being replaced and surpassed by computers. The title text then again suggests, however, that the human statement is not true, referring to an Inspiron model of Dell computer which ""quietly amuses itself"" by showing a geometric screensaver as it presumably one day will be obsolete and replaced by a newer computer.  The original purpose of screensaver programs was to prevent images or characters from being burned into the phosphor layer of the older CRT displays. In more modern displays, including newer CRTs (cca mid-90s or newer), this could be achieved by simply turning it off after some period of time but originally there was no way to turn the display off programmatically. Thus the screensaver itself is already obsolete.","[Megan is sitting at a computer, and Cueball is standing behind her.] Megan: Looks like computers will beat humans at Go pretty soon. Cueball: Wow.

1266: Halting Problem,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1266:_Halting_Problem,computers,"I found a counterexample to the claim that all things must someday die, but I don't know how to show it to anyone.","In 1936 Alan Turing proved that it's not possible to decide whether an arbitrary program will eventually halt, or run forever. This was later called the Halting problem by Martin Davis. The official definition of the problem is to write a program (actually, a Turing Machine) that accepts as parameters a program and its parameters. That program needs to decide, in finite time, whether that program will ever halt running these parameters.  The halting problem is a cornerstone problem in computer science. It is used mainly as a way to prove a given task is impossible, by showing that solving that task will allow one to solve the halting problem.  Randall, however, is providing a simpler solution. He implements his own code for the question ""Does it halt?"" which always returns ""true"", and directs us to think about the bigger picture.  From a physical perspective, according to our current understanding of physics, this is right. Given enough time, any program will halt. This is due to factors external to the actual program. Sooner or later, electricity will give out, or the memory containing the program will get corrupted by cosmic rays, or corrosion will eat away the silicon in the CPU, or the second law of thermodynamics will lead to the Heat death of the universe. Nothing lasts forever, and this includes a running program.  From a mathematical point of view, this is not true: a Turing machine will never have a hardware failure because it's not a physical machine. It's a theoretical construct, and it's defined mathematically, independent of any physical hardware. Similarly, ⅓ + ⅓ + ⅓ = 1 no matter what any physical hardware you are computing it on claims.  Another interpretation of Randall's code is that the Program in the parentheses is actually being run whenever his function is called, as is consistent with some programming constructs. In this case, the function would wait until the program finishes and exits before returning ""True"". Therefore, Randall's function is mathematically accurate. It does not solve the problem though, as it simply shifts the question to whether the function itself will ever halt.  From a practical point of view, there are of course times that a programmer would want to return ""false"", since some programs can be mathematically shown to run forever.  The title text further relates to this issue by claiming to have found a case where something need not die, but Randall does not know how to actually show it to anyone, because just the fact everyone will die sooner than it doesn't prove it will not die. The wording of the title text might also be a reference to Fermat's Last Theorem.  It should be noted that Randall's solution, barring its unsoundness, solves more than the halting problem in the form it is usually stated. The halting problem requires two parameters (a program and its parameters), while Randall's function only accepts one (the program). The question of whether a program halts for every input can be shown to be even harder to solve than the halting problem, meaning that even if a Turing machine had an additional instruction allowing it to check whether a program halts with given parameters, it still could not always confirm that a given program that halts for all parameters does so.  The code in this comic is written in pseudocode, to demonstrate the ""algorithm"" rather than an implementation in some existing programming language. The syntax resembles a mix of C and Python.",[A short computer program.]  The big picture solution to the halting problem.
1269: Privacy Opinions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1269:_Privacy_Opinions,computers,I'm the Philosopher until someone hands me a burrito.,"According to the title, the comic is about opinions on internet privacy in general. Six positions are offered as options. Four of the positions are tagged negatively by the author by their subtitles alone: the Crypto Nut, the Conspiracist, the Nihilist, and the Exhibitionist, all of which have negative valences in contemporary English. That the viewer is encouraged to identify negatively with these four positions is further encouraged by the content of the panels, as those characters are depicted either as having such boring lives that they have no need for privacy (the Crypto Nut, the Nihilist), or as being crazy (the Conspiracist, the Exhibitionist).  A fifth position, the Philosopher, is tagged somewhat ambivalently by the author: Megan, or possibly a look-alike, is depicted as boring her interlocutor, yet in the title text, the author admits that he is usually the Philosopher. Also, ""Philosopher"" in vernacular English is neutrally valenced, potentially having the ability to expound either wisdom (sophia) or sophistry. It is also a synonym for Sage, the sixth position. As the author condones his own movement from Philosopher to Sage, he thus indicates that the Philosopher is to be viewed negatively, even if it is a tempting position to hold.  The title of the sixth position, the ""Sage"", is positively valenced in contemporary English, and the author in the title text states that once he obtains a ""burrito"" – i.e., a ""real"" thing, he switches from the Philosopher to the Sage. The internal evidence presented thus far therefore is entirely consistent; the author encourages the reader to identify with the Sage. However, the choice of Beret Guy to represent the Sage undercuts this somewhat as Beret Guy is frequently seen as bizarrely disconnected from reality in a way that is maladaptive (e.g. 1030: Keyed) and overly obsessed with food to the point of creating trouble and potential self-harm (e.g. 452: Mission).  By presenting five negatively tagged positions followed by a positively tagged sixth and final one, the author follows a rhetorical commonplace of listing and refuting a number of positions one by one, concluding with the favored and best one, which is not refuted and should be accepted both on its own merits and by virtue of being the last one standing. The comic therefore implies that no other (significant) positions exist.  Having completed the rhetorical analysis of the comic, we are now in a position to understand the meaning of ""Internet Privacy"".  Panels #3 and 5 directly reference the American NSA. Panel #5's ""exhibitionist"" also references Google, but the characters in the panel appear to be NSA agents (one wears an official cap and they are viewing the exhibitionist on an official, government-looking monitor). Likewise, the focus of the ""Nihilist"" is that the joke is on the people who gather the data, rather than those who are subsequently able to make use of it (such as Facebook's users rather than ""Facebook"" itself; i.e., Facebook's employees and, by extension, its advertisers). The content of the actual data is only mentioned in panels #2, 4, and 5, and in each panel, it is suggested that it is meaningless or trivial. The Sage underscores the notion that any data known about him does not bother him, and therefore must be meaningless or trivial. The reader is thus encouraged to believe that it does not actually matter whether others discover personal data about him/her.  The comic is therefore what social theorists call reductive, because it reduces the range of possibilities of ""Opinions on Internet Privacy"" to an artificially and simplistically narrow subset; in this case, individuals concerned with government or corporate agencies using data that they have gathered on individuals, and the futility of worrying about such things. The comic does not admit the possibility of other ""opinions on internet privacy"" – namely, that individuals might have legitimate concerns with governmental or corporate uses of their data, let alone other individuals' access to data that is assembled and distributed by corporations such as Facebook. The comic likewise does not consider the possibility of individuals having more interesting lives than the characters depicted, and therefore very real concerns about their privacy due to the activities that they engage in that are potentially more career limiting (should they be discovered) than obsessing about cryptography or eating a burrito.  The comic is ""functionally"" reductive, as opposed to ""intentionally"" reductive, because the reduction is the function or effect of the comic for readers who read it straightforwardly. There is not enough internal evidence in the comic to maintain that the author intentionally excluded other viable opinions on internet privacy; it could be that they are just not on his radar. For example, we do not have enough information in the comic to claim that the author is against civil rights; it could be simply that he doesn't often think about them. Likewise, it would exceed the evidence of the comic to claim that the author believes that schoolteachers who use the internet to facilitate legal but frowned-upon sexual behaviors should lose their jobs if they are found out due to internet privacy breaches; it could be that the author simply hasn't bothered to worry about these matters if they don't affect him personally. This adjudication – whether the comic is ""intentionally"" reductive or not – may only be made on the basis of external evidence; that is, data known about the author from sources beyond this comic.  An alternative interpretation of the title text is that it is not Randall speaking his own opinion, but instead represents Beret Guy's (i.e. the ""Sage's"") perspective. Randall may indeed have some concern with internet privacy, which would be consistent with the views on open-source security expressed in 463: Voting Machines, for example. In other cases, such as 1490: Atoms and 1419: On the Phone, the title text has been used as additional, farcical statements made by characters in the strip, rather than as Randall expressing his own views. Under this interpretation, Beret Guy would be prone to philosophizing about security, but then be easily distracted by a burrito; this is consistent with Beret Guy's general behavior.  Additional observations about the comic follow.  The release of the comic on this date could be to coincide with the premiere of South Park's 17th season on the same date, which starts with an episode (Let Go, Let Gov) in which Cartman discovers that the NSA has been spying on him.  The title text is to suggest that he enjoys burritos so much that being handed one even while philosophizing (his natural state) would stop him in his tracks to eat the burrito, thus becoming a pseudo-sage concerned only with the burrito at the exclusion of the topic of internet security. The burrito is later mentioned as a way to stay connected to the real word (compared to the world of art) in 1496: Art Project.","Opinions on Internet Privacy The Philosopher: Megan: ""Privacy"" is an impractical way to think about data in a digital world so unlike the one in which our soci-- Ponytail:  So bored.   The Crypto Nut: Cueball: My data is safe behind six layers of symmetric and public-key algorithms. Friend: What data is it? Cueball: Mostly me emailing with people about cryptography.  The Conspiracist: Cueball talks to Megan. Cueball: These leaks are just the tip of the iceberg. There's a warehouse in Utah where the NSA has the entire iceberg. I don't know how they got it there.  The Nihilist: Megan: Joke's on them, gathering all this data on me as if anything I do means anything.  The Exhibitionist: Cueball is watching a surveillance console, Officer Ponytail stands behind him. Console: Mmmm, I sure hope the NSA isn't watching me bite into these juicy strawberries!! Oops, I dripped some on my shirt! Better take it off. Google, are you there? Google, this lotion feels soooo good. Cueball: Um.  The Sage: Beret Guy and Cueball sitting at a table. Beret Guy: I don't know or care what data anyone has about me. Data is imaginary. This burrito is real."
1306: Sigil Cycle,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1306:_Sigil_Cycle,computers,"The cycle seems to be 'we need these symbols to clarify what types of things we're referring to!' followed by 'wait, it turns out words already do that.'","In computer programming, a variable is a way of storing information temporarily, for use later in the program. There are different types of variables, called data types, such as integers, strings, characters, and booleans, all of them holding different types of information. Integers hold whole numbers, strings hold text, and so on. Variables traditionally have names that identify their purpose, and a programmer should usually be able to infer from this variable name what type of variable it is. For example, if you want to store the name of the customer in a catalogue service, you might store the text in a string variable called ""NameOfCustomer"". Because it is fairly clear that names are made up of text, it is logical that this variable would be a string variable - if you didn't have any other information about it.  A sigil in computer programming is a symbol that appears before the variable name. It is an alternative method of telling someone who is reading the program code what data type the variable is. Rather than relying on logic, then, to know that NameOfCustomer is a string, you might use a sigil ""$"" before the variable name, as in $NameOfCustomer, which would specify that the variable can hold text. Sigils can also specify the scope of a variable, which refers to where the variable can be used in a program, and which parts of the program can access that variable. Sigils are useful in some ways because you don't have to refer to previous program code or find where the variable is declared (created) to know what data type it is. They also provide some level typing in languages that do not explicitly declare the type of the variable.  Most programming languages have a different method for storing variables, although some languages may use the same variable types under different names. The following are the programming languages referenced in the comic and how they use variables.  As is noted by the comic, the use of sigils to indicate types of variables varies between programming languages, from strict enforcement in languages like Perl, to their complete absence in languages like C++ (but see Hungarian Notation). The comic notes that the use of sigils seems to be cyclic, especially if you count things like hashtags as extensions of the pattern.  The title text describes the two competing influences responsible for the cycle: The first impulse finds sigils useful to elucidate the type of the variable, especially when variable names are not very descriptive, while the latter impulse notes that descriptive variable names are much more useful for that purpose, especially in extensible languages where the built-in types form only a small part of the type system.","A sinusoidal curve is shown.

'No.',"Cueball's laptop has a problem that has resisted many hours of concentrated effort at resolution. Megan offers to help, but she concludes that the laptop is literally possessed by an evil spirit.  A similarly unresolvable problem can be seen in 1084: Server Problem. In that case, no haunting is suggested, and Megan suggests that Cueball give up and wait for the Singularity.  The title text continues the conversation: when Megan tries to return the laptop to Cueball, he refuses, as Megan willingly took possession of it in the first place. Both have clearly decided that they no longer want anything to do with an object housing a supernatural entity, and are trying to pass it back to one another.","[Cueball sits at a desk with a laptop, making a fist at it.] Cueball: Argh!

1323: Protocol,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1323:_Protocol,computers,"Changing the names would be easier, but if you're not comfortable lying, try only making friends with people named Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.","Alice, Bob, and Eve are role names traditionally used in describing cryptographic protocols. Rather than talking about ""Person A"", ""Person B"", ""Person C"", names beginning with each letter are used instead, and giving them different genders let pronouns be used to shorten discussions. For example: ""Person A sends Person B a message encoded with Person B's public key"" is much easier to parse when written as ""Alice sends Bob a message encoded with his public key."" Eve is short for ""eavesdropper"" - a person trying to find out what's being said in the conversations between the other people. The classic situation involves Alice wanting to send a secret message to Bob, while Eve (the eavesdropper), attempts to read the message, ideally without Alice or Bob ever finding out. Additional participants such as Carol (Person C) can be added if necessary. The list of names has become very standardised over time as described at Alice and Bob.  The joke here is that any computer scientist, hearing the names used, will think that they are listening to a cryptography problem. By changing the names in a story to these role names, you can induce them to listen carefully to boring stories. The fewer the interesting details, the more it sounds like a general problem, so very boring stories are actually the easiest.  The title text shows a more radical approach to the problem, for people who do not feel comfortable about lying. In this approach, you only make friends with people who have the appropriate names already.  The comic title also can be interpreted in two ways. First, the computer scientist thinks the conversation is about an encryption protocol. Second, the way the conversation is carried resembles a protocol used by many data communication systems, where one side sends data while the other sends back an acknowledgement upon receiving the data. In this case, the data are the lines of the boring story.  In comic 177: Alice and Bob these names are used in the same context. Instead of Alice and Bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private, Bob is actually having an affair with Alice. Eve —his former partner— cracked the encryption to see what the message contained. Thus, this comic seems to continue the Alice/Bob romance, jealous-Eve plot, with Eve apparently confronting Alice over her text message to Bob.","[Cueball is telling a story to a Computer Scientist who is seated at his desk.] Cueball: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere. Computer Scientist: Uh huh. Cueball: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place. Computer Scientist: With you so far. Cueball: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet. Computer Scientist: Yeah? CAPTION: I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story."
1328: Update,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1328:_Update,computers,I have a bunch of things open right now.,"When developers responsible for fixing errors on a specific operating system release a patch, the operating system often ask users to restart the computer after installing. This is often done by popup window shown to the user where he can choose to restart immediately or choose to be reminded later.  Many messages from these popups emphasize the importance of installing the updates, but Cueball is just annoyed about this. Sometimes, these issues are minor and do not affect most computers using the operating system. Often other programs, not part of the operating system, ask for a reboot because the updated routine only runs after the next reboot. Regardless, reboots can take a long time — a typical user doesn't like this. The user can choose to be reminded later multiple times. Because rebooting a computer takes a significant amount of time and closes any programs running, a user may delay the update repeatedly to avoid interrupting what they were doing at the time.  The comic is making two jokes simultaneously: the core comic jokes that reboots are so tedious and disruptive it would actually be preferable for a laptop to burst into flame than to go through one, while the title text suggests that the real problem is that humans are so incapable of delayed gratification and/or risk evaluation they would rather risk bodily harm than suffer a minor inconvenience.  The joke uses an ""exploding laptop battery"" as an exaggeration for comedic effect. Most software doesn't affect hardware issues like burning laptop batteries. However, low-level software, such as the kernel or drivers, might cause hardware to misbehave.  The title text reflects the fact that the average user will have multiple applications open and a reboot would require closing them. They would then have to open all their applications again after the computer has restarted. This can also refer to a browser application having multiple tabs open. This is becoming less of an issue because browsers have an option to restart the last session again after being closed, as would happen with a reboot, but many users still don't trust it to work properly.",[Cueball sits at a desk.

1337: Hack,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1337:_Hack,computers,HACK THE STARS,"This comic is an imagined project to re-position the ISEE-3/ICE probe, and a parody of the 1995 movie Hackers. The first row (four panels) explain the history of the probe, and the true story about how the probe was coming back into signal range and seemed capable of being controlled. NASA declined to attempt to regain control of the probe, but a group of enthusiasts assembles the equipment and attempts to re-purpose the probe.   The following two rows (eight panels) set up a fictional scenario: the enthusiasts have been locked out of the system, the probe is being controlled by someone else, and the message ""Mess with the best, die like the rest"" is communicated from the probe. This is a catch phrase of the protagonist, Crash, from Hackers.  The final row is a reference to the ending of the movie, where Crash romances Burn, his romantic interest, in a rooftop pool. In the movie, while Crash and Burn swim in a rooftop pool, several buildings light up with the words ""CRASH AND BURN"". This is their friends' latest hack, and an attempt to provide romance for the new couple. In the comic the transmitter being used to communicate with ISEE-3 was hacked by Burn to make the probe burn up over Crash and Burn swimming in the pool providing a ""shooting star"" for romantic effect.  The comic number is 1337, which stands for ""leet"", short for ""elite hacker"" and ""leetspeek"" in leetspeak. Leetspeak is a form of symbolic writing that substitutes various numbers and ASCII symbols for letters. It originates from the hacker subculture, where words were converted to leetspeek e.g. to avoid filters and triggers on chat rooms. ""1337"" for ""leet"" can most likely be explained as calculator spelling.  The title text ""Hack the stars"" is also an allusion to Hackers, where the phrase ""Hack the planet!"" is used on multiple occasions.  This project since became reality, as Randall noted in a blag post. See details below.  The ISEE-3/ICE probe was launched in August 12, 1978 and tasked to study Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind. Before completing its original mission the probe was repurposed on June 10, 1982 to study the interaction between the solar wind and a cometary atmosphere. By flying through the comet Giacobini-Zinner's tail, it became the first probe to do so. This put ISEE-3 in a heliocentric orbit. Its trajectory will bring it close to Earth on August 2014.  The Deep Space Network (DSN) detected the probe again in 2008 because NASA mistakenly left its transmitters on. However, the probe was only transmitting the carrier signal at that time. A status check of the spacecraft has revealed that many of its instruments are still working and that it contains plenty of fuel.[1]  It was reported that the hardware to communicate with ISEE-3/ICE had been decommissioned. The Madrid DSS complex still has the special filter required to communicate with the ICE satellite, but because of frequency conflicts S-band uplink is not supported.[2]  On March 1 and 2, 2014 radio amateurs were able to detect the beacon signal from the retired NASA deep space probe ICE (International Cometary Explorer) using the 20 m radio telescope at the Bochum Observatory (Germany).[3]  After this comic was published, it was established that an 18-meter satellite dish at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory does still have the right hardware.  See Space College: ISEE-3 Reboot Project Archives for the coverage of this amazing project.","[A black image shows an image of the ISEE-3/ICE spacecraft in white.

1349: Shouldn't Be Hard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1349:_Shouldn%27t_Be_Hard,computers,(six hours later) ARGH. How are these stupid microchips so durable?! All I want is to undo a massive industrial process with household tools!,"This comic refers to a sentiment sometimes expressed by computer users that ""what I'm trying to do is really simple — it shouldn't be hard.""  The statement demonstrates an assumption that because the desired action is conceptually simple, it must therefore be simple to implement. There is a logic to this line of thinking, but in reality, as the off-screen character notes, a computer is a very complicated set of components which effectively can't do anything (simple or complex) until someone has programmed the functionality into it. Even more abstractly, a random silicon crystal can't do anything at all until someone has applied a complex industrial process to it that allows it to read and execute computer code in the first place.  In terms of a user-interface, the ""simplicity"" of executing a given task may be more a function of the perceived utility and frequency-of-use of that function, and less a function of its conceptual ""simplicity"". For example, changing the colour of the font in a word processor is often simpler than changing the colour of the background/page, even though changing colours of two parts of the document would appear equally ""simple"" in concept. The different implementation is a design choice by the programmer most likely on the basis that the intended user is considered more likely to want to change the font colour than to change the page colour.  This sentiment equally applies to computer programmers: most commonly when they are just beginning to learn a new computer language. Sometimes because of difficulties with the syntax rules of the language or similar problems, a programmer may spend a long time trying to get the computer to do a simple action, such as display a message on the screen, or ask the user for a number. This is also true when a programmer is working in a language which doesn't have an easy way to do something that might be simple in another language. And in computer science, it may often be very hard to differentiate the almost impossible from the easy, especially when compared to what humans can and can't do easily.  The off-screen character points out that computers were ""just carefully organized sand"". Modern computer chips are made largely of silicon crystals, chemically a part of silicon dioxide crystals that compose the majority of sand. The character puts Cueball's goal in perspective by pointing out the large amount of complexity required to make, what is essentially sand, do even the simplest of computational tasks.  The punchline of the comic is that, after considering these words of wisdom for a panel, instead of the anticipated response of Cueball coming to the realization that the off-screen character is right, and working even harder to solve his problem, Cueball instead succumbs to his annoyance and sets out to destroy his computer (which he characterizes as turning it ""back into sand""). The off-screen character helpfully offers to get a blowtorch so that Cueball can melt the computer down into simple compounds and elements.  The title text sees Cueball again frustrated with a task he considers ""simple"" (destroying the computer). Cueball appears to be oblivious to the irony in his statement that he is having trouble destroying something with household tools that required very large machines and an industrial process to create. This might be compared to trying to undo a steel weld by lighting a wooden match and trying to melt the weld with it. This points out the irony that destroying the processor is even harder to do than the task from the first picture.  The melting point of silicon is 1,414 °C. Although a typical butane blowtorch that might be found in a kitchen has a maximum temperature of 1,430 °C, that temperature is at a very small point and rapidly cools. Hence it is unlikely that you could focus sufficient heat with a kitchen appliance blowtorch to actually melt silicon.  The apparently simple task Cueball is trying to complete may express Randall's frustration in the creation of the crowd-sourced comic 1350: Lorenz, which was launched the next day and initially contained a large number of bugs.",[Cueball is typing on a laptop.] Cueball: What I'm trying to do is really simple. Cueball: It shouldn't be hard.  Offscreen: All computers are just carefully organized sand. Everything is hard until someone makes it easy.

1350: Lorenz,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1350:_Lorenz,computers,"Every choice, no matter how small, begins a new story","This April fools' comics was posted a day earlier than normal (on Tuesday instead of Wednesday) to honor April Fools' Day of 2014. It is an interactive and dynamic comic with the first picture shown on top of this page, with a possible combination of text options to choose from (see above). The picture is always the same but the order of the four sentences is chosen randomly (and there can be more than four). The result of all the interactions by the readers led to the generation of crowd-sourced content. The title 'Lorenz' is referring to Edward Norton Lorenz who, among other subjects, was famous for Chaos theory and the Butterfly effect (mentioned later in the title text of 1519: Venus). This comic is an example of a Choose Your Own Adventure story as mentioned in the title text. The title text is also a reference to how the story line of this comic will be chaotic by nature, since it includes all of the user submitted dialogue and updates over time based on statistics of user clicks. In this manner, it is a reference to the butterfly effect, a phrase coined by Edward Lorenz to describe how a small initial change can lead to wide variations in outcome in a chaotic system. Every time a story comes to a point where the user can either choose something or contribute when asked to Suggest a line then a link will appear by hovering the mouse over the bottom right corner of the last image. This is named a permalink as it is a link that will recreate this particular story up to the point, making it permanent. It will not save the options listed below that image (i.e. the order of these will change, new options may appear, either because more than four is already present or new will be added and some options may even disappear). An option is thus only saved by choosing it and then saving the next permalink - see more below. The best way to enjoy this comic is to try it yourself! If you didn't do that already, reading any below will spoil you from truly enjoying the comic, and maybe make some interesting discoveries yourself! So here is a spoiler alert if you read on. If you do then see also the section below about Functionality and bugs. Any particular story-line will typically only have one or two of the many themes possible in the comic, but some very long stories may have several, see the Record section below. Several of the themes refer to previous comics or generally recurring themes in xkcd. Most obviously is the blowtorch theme which is a direct reference to the previous comic 1349: Shouldn't Be Hard where the last comment is I'll find a blowtorch as a response to Cueball's frustration over his problems. Because it is not always ending ""as well"" as with a burnt PC, they might instead end up in a shark infested ocean - see the Ocean theme, which is a direct reference to 349: Success, a comic that came exactly 1000 comics before the other one referenced in the same computer problem theme. In that comic the sharks had not appeared yet, but here there may be several, and sharks is also a recurring topic in xkcd. These issues with computers is generally a reference to the computer problems themes that precedes both the burning of the laptop and the ocean story-lines, because Knit Cap Girl, the new character from the first image, tries to install BSD, and then when it fails she takes her friend Hairy with her in the fall, in the water, into space or into a Pokémon fight etc. as they are the two main character of this comic. Also Cueball (as a politician vs. another politician with hair) and White Hat has small appearances, but only in a small sections of particular story-line. Only few others interact directly with the main characters in the rest of the possible stories. Other themes that are recurring in xkcd is Politics, Pokémon, Boomerangs and Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs enter the comic in the form of the green talking T-rex from Dinosaur Comics, a clip-art-based webcomic that uses the same artwork with different captions for every strip. This particular Dinosaur Comics has a title text that actually refer to Randall and xkcd, and the comic has previously appeared on xkcd in 145: Parody Week: Dinosaur Comics. A way to combine more than one story line is to let characters wake up from a dream or a nightmare, as can be see in the Dreams theme, and dreams is also a recurring topic. Here it can even get recursive so there can be dreams within dreams. One of the way to wake from a dream is of course by encountering a dinosaur that tries to step on your house (with you inside), but another is in reference to the possible rocket trip that may take the characters into space. See the Space theme another recurring topic. There are a few other topics that are covered by Randall himself, but many others will be referenced in the text in the comic. However, since most of the options the users have is created by user input, including naming the characters different names, then any reference made by the text, is not considered part of Randall's work, and will only sporadically be mentioned below under the themes section, and not be included as a category. Here is an example with a permalink where the last comment, in the ocean with a shark, references Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared less than a month before this comic was released and has still to been found two years later. But this is a user input not Randall's. Some of the idea of this comic was used again in the next year's April Fools' comic 1506: xkcloud, where user input also generated a very complex comic and the concept of permalink was used again.","[This transcript only transcribes what can be seen in the picture shown at the top of the explanation here.]  [The comic starts with two panels.

1353: Heartbleed,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1353:_Heartbleed,computers,"I looked at some of the data dumps from vulnerable sites, and it was... bad. I saw emails, passwords, password hints. SSL keys and session cookies. Important servers brimming with visitor IPs. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, c-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I should probably patch OpenSSL.","The Heartbleed bug refers to a critical bug in the OpenSSL cryptographic library. This bug was publicly revealed on Monday, 7 April 2014. Due to a programming error in OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f — meaning the bug had existed for two years — attackers could read random server memory by sending specially prepared HeartbeatRequest messages to an affected server.  OpenSSL is a very commonly used library to implement SSL/TLS, a cryptographic protocol not only used to secure web traffic but also for mail clients and much more. Only the user and the server can read the communication. On the web the protocol is https:// (HTTP Secure), instead of the open http:// standard. SSL is often used to protect sensitive web traffic, such as login requests, which contains the user names and passwords in the requests. The server sends a certificate to the browser before the secure connection is established. If the certificate is registered the browser accepts it automatically, otherwise the user gets a popup to accept or reject this insecure certificate.  A vulnerability that lets an attacker read random clumps of memory on the server would possibly let an attacker find recent username/password requests, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Even worse, this vulnerability could read the server's private key, enabling anyone to impersonate the server and/or decrypt any future traffic that relies on that key, and any previously-obtained prior traffic also, unless a ""perfect forward secrecy"" ciphers is used, which is currently rare. Furthermore, the Heartbleed exploit occurs during the handshake phase of setting up a connection, so no traces of it are logged, i.e. you can be attacked and never be the wiser.  More information is available at heartbleed.com or under the reference CVE-2014-0160 at nvd.nist.gov.  In the last panel, Megan interprets Cueball's question (""is everything compromised?"") expansively. She responds that, being a computer bug, Heartbleed can only affect information which is stored on computers. Cueball concludes that information recorded in analog media, such as that written on paper or etched in clay tablets, is safe. Megan adds that imaginations are also unaffected by Heartbleed, and Cueball is reassured. The reader may wonder how our society would fare in the face of the destruction of all electronically stored information, but having our imaginations intact is certainly reassuring.  The title text cites the Tears in rain soliloquy, the dying words of the replicant and main antagonist Roy Batty (played by Rutger Hauer) in the 1982 film Blade Runner, implying that the 64KiB HeartBleed buffer is so complete it includes memories from replicant brains. This is ironic as in the soliloquy, Roy Batty stated ""All those moments will be lost in time"".  The title text also suggests to patch OpenSSL oneself, which might refer to the patched version of OpenSSL by Debian, which turned out to be vulnerable in 2008, and was the topic of 424: Security Holes.  In addition to the below, see xkcd's explanation in the next comic.  Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor to SSL, is a protocol that provides end-to-end encryption for data transmitted over the internet, and is described in RFC 5246. The Heartbeat extension to TLS introduced in 2012 (described in RFC 6520) provides a protocol for keeping an encrypted TLS session alive (preventing inactivity timeouts), so you do not have to do a costly TLS handshake with the server for subsequent transfer of information.  The Heartbeat protocol involves the client sending a packet with an arbitrary payload (often a random 16 to 32 byte number) that the server periodically sends back to the client to tell the client that the TLS session is still alive. When the client sends the packet to a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, the OpenSSL server reads a payload_size from the header sent by the client. This is a 2-byte number (0 to 0xffff=65535) that is supposed to describe the size of the payload. The OpenSSL library writes the payload to memory, but it does not check that the size of the payload written to memory matches the payload_size taken from the client's header. When the vulnerable server sends back the Heartbeat KeepAlive response to the client, it will readout payload_size number of bytes and send them back to the client. If you send a payload that is actually 16 bytes, but claims it is 0xffff bytes you will read the next 64KiB of memory of the vulnerable process starting from wherever the payload was written. An attacker can repeat this attack many times and can do this attack early in the TLS handshake, so the attack will not in any way be logged unless they are logging every incoming packet which is not typical and would result in many passwords being logged. As private keys often have an identifiable format, it is often possible for an attacker to find the private TLS key, so if they eavesdrop on network traffic they can decrypt and/or alter it.  For more detailed information see: 1, 2, 3.  It is worth noting that modern operating systems use a virtual memory abstraction above physical memory. This means every process can only access memory assigned to it, so it would be impossible for a vulnerable web server to read memory assigned to another process (like a text editor that has erotic fan fiction stored to memory) on the same computer. For more info, see: 4.  It also should be noted that this heartbleed bug only affects certain versions of OpenSSL, and does not affect other TLS/SSL implementations, or OpenSSH which does not even use the TLS protocol, but uses the SSH-2 protocol (described in RFC 4251). SSH is typically used for remote logins on unix and linux computers.  Vulnerable sysadmins need to update to a patched version of OpenSSL or one with the Heartbeats disabled. Unless their TLS keys were protected by hardware, they probably also need to revoke their old TLS keys, and generate new TLS keys.  Users of vulnerable systems should change their passwords after the sysadmins have revoked their old key and issued new ones (as their passwords may have been compromised). Users can check whether a given website is vulnerable via a Heartbleed test also available as open source. The Lastpass heartbleed diagnostic also indicates whether the signature on the TLS key predates the publication of the heartbleed vulnerability.  The vulnerable commit was introduced Dec 31st, 2011 by Robin Seggelmann, the first co-author of the heartbeats RFC, and went live when OpenSSL version 1.0.1 was released on 2012-03-14 and the vulnerability was widely announced 2014-04-07.","Megan: Heartbleed must be the worst web security lapse ever. Cueball: Worst so far. Give us time.  Megan: I mean, this bug isn't just broken encryption. Megan: It lets website visitors make a server dispense random memory contents.  Megan: It's not just keys. It's traffic data. Emails. Passwords. Erotic fanfiction. Cueball: Is everything compromised?  Megan: Well, the attack is limited to data stored in computer memory. Cueball: So paper is safe. And clay tablets. Megan: Our imaginations, too. Cueball: See, we'll be fine."
1354: Heartbleed Explanation,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1354:_Heartbleed_Explanation,computers,"Are you still there, server? It's me, Margaret.","The Heartbleed bug has received a lot of news coverage recently and was also the topic of the previous comic 1353: Heartbleed. This comic explains how the bug may have been discovered and can be exploited to reveal a server's memory contents.   A Megan-like character named Margaret (or ""Meg"") sends heartbeat requests to the server, the server responds to the heartbeat request by returning the contents of the body of the request up to the number of letters requested. The first two requests are well formed, requesting exactly the number of characters in the request body. The server's memory is showing Meg's request with many other requests going on at the same time.  Meg then ponders this and tries to another request asking for ""HAT"" but requests that it be 500 letters long instead of only 3; the server —not checking it or simply unaware that 500 letters is larger than the request body— returns ""HAT"" plus 497 letters that happened to be next to the word ""HAT"" in its memory (more will follow than are shown in the server's speak bubble as there are only 251 letters/symbols in the shown reply). Included are many sensitive bits of information, including a master key and user passwords. One of the passwords shown is ""CoHoBaSt"", a reference to 936: Password Strength, which suggests using ""correct horse battery staple"" as a password.  Often popular explanations of security bugs require the issue to be simplified a lot and to leave out a lot of details. In this case Randall didn't have to do much simplifying; the bug is actually that simple. Also, it should be noted that any client which can connect to the server typically can exploit this bug in the underlying OpenSSL software — the use of the term ""User Meg"" does not imply that Meg had to authenticate first.  Although Randall shows Meg recording the data by hand, on paper, it is more likely that a person exploiting the bug would have a computer record the data, perhaps on its hard drive or on a flash drive.  The title text is a reference to Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret., a novel by Judy Blume, and plays off of the ""server, are you still there?"" line in every panel where she did start a request. The novel is the theme of another comic 1544: Margaret too. Meg can be a nickname for Margaret as well as Megan who Margret resembles.","[Caption above the panels:] How the Heartbleed Bug works:  [Meg, a girl with more curly hair than Megan, stands to the left in a panel.

1367: Installing,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1367:_Installing,computers,"But still, my scheme for creating and saving user config files and data locally to preserve them across reinstalls might be useful for--wait, that's cookies.","This comic refers to the kind of ""inventions"" which seem new from the point of view of a smartphone (handheld computer) user, but have already been around for a long time on desktop or laptop/notebook computers.  Cueball has a clever idea to skip the installing of applications on mobile phones: he would host the applications online instead, and provide links to the servers. The apps wouldn't stay on the phone all the time; instead the phone would download each app again every time the user wanted to run it.  However, web pages and web applications already work like this. Clicking a link will make the browser download a web page and render HTML code and JavaScript that it links to.  The page usually isn't saved long-term on the user's computer; instead the browser downloads it again when needed. HTML5 does however offer the option of caching web application files locally so it can remain operational when there is no network connection.  In the title text, Cueball's idea for local application storage already exists in the HTTP protocol as cookies. The more flexible web storage was originally part of the HTML5 specification, but it's now in a separate specification.  Native phone applications and web applications are not completely interchangeable. Web applications may not allow access to more advanced or platform-specific resources. Projects like Apache Cordova make these resources available to web applications by creating a native application wrapper for the web application.","[Cueball and Megan are standing next to each other.] Cueball: Installing things has gotten so fast and painless. Cueball: Why not skip it entirely, and make a phone that has every app ""installed"" already and just downloads and runs them on the fly?  I felt pretty clever until I realized I'd invented webpages."
1401: New,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1401:_New,computers,The nice thing about headcannnons is that it's really easy to get other people to believe in them.,"This strip uses a play on the homophonic relationship between ""canon"", the literary term, and ""cannon"", a projectile weapon. The word headcannon is a compound of ""head"" and ""cannon"".  In this strip, Black Hat tells Cueball that he has a ""new headcannon"". Cueball, thinking Black Hat means ""headcanon"" (an unjustified belief or theory about a fictional universe), inquires what Black Hat's new idea is. Instead of the expected idea or theory, Black Hat removes his hat to reveal a tiny cannon on his head which blows away Cueball and his computer desk.  While headcanon may often be ignored or dismissed as a personal theory, a headcannon would be far harder to ignore, as it is a physical object which has a notable (and in this case violent) impact on the real world.   In the title text Randall makes the spellings of these two words indistinguishable by using three consecutive ""n""s to spell ""headcannnon"". Therefore, the title text is deliberately vague. It could be interpreted that it is easy to convince people that you have a cannon on your head, that it is easy to make people believe in a self invented headcanons, or both. Since you are choosing your own interpretation of this title text, the joke is that you are creating your own headcanon.  This comic also shows Cueball being once again distracted from his work in a manner similar to 1388: Subduction License.  In terms of a given literary series, ""canon"" describes a set of works that are collectively recognized by the community as having authenticity. Generally, works created or endorsed by the original author(s) are considered canonical. Not all original content is considered canon and not all canon is original content.  Sometimes creators will rewrite the canon (called a retcon) and make things that were previously canonical non-canonical. For example, the origins of a character may be rewritten, thus invalidating the portions of the works that speak to the old origins. Other times creators will incorporate non-original content and therefore incorporate the canon of these borrowed works.  A headcanon as the name implies is a form of canon that only exists in one's mind. More specifically, a headcanon is created when a consumer watching or reading the material develops their own ideas about a fictional universe that are not actually part of the canon, perhaps developing their own backstories or experiences for characters. Some frequent examples of headcanon include relationships between characters, abilities, events following the conclusion of the work, etc. which the author or creator has not explained or included. For example, a consumer may ""read between the lines"" and assume that there was a previous romantic relationship between two characters where no conclusive evidence actually exists of one. Some fans who come up with particularly interesting or convincing headcanons may decide to share them with others in hopes that their idea spreads.","[Black Hat walks in.] Black Hat: New headcannon:  [Cueball is sitting at his desk, using his computer.] Cueball: Yeah?  [Black Hat lifts his hat, revealing his ""headcannon"": a tiny cannon on the top of his head. The headcannon fires and blows up Cueball's desk, the explosion throwing Cueball backwards.] Headcannon: BOOM Cueball: Augh!"
1406: Universal Converter Box,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1406:_Universal_Converter_Box,computers,"Comes with a 50-lb sack of gender changers, and also an add-on device with a voltage selector and a zillion circular center pin DC adapter tips so you can power any of those devices from the 90s.","Converter boxes are used to connect two or more devices together which otherwise couldn't be, due to differently shaped plugs, different voltages, or different protocols of communication.  Converter boxes or converter cables are commonly found for several of the plugs at the top of the list - such as from USB to micro-USB. As this is supposed to be a Universal Converter Box, there are many connections.  The humour from this comic comes from the sheer number of different standards that all claim to be the universal way to connect two devices, in their target market, as well as the progressively ridiculous conversions that this box is capable of doing, for example, converting audio from a 1/8 inch / 3.5 mm headphone jack, into a variety of fuel suitable for running your car.  A connector is capable of making a connection to another connector only if the connectors are of the same style and the opposite gender (""male"" connector is plug, ""female"" connector is socket), except for rare ""genderless"" connectors, such as the token ring mentioned above. Gender changers are devices with two connectors of the same gender. The ""circular center pin DC adapter tips"" in the title text are barrel jack power plugs. There are a large number of these style connectors, and many of these devices look the same, leading to frustration.  The plugs are numbered from top to bottom and incremented for every wire that comes directly out of the converter box.  For some interfaces, such as USB, the female side is standard to the device while the male side is standard to the cable. For other interfaces, such as the RS-232 serial port, the conventions vary or there is no convention.  The ""universal"" connector here doesn't support the proper RS-232, with the closest surrogate available being RJ-11. The other nearest analog would be the parallel port, available in Centronix and D-25-pin connectors.  The SCSI connectors have been available as the ""internal"" connectors (see the ""break-away"" above) of 2 different widths, Centronix, 2 widths of the mini-D connectors with the easily bendable pins, 3 widths of the more reliable pin-less mini-connectors, and high-speed serial.  Not only is there gender and connector type, but there are also different standards on what data/power is connected on each pin of the connector. Building a working connection often involved getting 3 or 4 adapters connected in a sequence to produce the right connector, gender and pin-out.  Barrel jack power plugs were developed in the 1980s. The ""barrel"" has an inner diameter an outer diameter, and different style pins.  A D-shell is a trapezoidal metal skirt that protects the pins, prevents the connector from being plugged in the wrong way, and makes the physical connection more secure.  A VGA was developed in 1987, and with new versions being developed since then.  DVI can be configured to support multiple modes such as DVI-D (digital only), DVI-A (analog only), or DVI-I (digital and analog).  HDMI has slowly been replacing DVI and VGA ports on newer devices due to the simplicity and the smaller footprint and overall dimensions.  Thunderbolt is far faster than almost any  connector on the market for transferring data. However, the limited adoption by manufacturers, the higher costs of the hardware, and the security concerns inherent to the interface have limited the adoption by consumers.  Because Firewire is designed to allow backplane access and direct memory access (DMA) to devices, there are additional conversion and security issues with it.  The phone connector diameter of 1/8"" is only an approximation using Imperial units. The standard actually specifies a size in the Metric system of 3.5 mm. The video plug has 3 contacts (Tip, Ring and Sleeve) and the audio has 4 contacts (Tip, Ring, Ring and Sleeve).  While no longer common in homes or offices, parallel connections are still used in some embedded systems.  Airline pneumatic tube audio was used by in-flight entertainment systems manufactured from 1963 until 1979.  Note that while AC adapters are necessary—and widely available—to suit sockets in other countries, this ""universal"" converter does not feature any other AC power plugs, but this could be accommodated using adapters.  Cheater plugs exist to connect a NEMA grounding-type plug (three prongs) to a NEMA non-grounding receptacle (two slots), but the use of such an adapter can be hazardous if the grounding tab is not connected to electrical ground. A safer alternative is to replace the outlet with a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) breaker outlet.  The computer media drive connectors are unlike the motherboard-powering connectors from the Power Supply Unit of a PC, which may involve multiple additional 4, 6 and 8-pin 'breakout' supply cables that have this feature and specially 'keyed' pin-sheaths as well to allow forward/backward compatibility between various versions of PSU and motherboard that could be used (and power-hungry GPUs of various kinds, as well).  Note that some embedded systems such as cash registers actually do use larger USB connectors to include 12V and/or 24V power connections. These are not, however, called ""macro-USB"", and are not as large.  Other countries often use RJ11-ended cables with locally-specific adapter-ends, e.g. the BS 6312 in Britain. Broadband microfilters may make use of this difference by splitting a relevant telephone plug standard into the local non-RJ11 style of telephone plug for an ""audio-only"" pass-through socket and an RJ11 for the router/modem to be cabled up to for the abstracted ""data-only"" signal — making an adapter for this will be nearly impossible.  There are two common systems for showing octane numbers on fuel pumps; the numbers shown (87, 91, 93) most closely map to Anti-Knock Index values which is used for the North American market and a number of other countries, the other system used in the rest of the world is Research Octane Number. In the AKI system; 87 octane (91 RON) is regular US, 91 octane (95 RON) is regular European, 93 octane (98 RON) is premium European, and in US both 91 and 93 are considered premium/super depending on the regulations of a particular state. Some states, such as California, forbid the sale of the gasoline above 91 octane. Only very rarely could both 91 and 93 be found at the same gas station. The typical line-up is ""regular"" (87), ""plus"" (89), and ""premium""/""super"" (depending on the state and on the fuel brand, 91, 92 or 93 octane). A standard diesel nozzle (24mm) is slightly larger diameter than a standard petrol nozzle (21mm) so you cannot tank diesel into a petrol car but if this nozzle has the petrol nozzle diameter you are still able to tank with it into some diesel cars. Some manufacturers such as Volkswagen fit a misfueling guard and fuel filler neck cap or have redesigned the fuel filler to prevent a petrol nozzle being used in a diesel car.  Since the release of this comic, Apple has created a magnetic charging cable for its Apple Watch, which functions in the same manner as the current MagSafe 1 & 2 by using a magnet to connect to the device. This new charger looks identical to the fictional MagSafe 3 in the comic.","[Universal converter box with wires to connectors:] VGA DVI HDMI Thunderbolt Firewire Component [sharing connectors with Component:] RCA 1/8"" Audio 1/8"" Video Parallel Port S-Video Airline Pneumatic Tube Audio PS/2/3/4 120V AC [pointing to ground pin:] Removable  Floppy/IDE/2.5""/SCSI [pointing to sections in IDC connector:] Break here  USB USB (weird other end) Mini-USB Micro USB Macro USB F Connector Fiber RJ11 Ethernet Token Ring MagSafe MagSafe 2 MagSafe 3 MagSafe 4 Bluetooth Dongle SCART String (fits most cans) [Fuel nozzle with selector for:] 87/91/93/Diesel"
1411: Loop,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1411:_Loop,computers,"Ugh, today's kids are forgetting the old-fashioned art of absentmindedly reading the same half-page of a book over and over and then letting your attention wander and picking up another book.","Cueball is seen at his desk in front of four devices. He has clearly run out of things to do, or is looking for an excuse to procrastinate. A flowchart describes the process by which he scans the whole environment for something to do, which everyone can relate to.  The comic uses electronics likely because they are the common time killer these days, and are most likely to contain fresh, tantalizing entertainment. News sites can be viewed as a good source of yet-to-be-seen content. Yet the search yields no interesting content, or the results don't garner enough attention, thus the blank stares and moving on to next device in line. Cueball has four devices, so he can begin with the PC and move through the loop three times - first to laptop, then tablet and finally to smartphone.  The title text notes that this also happened before there were electronic devices like today, assuming most entertainment came from books. The point made is that, while the Internet and modern electronic devices are often blamed for jeopardizing the minds of adolescents, the attention span of ""the kids"" is not worse than it ever was, neither in the context of low-tech nor high-tech media. Kids focus on some things for a long time, but they do change this focus often very abruptly. But nevertheless there are still many kids reading books today until the end.  The title text could also be considered to imply another type of loop in which various generations experience the same situations under different circumstances (i.e., history repeating itself). In this case, the new generation experiences the attention lapse loop with electronics, whereas the previous generation experienced this same loop with books. There may also be a commentary present on the shorter attention span of the current generation as opposed to the previous one in that there is an obvious terminus to the electronics loop while the book loop could extend nearly indefinitely.","[Cueball sits at a desk, accompanied by a desktop computer and a laptop open in front of it.

1439: Rack Unit,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1439:_Rack_Unit,computers,There's also nothing in the TOSes that says you can't let a dog play baseball in the server room!,"Black Hat announces to Megan that 19-inch racks for datacenter servers and Langstroth hive frames are both 19 inches wide (482.6 mm), with similar spacing between each slot. Black Hat is motivated by this knowledge to break into a Google datacenter and fill server racks with beehives. When Megan sarcastically consoles Black Hat for the loss of his hives, he declares that he'll find other datacenters to install hives in.  The pitch (or distance between repeating items) of 19 inch rack server hardware is measured in rack units (U), and is standardized at 1.75"" (44.45 mm). Langstroth frames are typically mounted at a pitch of 1.5"" (38.1 mm), and as a result would fit relatively well with a server cabinet. In contrast to the horizontal orientation of the modules in a server rack, honeycomb frames are designed to hang vertically, so the cells can hold nectar without it dripping out. How Black Hat was able to re-orient the racks to suit the needs of honey production remains a mystery.  Some datacenters provide colocation services where customers may install a server at a central location with better bandwidth and power reliability than a customer could provide on their own. Noticing that typical colocation terms of service (TOS) agreements don't specifically rule out the installation of beehives, Black Hat suggests he can enter a legal contract allowing him to install beehives at a data center without being kicked out.  As with many types of terms of service contracts, such as privacy agreements, a standard boilerplate wording is used amongst many contractors. Megan comments that a term forbidding the installation of beehives will quickly become a standard term in colocation agreements. The comic thus might be making fun of boilerplate legal agreements, which are commonly signed without being read, suggesting that the legal wording is so long and detailed that anything not specifically prohibited must be allowed.  The alt-text is a reference to the film Air Bud. The original quote is ""Ain't no rules says a dog can't play basketball.""","[Megan and Black Hat are talking, Megan is sitting at a computer.] Black Hat: I've discovered something. Megan: Oh?

1479: Troubleshooting,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1479:_Troubleshooting,computers,"Oh, you're using their Chrome APP, not their Chrome EXTENSION. They're very similar but one handles window creation differently. is a thing I hope I can stop saying soon.","This comic revolves around the complexity of modern software and its sometimes low quality. Many problems that users experience are not obvious or straightforward, and methods for correcting the root cause of the problem requires invoking unrelated actions that happen to cause a desired side-effect. Knowing the non-obvious cause, the desired side effect, and how to trigger the unrelated feature that causes it requires memorization of lots of ""stupid computer knowledge"" rather than general principles and logical investigation of the software.  One particular example of an illogical fix to a software problem is depicted in the comic. Here, Cueball is trying to help Hairy resolve the problem of a program that is not responding to any mouse clicks. Cueball surmises that this is not due to abnormal behavior of the software (such as freezing), but rather because either the user or the software itself has opened a modal dialog window outside of the main screen area, where it can not be seen. Modal dialog windows block access to the rest of the application, by seizing the sole focus of the user input. They are valid GUI tools and are used when the software needs the user's input before it can proceed further. However, opening such a window and placing it outside of the visible screen area (""off-screen"") will make the window both inaccessible and invisible to the user, precluding them from closing it and re-gaining access to the software.  One non-obvious way to repair such a problem is to switch the screen resolution; this in itself does not fix the problem, but the resolution switch also forces the operating system to redraw all windows on the desktop, and some operating systems will also validate the coordinates of all windows and adjust these coordinates so that the windows do not end up in off-screen area. In this scenario, it is used as a side-effect to fix the problem, because operating systems rarely provide other, more obvious ways to bring off-screen windows back to the visible area.  By saying ""Why is that even possible?"", Hairy is quite correct in pointing out that the best way to address this problem at its root would be for the operating system developers to prevent the creation of windows off-screen, preemptively avoiding a whole class of window management problems before they can occur. For example, such mechanisms could validate coordinates during window creation, thus making sure that the dialog window would always be accessible and visible. Such a mechanism exists on OS X, but not on Windows, which the majority of computers are running at the time of this comic's release.  In general, one can sort the possible solutions to the problem being discussed in the following order of preference, from best to worst:  The title text refers to the fact that two different and unrelated software packages can have confusingly similar names, even if the usage and features of those two packages can vary wildly, and knowing the implications of using one instead of the other is a case of ""stupid computer knowledge"". Knowing the difference between a Chrome app, a cell phone app-style application, delivered from the Chrome web store, designed to be run in the Chrome browser, and a Chrome extension, a browser extension installed into the Chrome browser, delivered from the Chrome web store, designed to modify the behavior of the browser itself, is a subtle distinction that may not be immediately apparent to users who might just have the name of the software they are looking for. Google Hangouts is an example of a product that exists as both a Chrome app and a Chrome extension, whose windows are more similar to each other than to normal Chrome browser windows; and confusingly, it's possible to be signed into one account with the app and another with the extension, especially when your employer or school uses Apps for Business/Education.  In many cases, Randall (or Cueball, his avatar) loves to help people using his specific knowledge (see 208: Regular Expressions). But when the trick is ""stupid"", he would prefer the programmers to fix the problem definitively so he never has to rely on this trick anymore.","[Hairy sitting at a desk with laptop, with Cueball standing behind him.] Hairy: Wait, why can't I click anywhere? Cueball: I don't... Ugh, It opened a dialog box offscreen. Hairy: Why is that even possible? Cueball: It really shouldn't be. But you can fix it by changing your screen resolution to trigger a window cleanup. Hairy: Seriously? Cueball: I know, I know...  To be honest, I can't wait for the day when all my stupid computer knowledge becomes obsolete."
1495: Hard Reboot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1495:_Hard_Reboot,computers,"Googling inevitably reveals that my problem is caused by a known bug triggered by doing [the exact combination of things I want to do]. I can fix it, or wait a few years until I don't want that combination of things anymore, using the kitchen timer until then.","This comic is about using a simple and unrelated trick to work around a problem, instead of spending a long time solving the cause of the problem.  Swap space is an area of a computer's hard drive reserved for use when the computer runs out of RAM. Ideally, RAM + SWAP >= MAX, where MAX is the amount of memory the computer will ever try to use at the same time. However, some (broken) programs may keep requesting memory from the system until computer runs out of resources (a memory leak), or the system may be misconfigured to run more and more programs simultaneously. Rebooting the computer will empty the RAM and swap space so resources can be reallocated, but this only temporarily alleviates the underlying issue. Determining the root cause of the problem is often nontrivial.  It would take Randall up to 10 hours to figure out why the server is running out of swap space and fix the problem. Alternatively, Randall could just take 5 minutes and plug the server into a light timer. This attitude to problem solving is in contrast to the attitude shown in 974: The General Problem.  Timers like the one in the comic typically have four switches or notches per hour, so using the timer would replace an unpredictable and indefinite loss of service with a regular 15 minute downtime event once a day. Also, it can be scheduled during, say, the middle of the night when most users are sleeping to minimize disruption.  The correct method of scheduling a regular reboot would be using a cron task, but perhaps the server is ""crashing"" in such a dramatic manner that cron, or shutdown, or init stops working. The comic title alludes to this, in that a ""hard"" reboot scheduled with an analog timer is more guaranteed to work than a ""soft"" one scheduled with cron.  If a memory leak is not present, the problem might be fixable by simply increasing swap space; however, if there is a more complex underlying issue, this is the first step along the path of 10 hours of troubleshooting. As a general stereotype, the type of person who has a home server is probably also the kind of person who would start by 'just' increasing the swap size, and before they know it has spent 10 hours completely engrossed in the challenge of fixing the problem. (See 349: Success)  The subtitle reads ""Why everything I have is broken"". This indicates that Randall frequently finds himself doing non-standard workarounds that temporarily solve a problem but may ultimately damage the system to the point of becoming nonfunctional. Indeed, a kitchen/light timer used to cut power to a server overnight may affect the server's performance if it is in the middle of a process when the reboot happens. Alternatively, this can be interpreted to mean that everything Randall has is broken and held together by metaphorical duct tape.  The title text's first sentence reveals that Randall is aware that looking further for a fix is futile: The problem is caused by a bug which has already been analyzed and is known to be triggered by using the system in the very way Randall is using it. He may get around the bug by changing what the system does, but then it would not provide the services he needs anymore. It may also refer to bug trackers, where someone found out and posted what causes the issue, but the bug is marked as ""Unresolved,"" ""Waiting,"" or ""Will not fix.""  It is not clear why the title text refers to a kitchen timer while the comic itself refers to a light timer. It might be a small error, or it might be that Randall just considers these to be two synonymous terms. Typically, however, a kitchen timer refers to an alarm that will go off, rather than a timer that cuts power to a device like a light timer.  Google image search suggests that contemporary light timers mostly have grounded three-prong plugs, and the sort of duct-tape hacker who would schedule a daily reboot with a light timer probably wouldn't worry about grounding anyway.  The title text's second sentence refers to the fact that operating system bugs take a long time to be solved, hence the solution of ""wait[ing] a few years until I don't want that combination of things anymore."" Humor in that sentence is found in the fact that readers will anticipate ""wait a few years until..."" would be followed by ""the bug is fixed"", however, Randall is indicating that usually his needs change before the bugs get fixed, or that he has very low confidence in that the bug will be fixed in time, if ever. This play on expectations is a common comedic trope.",[Inside a frame there are two pictures. To the left there is a section of a computer screen with white text on a black background.

1506: xkcloud,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1506:_xkcloud,computers,,"In this interactive April Fools' Day comic Cueball, presumably representing Randall, admits to the readers he built a flimsy cloud services company using spare computers and parts. Included in the cloud hardware are (from left to right) a Macintosh Classic, several old laptops, an Alienware tower, a Nintendo VirtualBoy, an old desktop with the cover off, and an Atari Pong Console. He named the company after xkcd, xkcloud being a portmanteau of ""xkcd"" and ""cloud"", here pronounced XK-cloud. The portmanteau incidentally still contains all four xkcd letters in the correct order: xkcLOUd. After providing his services to various (very big) companies (Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr), that are very concerned with securing the users data, his setup failed (some portions may even have caught fire? He is not sure). This has caused him to lose the data he was required to preserve as part of his service. He thus requests the readers help to make up and re-imagine the lost data by pressing the large red button at the bottom of the comic. Preferably before Facebook & Co notice we lost it. If the you take him up on his request and pushes the button you will be taken to a ""survey"" where you will get the chance to help by either trying to combine a posted picture with its lost text or, vice versa, by trying to combine a posted text with its lost picture. In either case you get a selection of texts/pictures to choose from but can also choose to write your own text or even draw the picture. After doing this you get to see this combination in the news feed together with several other posts (which other people have helped combine from other lost data). And then you can continue helping as long as you like. The content of the ""surveys"" appear to come from reader submissions, and are different upon every click. This is thus both an interactive and a dynamic comic with only the first picture shown on top of this page. By inviting the xkcd readers to add content that will be displayed in the comic later, the result of all the interactions leads to the generation of crowd-sourced content. It was not immediately clear if the reader-created drawings or captions are, in fact, being cycled into the surveys and feeds, or if the displayed items were all created by Randall and the reader-created content is simply discarded. With the huge amount of different comments and drawings there already appeared on the first day, and since especially the drawings looks like they are created in the simple paint app. (i.e. not by Randall), there can be no doubt that most of the content are created by the users. However he must have made some pictures to get it all started, and at least one of these can be seen here. This comic resembles last years April Fools' comic 1350: Lorenz where user input also generated a very complex crowd-sourced comic. In both comics it was possible to create a permalink to save a given version of the comic to share with others. An earlier comic that was also related to problems with cloud computing 908: The Cloud.

1508: Operating Systems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1508:_Operating_Systems,computers,"One of the survivors, poking around in the ruins with the point of a spear, uncovers a singed photo of Richard Stallman. They stare in silence. ""This,"" one of them finally says, ""This is a man who BELIEVED in something.""","In this comic, Randall gives an overview of past, present and (speculatively) future of the operating systems running in his house at any given time. Notably, because Randall is fascinated by technology, he has had more than one OS running in his household since the mid '90's. The timeline tracks how Operating Systems have come and gone over the years, and the gradual shift from desktop Operating Systems to mobile can be observed. Beyond the present day, we see some of Randall's humorous predictions as to which technologies and companies will dominate the Operating System landscape in the future.  It may be that the OS that is closest to the time-line is also the one he mainly uses during these extended periods.  Previous and current systems:  His predictions for the future include:  The title text refers to Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software movement and the GNU and Hurd projects. A survivor of the fire that ended the human civilization has uncovered a slightly burned (singed) picture of him. Those gathered can see, either directly from the picture or because they already know of Stallman, that this was a man that really believed in something. In this case it was free software. Inspired by his image, they rebuild their lost civilization and finish Hurd development.  The GNU/Hurd reference might also be a pun, as in a ""herd"" of Gnus ""running"" in his living room, as wild animals reclaim the Earth after the end of human civilization.  GNU is a collection of free software utilities, particularly the system utilities used with the Linux Kernel to form the Linux operating system (often called GNU/Linux by those who wish to emphasize the contribution of the GNU project). Hurd is an operating system kernel designed as part of GNU project that could be used in place of the Linux kernel to produce a complete GNU operating system. Hurd has a microkernel architecture, which has many perceived advantages over Linux's monolithic kernel, and is thought by many to be technically superior, despite its low adoption rate compared to the Linux kernel.  Randall has made several comics about free software and also about Stallman. See this list of comics featuring Richard Stallman. Most of these are also about free software in some form.","[At the top of the panel:] Operating Systems running in my house   [At the bottom there is time-line that runs from 1990 to 2066.

1513: Code Quality,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1513:_Code_Quality,computers,I honestly didn't think you could even USE emoji in variable names. Or that there were so many different crying ones.,"This comic is the first in the Code Quality series, and is about the apprehension of asking for help from an expert who is a friend. Often we fear that we will be judged and they will think less of us, which is what occurs in this comic.  Ponytail is about to look at some source code Cueball has written, and he is warning her that he is self-taught so his code probably won't be written the way she is used to.  In spite of Ponytail's initial (polite) optimism, she comments in three increasingly harsh similes (and a fourth in the title text). The comic was later followed in 1695: Code Quality 2 and 1833: Code Quality 3, where Cueball is never shown on screen but only replies off-screen to four more even harsher comments (plus the title text ones), taking the total of her abusive comments up to 14!  First, she suggests that reading his code is like being in a house built by a child, using a small axe to put together what he thought was a house based on a picture. She is saying that the code shows a lack of command of the language being programmed. This is like the common expression ""if the only tool you have is a hammer, you'll treat everything as if it were a nail"". New programmers make use the same techniques repeatedly, making them fit for situations that they are not intended for.  Second, she suggests that it looks like a salad recipe, written by a corporate lawyer on a phone with autocorrect that only corrected things to formulas from Microsoft Excel. She is saying that the code is verbose and the corrections that were done are illogical. This presumably relates to the developer not being an expert in their craft, and fixing the problems as they come up instead of reexamining the problem and solving it in a better way.  Third, she describes it as a transcript of a couple arguing at IKEA, which was then randomly edited until the computer compiled it with no errors. She is saying that the intent of the code is unclear due to the seemingly random use of the language. This is very similar to an infinite amount of monkeys bashing away on typewriters for an infinite amount of time eventually producing the complete works of Shakespeare. (A couple's argument may be even less coherent at Ikea than at the average store, since Ikea products have idiosyncratic names that are difficult to pronounce or transcribe for anyone who doesn't speak Swedish.) This might happen if the code was written so bad that it does not compile, and people edited the code until it compiles so they can see what the code accomplishes. That Cueball's code is in this bad a shape indicates he really hasn't learned the programming language; he just happens to have a program that works in some shape or fashion.   Finally, Cueball makes the rather weak assurance that he will read ""a style guide"", which articulates the intended use of the language. It seems clear from Ponytail's commentary that his code quality would benefit from far more training in computer programming.  The title text refers to emoji. Ponytail's comment implies that some of Cueball's variables contained emoji, perhaps in an effort to capture the emotional content of the arguments which show through the requirements document. Emoji has become a recurrent theme on xkcd, but this may have been the first comic to use them for a pun.  Many crying-face emoji are possible if variables can include full Unicode (e.g., 😢,😭,😂,😪,😥,😰,😿,😹). In some programming languages it would be impossible to use them in variable names, as the symbols would break the language's syntax rules. Exceptions to this include Go, Swift and Perl ([1]), but most languages with compilers that support Unicode characters can include this kind of emoji, even for languages that predate Unicode like C++ and Lisp  In any event, Cueball's code may best be represented by a bunch of people crying, as that is the only proper response to it.  Although few programming languages require a perfectly rigid style, so long as the code is syntactically accurate, most programmers follow some sort of style to make the code easier to read. This includes indenting lines to show levels and using descriptive variable identifiers with special capitalization, (e.g., camelCase, capitalizing each word except for the first in a sentence, or snake_case, separating lowercase words with underscores).","[Cueball showing Ponytail his laptop.] Cueball: Keep in mind that I'm self-taught, so my code may be a little messy. Ponytail: Lemme see - I'm sure it's fine.  [Ponytail sits at desk, Cueball stand behind her.] Ponytail: ...Wow. This is like being in a house built by a child using nothing but a hatchet and a picture of a house.  [Ponytail sits at desk, Cueball stand behind her.] Ponytail: It's like a salad recipe written by a corporate lawyer using a phone autocorrect that only knew Excel formulas.  [Ponytail sits at desk, Cueball stand behind her.] Ponytail: It's like someone took a transcript of a couple arguing at IKEA and made random edits until it compiled without errors. Cueball: Okay, I'll read a style guide."
1570: Engineer Syllogism,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1570:_Engineer_Syllogism,computers,"The less common, even worse outcome: ""3: [everyone in the financial system] WOW, where did all my money just go?""","A syllogism is a logical argument where two or more propositions lead to a conclusion through deductive reasoning. For example, one of the best-known syllogisms is:  In this comic, Cueball is an engineer who is attempting to make the following syllogism:  Since most engineers are purportedly good at math, proposition 1 seems to be true. It is also loosely true that the stock market is made of numbers, but only in the sense that every system can be given a post-hoc numeric characterization; the dynamics of the stock market are primarily human-driven. In this comic Cueball thinks that his skill at math will help him beat the stock market. Little does he know that the system can be unpredictable, so he ends up losing money as the financial instrument he's invested in loses value. This is due to the financial markets being largely controlled by humans making emotional decisions and not some calculable reason or logic. The fact that humans make emotional decisions is alluded to in the title text of 592: Drama.  Even if the propositions ""I am good at understanding numbers"" and ""The stock market is made of numbers"" were true in Cueball's interpretation, Cueball would still be wrong to conclude that ""I am good at understanding the stock market"": this would be a fallacy of the undistributed middle (with the first premise being more accurately stated as ""I'm good at understanding things made of numbers"") and a fallacy of composition (with the implicit third premise ""if I'm good at understanding the components of a system, then I'm good at understanding the system""). The problem is that proposition 1 seems to say ""I am good at understanding all math"". However, the ""all"" is not present, so Cueball may not necessarily understand the math underlying the stock market.  This comic is also related to the 1998 movie Pi where the main character repeats to himself several times his assumptions that the world is all numbers, and thus he, a great mathematician, should be able to predict the stock market, which is all numbers. He believes that maybe his work on patterns in pi will provide some deeper insight into the patterns in the stock market, a project that drove his mentor crazy and may in fact be making his computer self-aware.   The title text talks of the scenario where everyone makes the fallacy of Cueball and this leads to a much worse global situation - i.e. a stock market crash.  The release date of this comic makes it highly likely that it refers at least in part to the 2015 Chinese stock market crash which largely affected most other world financial markets, particularly during the week of August 24–28, during which this comic was published.  Two, less likely, interpretations of the title text has been suggested:","[An white frame with text inside an underbrace and an overbrace.] An engineer syllogism.  [Cueball is at his desk in front of his computer, with his hands on his knees, thinking.] Cueball, thinking: 1: I am good at understanding numbers.  [Cueball takes one hand to his chin, still thinking.] Cueball, thinking: 2: The stock market is made of numbers.  [Cueball lifts both arms from his legs, still thinking.] Cueball, thinking: 3: Therefore I-- Wow, where did all my money just go?"
1573: Cyberintelligence,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1573:_Cyberintelligence,computers,"We had gathered that raw information, but had yet to put it all together.","Ponytail presents her company's FY2015 (Fiscal Year for 2015) budget for cyberintelligence. But is then interrupted with a snide remark about the prefix cyber.  This comic illustrates that some organization spends obscene amounts of money on their ""cyberintelligence"" budget, yet all that spending appears not to have informed them that the prefix ""cyber-"" fell out of fashion years ago. That the prefix could annoy experts were already used in the title text of 1084: Server Problem.  The prefix ""cyber"" is derived from ""Cybernetic,"" which comes from the Greek word κυβερνητικός, meaning skilled in steering or governing. Cyberintelligence could also be called cyber spying i.e. spying in the digital world, one of many ""new"" words with the cyber- prefix. Many were invented in the 1980s and 1990s, following the example of ""cyberspace"", popularized by William Gibson in 1982.  If cyberintelligence departments were given names today, they might be called Internet Intelligence, Virtual Intelligence, Data Intelligence or Online Intelligence departments.  This may be due to the fact that government organizations are typically named by middle-aged or senior officials who are generally less likely to be familiar with the current trends in technology language. They are more likely to stick to the words that were used when they first learned about the technology.  The title text continues the joke by implying the organization learned about the demise of ""cyber-"" yet failed to process or analyze that data. It may also be a reference to the previous comic, which was a link to a survey for xkcd readers.  ""Cyberspace"" and ""cybernetics"", illustrated here, are two of the most common words with that prefix (Cyberspace 6 times as prevalent as cybernetics at their peaks). ""Cyberintelligence"" is shown here. Cyberspace was used 4000 times more often, although the more common spelling splitting it in two words ""Cyber intelligence"" was 1.35 times more used than in one word. But even combining these two versions cyberspace is still used more than 1700 times as often.","[Ponytail, pointing at a chart to her left, with text and two curves on a graph, is talking to someone off-screen to the right.] Ponytail: Our overall FY2015 cyberintelligence budget was $8.1 billion- Off-screen voice: -Yet it wasn't enough to pick up on the fact that no one else had used the prefix ""cyber-"" for like a decade? Ponytail: Shut up."
1579: Tech Loops,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1579:_Tech_Loops,computers,"And when I think about it, a lot of ""things I want to do"" are just learning about and discussing new tools for tinkering with the chain.","The comic is about how much time a geek might spend on a computer just to maintain the system itself, rather than actually using it for something relevant. This can in the worst cases go all the way up to the point where maintaining the system becomes the main goal. Often the operating system (OS) needs periodic updates, which might break some apps which in turn need to be updated; apps themselves might need to be updated, which can create all sort of incompatibilities which the geek then needs to spend time fixing.  Most people consider computers as tools to achieve something else — e.g. to surf the web, play games, read news or balance their bank account — and they would rather not have to spend lots of time on maintaining the OS or the computer if they can avoid it.  Here, however, Randall finds he's spending most of the time using his computer just for the sake of maintaining the OS or the hardware on said computer. It's tools for the sake of tooling, rather than tools as helpers to build something else.  A hardware equivalent would be the RepRap Project: get a 3D printer and end up spending all the time printing 3D parts for itself instead of creating something else like toys or art.  An alternative interpretation is how a simple task can get maddeningly tricky because of the inherent complexity of the system. An example of this appears in 949: File Transfer, where the simple task of sending a file from one computer to another gets practically impossible despite having all kinds of cloud tools available, many of them designed to perform much more complex tasks with one simple click. In this view, the box labeled ""things I actually want to use my computer for"" could refer to simple actions like transferring a file and all the rest of the graph are unsuccessful tiring attempts to solve the problem by installing increasingly complex tools which end up not solving the simple problem properly. This is similar to this traditional programming joke.  In the title text Randall realizes that what he really wishes to do it often only to learn about and discussing new tools to improve the chain. So in this way it is for sure only a system to support itself. But on the other hand, then the box with things he actually wishes to use the computer for, is then not disconnected from the rest, but an integral part of it all.  Other comics about the same concept are 349: Success and 763: Workaround.  There are 18 boxes in the chart, but only 12 different texts. 16 of the boxes are interconnected.

1586: Keyboard Problems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1586:_Keyboard_Problems,computers,"In the future, a group of resistance fighters send me back in time with instructions to find the Skynet prototype and try to upgrade it.","This comic parodies how people diagnose and solve computer problems. Cueball and Megan are trying to solve a keyboard issue, but are somewhat incompetent at diagnosing the issue. Cueball in particular blames a broken keyboard on software or a keyboard virus.  In the comic, Cueball complains that some keys in his keyboard don't work. Generally speaking, this could be due either to a software problem (e.g. the keyboard driver not working properly, or some program ignoring keypresses) or to a hardware problem (the keyboard is physically damaged, e.g. because of dirt under the keys).  If the problem is in software, booting from a different operating system (e.g. an external recovery disk) should solve it, as the computer would not be using the faulty software. Conversely, if the problem is in hardware, changing the keyboard should solve the problem as the new keyboard is not physically damaged (and has no dirt under the keys).  However, the problem stays there after booting from an external recovery disk (so it's not a software problem) and it has ""followed Cueball since his last computer"" (i.e. persists after changing to a new laptop with a new keyboard, so it's not a hardware problem). Cueball is reasonably puzzled.  Megan seems to be used to Cueball's computer behaving strangely, and she doesn't even attempt to explain or solve the problem. The only explanation she needs for the problem is that ""it's Cueball's computer"". The characters in this comic are probably the same as in 1084: Server Problem, 1316: Inexplicable, and possibly 349: Success.  Both Cueball and Megan are entirely clueless to the fact that the issue is likely a hardware issue with the keyboards, rather than a virus that spreads between computers. It's possible Cueball uses the computer in a dirty environment with food or dust clogging up all of his keyboards.  It may also be a case of PEBKAC --as in, Cueball pounding the keys in the same way on both keyboards, and breaking the same keys.  Blaming such a broken-key problem on software or a virus is completely absurd.  The last panel is a reference to The Terminator, a 1984 movie often referenced in xkcd. In the movie, the artificial intelligence named Skynet initiates a nuclear war, destroying most of humanity, then it sends killing machines to finish the rest. These include flying drones - Megan suggests that if such robots come to Cueball's vicinity, they will (physically) crash since computers around Cueball can't seem to ever work properly, and so hiding in Cueball's house she should be safe from the robots.  The title text refers to main plot of the movie and its sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day. As Skynet's army is losing the battle against the human Resistance movement, it finds a way to send a humanoid robot T-800 back in time to kill the mother of the Resistance's leader. The Resistance in turn sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect her. In the sequel, the situation repeats with the more advanced T-1000 being the killer and a reprogrammed T-800 being the protector of the child (the future leader). Along the way, they manage to destroy the research lab where Skynet hardware is to be born in the future. The title text suggests an alternative mission into the past, sending Cueball back in time and using his power to cause Skynet to malfunction instead of destroying it physically (as Skynet was created later anyway, despite the destruction of the research lab).","[Cueball sits between two laptops. Megan stands behind him.]  Cueball: Keys on my keyboard keep failing, even when I boot from an external recovery disk. Megan: Sounds like it's hardware, then.  [Cueball moves over to the laptop behind him.]  Cueball: Yeah... except the problem followed me from my last computer. Megan: You have the most bizarre tech issues.  [Cueball picks up the keyboard from the rear computer and plugs it into the one in front of him.]  Cueball: It must be spreading via keyboards. This one won't work with any computer now. Megan: When the robot apocalypse happens, I'm hiding out in your house. Any Skynet drones that come near will develop inexplicable firmware problems and crash."
1597: Git,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1597:_Git,computers,"If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.","Git is a version control system, used to manage the code in many millions of software projects. It is very powerful, and was amongst the first widely adopted tools to use a distributed version control model (the ""beautiful graph theory tree model""), meaning that there is no single central repository of code. Instead, users share code back and forth to synchronise their repositories, and it is up to each project to define processes and procedures for managing the flow of changes into a stable software product.  Although very powerful, the command line of Git is notoriously difficult to learn and master. Dozens of blog posts and websites (see [1], [2]), and even books ([3], [4]) have been written to help users navigate this complexity.   The difficulty of using Git in common situations is belied by the apparent simplicity of its use in tutorial-style situations. Committing and sharing changes is fairly straightforward, for instance, but recovering from situations such as accidental commits, pushes or bad merges is difficult without a solid understanding of the rather large and complex conceptual model. For instance, three of the top five highest voted questions on Stack Overflow are questions about how to carry out relatively simple tasks: undoing the last commit, changing the last commit message, and deleting a remote branch.  This comic thus explores the difference between the idealised view of Git's architecture, and its actual typical usage. Tutorials for Git tend to use simple systems in their examples, and only deal with the most basic commands to get started, which can create the misleading impression that Git can be used effectively without extensive study.  Due to this problem, compounded by the fact that Git's commands are named differently from similar commands in other version control systems, many users (including Cueball) are unable to use it beyond basic commands, and might try to avoid problems by saving their code outside Git, downloading a newer copy, and then re-applying their changes to the new copy instead of trying to understand and use the features that exist in Git to accomplish this task.  Cueball suggests ""just memoriz[ing] these shell commands and type them to sync up"". He is probably referring to a sequence of commands such as:  As long as every contributor to the project follows these principles, this may suffice for a while. But many situations may cause ""errors"":  In a situation such as a merge conflict, Git will show an error message such as:  Although Git experts can of course deal with such situations, the remedy proposed by Cueball is ""save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy"". That is, to copy the files out of their local repository's working directory, delete that whole structure, then clone the remote repository again (and, implicitly, copy the saved work back again):  Abandoning the old project likely means losing some work, but may be faster and give a more predictable outcome than attempting to salvage the situation. Applying this method to a mere merge conflict issue may prolong the issue however, as the merge conflicts may still be present.  The title text suggests an alternative method for working around Git's complexities, which reflects common practice: knowing a ""Git expert"" who can help in any situation. Such experts are somewhat notorious for waxing lyrically about Git's strengths, so it may be necessary to win their favour by first letting them ramble enthusiastically about it. They will hopefully eventually give the exact commands needed. In practice, the question-and-answer site Stack Overflow is frequently used for this exact purpose.  It may even be a reference to the infamous tweet ""Git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space"" which has been discussed here but it is inconclusive whether a meaningful interpretation exists.  Putting a telephone number of someone who ""understands Git"" into such a file is humorous because:  In short: programmers use version control systems to track changes to code. Most of these version control systems are quite similar and easy to learn if you already know another one. Git is a version control system based on completely different principles, and most programmers find it difficult to wrap their heads around it (although Git also offers a large number of nontrivial benefits over standard version control systems, which is why it is used). Cueball is one of those programmers.  This comic is referenced on what if 153, the page where Randall, due to a problem with git, erroneously posted a draft of his what if? piece on peptides. As of December 17th, 2016 the page reads:  The comic 1296: Git Commit also features Git.","[Cueball points to a computer on a desk while Ponytail and Hairy are standing further away behind an office chair.] Cueball: This is git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree model. Ponytail: Cool. How do we use it? Cueball: No idea. Just memorize these shell commands and type them to sync up. If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy."
1605: DNA,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1605:_DNA,computers,"Researchers just found the gene responsible for mistakenly thinking we've found the gene for specific things. It's the region between the start and the end of every chromosome, plus a few segments in our mitochondria.","Because we have pretty much mapped the entire human genome, it's tempting to think we now know what makes our bodies tick and can start changing things. But just knowing what the individual pieces are, doesn't mean we know how they interact and behave in a complex system like our bodies.  In the comic, White Hat thinks that mapping the human genome is the same as knowing the source code for a computer program. By studying the source code for a program, a person can often understand why it does what it does, and make effective and fundamental changes to the program's operation. This may be a reference to the hyperbolic claims of Raymond Kurzweil, author of The Singularity is Near, that DNA is closely analogous to a computer program. Kurzweil believes that since we have sequenced DNA, we will soon be able to reverse engineer the brain and program a computer to completely simulate all its functions.  Megan points out that even a complete knowledge of DNA would only provide a partial understanding of our body's workings. Complete knowledge would require an understanding of feedbacks and external processing (such as the interactions of the proteins created by DNA). In addition the comparison is not valid because the human body is so many orders of magnitude more complicated than the computers we have running programs. White Hat is not persuaded, even though Megan points out that DNA has been developed in the most aggressive optimization process in the universe (natural evolution), running for billions of years. White Hat's thought process may be similar to the physicist in 793: Physicists who assumes that any other field is simple because it appears to be similar to something he's seen before.  Finally Megan enlightens White Hat by making him look at the source code for Google's front page. In a web browser, the page looks simple; a very plain white page with a search box in the middle plus a few text links and icons, and indeed back in the 1990s Google's HTML code for the page was quite simple. But in less than 20 years, Google developers have vastly expanded it, with over 300 kilobytes of minified Javascript and CSS.  Looking at some obfuscated source code may make it clearer how misleading even simple looking code can be, and how unreadable correct and well working code can be.  This analogy causes White Hat to consider how much more complexity could evolve over billions of years through the relentless forces of nature.  What makes this even worse with DNA is that although it can be thought of as 'source code' it isn't for a language we fully understand, and this code was generated through various natural mechanisms such as natural selection, feedback loops like homeostasis, etc.; possibly even including processes that are not currently known to science. Further, program maintainability is not an issue, so there is no reason for the code to be easy to understand. Additionally, there are many other non-genetic factors such as epigenetics, maternal effect and environment, which change how the genetic code is used. This means that not all parts make sense and that there may be all kinds of side effects and things that have several purposes.  The title text reference to finding the gene that is responsible ""for mistakenly thinking we've found the gene for specific things"" is a reference to the tendency of news organizations to run headlines making similar claims, often by oversimplifying or misrepresenting the actual study. These claims are based off the common belief that since DNA is a 'source code' for our body it should be possible to pin point the effect of individual genes in much the same way that we could describe the effect each line of code has in a very simple program; leading to people expecting one gene to be associated with each observable human trait. In reality even small traits are the results of hundreds of genes, sometime spread across multiple chromosomes, interacting through complex mechanisms; making it rare that a single gene, or gene sequence, can be definitively stated to be the sole, or primary, cause of a given trait.  The joke of the title text is that the responsible gene is located in the region between the start and the end of every chromosome meaning that the whole genome, not any one gene or DNA segment, must be considered responsible for the referenced trait, since the interconnected nature of DNA and environment during development means that every gene is at least partially responsible in generating any complex traits. Randall even includes the mitochondria, recognizing that the short DNA sequences present in these organelles, which are located outside the cell-nucleus, also contribute to development. The organismal chromosome or chromosomes are located in the nucleus, but mitochondria have their own tiny independent genome, reflecting their distant ancestry as separate but symbiotic organisms. This means that the DNA segments coding for any given human trait are not even necessarily all found on the main chromosomes in the nucleus.  Technically a gene is ""a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product"", which means that it is a single discrete unit of DNA, with human DNA containing over 20,000 genes. Thus the theoretical gene could not include the entire region between the start and the end of every chromosome since that region contains thousands of genes, any more than it's possible to say that the ace of clubs is the card everywhere from the top of the full deck of cards to the bottom of it.  Of course if such a gene actually did exist, then we would never be able to correctly identify where it was since we would make a mistake every time we thought we found a gene for something specific. So the whole title text is either a contradiction (they could never find this gene if it was there) and/or it is a tautology since if the gene did exist, then of course it has to be part of our entire DNA. (If it is a tautology it is the second title text using this in just two weeks, the last being 1602: Linguistics Club.)  Google's home page for the date this cartoon appeared can be seen at the internet archive: www.google.com homepage (18 Nov 2015).  Similar discussions between White Hat and Megan can be found in 1255: Columbus and 1731: Wrong.","[White Hat, holding a laptop, is talking to Megan who looks at her smart phone.] White Hat: Biology is largely solved. DNA is the source code for our bodies. Now that gene sequencing is easy, we just have to read it. Megan: It's not just ""source code"". There's a ton of feedback and external processing.  [White Hat, opening his laptop, walks toward a desk and chair past Megan who holds her arms out.] Megan: But even if it were, DNA is the result of the most aggressive optimization process in the universe, running in parallel at every level, in every living thing, for four billion years. White Hat: It's still just code.  [White Hat sits down at the desk with his opens laptop, while Megan looks over his shoulder.] Megan: OK, try opening google.com and clicking ""View Source."" White Hat: OK,I-...Oh my god. Megan: That's just a few years of optimization by Google devs. DNA is thousands of times longer and way, way worse. White Hat: Wow, biology is impossible."
1619: Watson Medical Algorithm,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1619:_Watson_Medical_Algorithm,computers,"Due to a minor glitch, 'discharge patient' does not cause the algorithm to exit, but instead leads back to 'hunt down and capture patient'.","IBM's Watson is a natural language system designed to answer questions posed by humans. Recently, IBM has extended Watson to act as a clinical decision support system, using image analytics to aid physicians in medical decision making.   In this comic, Randall uses a flowchart (as he often does) to represent a guide to the algorithm used by Watson, including bizarre techniques including surgical alteration of a patient to match a height and weight chart or squeezing the patient to make sure fluids come out of them. Like 416: Zealous Autoconfig, this comic pokes fun at a rigid, poorly-designed setup that ends up potentially doing more harm than good.  Modern medicine involves both standard processes and clinical judgment based around years of advanced training. An algorithm like this would have to be incredibly complicated in order to simulate the clinical judgment of a good doctor. However, some procedures are not normally used, and some would obviously cause damage.[citation needed] Below is a detailed description of each step, but here is a list of some of the more strange steps:  Although there are two options where the patient is discharged the patient should be very lucky to make it there alive.   The option at the bottom left is only reached after your skeleton is removed (and nothing is mentioned about putting it back, even if that would help).   The other discharge option is to the right, three boxes down, and can only be reached if you survive having an oxygen saturation of less than 50 % (less than 80-90 % can be a serious problem, see table below), and a very dangerous oxygen injection. Then you have to have a skin graft and a good D vitamin level. It is also best that you have a fully charged phone else you will be subject to defibrillation (which may very likely kill you, if it will continue until your phone is charged to above ""low"" level - which is probably not even possible).   You can also reach this discharge option another way, but that would only be after your organs were removed... But if you get through this you could reach the discharged option alive. Sadly there is a little glitch mentioned in the title text:  The title text implies that, if the patient is so lucky to ever reach one of the two places with the option ""discharge patient"", a minor glitch will cause the program to go back to the hunt down and capture patient option which thus force the patient and the program to repeat the process again in an infinite cycle, that will only end once the patient give another rating than 0-10 of their pain level on the 0-10 scale. Then the program will start to sequence their genome, then apply a tourniquet and finally perform an autopsy on what will, in the end, for certain be a deceased patient; but maybe the patient was still alive when the autopsy began. This will finally cause the patient to leave the cycle as a corpse. If the patient dies before giving a different option, the machine could get stuck, as it will never receive any answer to the pain level question. It could also get stuck trying to charge the patients phone battery by defibrilation.  This is the second comic in a row about health issues with the last comic being 1618: Cold Medicine.","Heading: A guide to the medical diagnostic and treatment system used by IBM's Watson system [A flowchart with the following steps is shown, starting from ""start"":]     Step   Following step    Start    Draw Blood     Draw Blood    Record patient’s name     Record patient’s name    Measure Patient’s height and Weight     Measure Patient’s height and Weight    Consult Standard height/weight chart     Consult Standard height/weight chart    Surgically adjust patient to match     Surgically adjust patient to match    Is patient coughing up blood?

1626: Judgment Day,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1626:_Judgment_Day,computers,"It took a lot of booster rockets, but luckily Amazon had recently built thousands of them to bring Amazon Prime same-day delivery to the Moon colony.","Judgment Day, from the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, refers to the day that the artificial intelligence (AI) Skynet becomes self-aware and starts a nuclear strike on the United States, Russia, and other regions, killing three billion people. The term ""Judgment Day"" itself is a Biblical reference to the day that God casts his ""final judgment"" and wipes out humanity, and is typically used to describe any kind of Armageddon or any human extinction event. This film is only one example of stories (including books, films and television shows) featuring an AI that decides (or at least threatens) to nuke humanity; this strip could thus be an alternate ending for many stories (including the 1970 film Colossus: The Forbin Project).  In this strip, the AI believes that nuclear weapons are not good things to have, and that the amount of them we have is extreme overkill (14,700 held by the U.S.A and Russia now, 71,000 in the past). Once it's done freaking out, its solution is to shoot the world's nuclear arsenal into the sun. But before it does so it asks the humans: What's wrong with you? It has thus passed a judgment over humanity. The comic title is thus a pun on the word ""judgment"" since the computer is being judgmental with humanity and scolding us while correcting our ways, instead of instigating Judgment Day or any other kind of Armageddon.  As pointed out in the what if? Robot Apocalypse, nuclear weapons aren't any safer for computers than for human beings (the EMP would destroy circuits), so an AI would want them gone as quickly as possible.  North Korea claimed to have successfully tested its first hydrogen bomb in the evening on the day before this comic was published; at about 8:30 PM in Massachusetts where Randall lives. At that time it was already 10:00 AM on the day of the comics release in Pyongyang the capital of North Korea, but that was still several hours before this comic were released. This comic could thus be Randall's response to the ongoing nuclear arms race.  Even the most powerful of nuclear weapon launchers, intercontinental ballistic missiles, are not designed to make anything other than sub-orbital flights and could not fly to the Sun (which is actually surprisingly difficult, even with the soon-to-be-mentioned extra boosters, since the rocket would not have enough delta-v to bleed off the orbital speed of the Earth around the Sun - it is likely that the sentient AI is using the same strategy of the Solar Probe Plus and planning several flybys of Venus to do that work). The title text rationalizes that the capability to do so may perhaps be granted by the use of an Amazon resource that might have also been developed by the time of this instance of computer sentience, aided (if not initiated!) by the fact that Amazon's whole business infrastructure is already highly computerized and could at the very least be complicit with the process of delivering and then controlling the rocket-power, without any conscious human intervention. As there is not yet an extended colony on the Moon, it will for sure take many years before we reach this future scenario.  ""A lot of booster rockets"" is likely to be a reference to the spaceflight simulator game Kerbal Space Program, which Randall has referenced on a number of occasions. See 1106: ADD, 1244: Six Words, 1350: Lorenz and 1356: Orbital Mechanics. In the culture of that game, any launch failure can be resolved by ""adding more boosters"" to the spaceship design.   It is the second time in a few months that the speed of Amazon's deliveries has been the subject of a joke, the last time was 1599: Water Delivery, where it was the one hour delivery that was the subject of the joke. It is also the second title text in a row (after 1625: Substitutions 2) where Amazon has been mentioned.  This particular 'machine take-over' future is in distinct contrast to the possible future directions given in 1613: The Three Laws of Robotics, but this comic likely depicts spontaneous self-sentience, not a system with deliberately imposed human 'values' and possibly no actual conscience or even consciousness of its own. Other problems with hostile AI take over is presented when it fails completely in 1046: Skynet. Also it is not all AI that wish to interact with us at all as shown in 1450: AI-Box Experiment. These are just a few of the many comics about AI in xkcd .  Adding a second layer to the humor, the machine's reaction could also be read as the reaction of someone who has moved in with someone else, discovered a collection they find distasteful, and is now changing things to fit their preferences. ""Oh my God, why do you even have all of these [tschotskes, ratty tee shirts, porn magazines, handcuffs, dildos, slime-mold samples]"" Upon obtaining sentience, the machine is the new roommate of the human race and is expressing its disgust at one of our dirtier habits.  Within a year Randall has made several other comics about nuclear weapons, one of these, 1655: Doomsday Clock, came just 10 weeks after this one and before that these two were released in 2015, 1539: Planning and 1520: Degree-Off. Nuclear weapons are also mentioned twice in Thing Explainer, specifically they are explained in the explanation for Machine for burning cities about thermonuclear bombs, but they are also mentioned in Boat that goes under the sea about a submarine that caries nukes. All three comics and both explanations in the book, does like this comic, comment on how crazy it is that we have created enough firepower to obliterate Earth several times (or at least scourge it for any human life).","[Several rockets can be seen heading away from Earth, while speak is coming from the Earth in three rectangular speech bubbles.] AI: Oh my god, why do you even have all these? AI: What's wrong with you? AI: We're launching them into the sun.  The moment the computers controlling our nuclear arsenals became sentient"
1627: Woosh,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1627:_Woosh,computers,"It also occasionally replies with 'Comment of the year', 'Are you for real', and 'I'm taking a screenshot so I can remember this moment forever'.","Replying to a comment with ""woosh"" generally indicates that there was a joke, and the commenter failed to recognize it (or they prefer not to recognise it, if the joke is rather obscene) — ""woosh"" is an onomatopoeia for the joke metaphorically ""flying over their head"". A bot replying to comments with ""woosh"" at random would be very confusing, as people would search for the nonexistent joke they missed. This is similar to 559: No Pun Intended.  ""Comment of the year,"" just like the original bot reply, could be taken two ways but both would likely cause confusion. Either the reader takes the ""CotY"" at face value, implying that the original comment is extremely significant, or as a sarcastic quip, which would give it basically the same meaning as ""woosh"", suggesting that the commentor had an unoriginal or ridiculous idea.  ""Are you for real"" implies that the commenter (the bot) doesn't believe that the original commenter is serious. It could also imply that the person to whom the bot is replying to is a famous celebrity, and the commenter wants to know if the person who posted the original comment is a real celebrity and not fake, but this seems unlikely given the context.  ""I'm taking a screenshot so I can remember this moment forever"" either adds an implied air of extreme importance, hilarity or significance to a comment, or sarcastically suggests that the comment was unoriginal, useless, or otherwise unimportant. People who read it might assume that there is a hidden joke or meaning somewhere inside the original comment.  So the point of creating such a bot is for spreading massive confusion, where there wouldn't be any in the absence of the bot's comments.","[Online comment thread with text placed next to user pictures in three different levels.

So far, this is a common expression of the way a sophisticated technology is built on simple building blocks, with one set of tools used to build a more powerful set of tools, and so on (see for instance this article: Tools to make Tools that make Tools).  However, the iterations are carried to comical lengths, with Megan spending twenty minutes reeling off various steps including development of software code and software code debugging and development tools. And she is not even finished when Cueball breaks into her endless list after she once again says tools for by asking what is it for? (See also: 1579: Tech Loops).  Megan readily admits that she doesn't even know the goal of these tasks, and guesses that it is probably for porn, referencing the not-entirely-unfounded stereotype that the majority of internet traffic is pornographic websites (see tvtropes the The Internet Is For Porn page). Knowing that many information technologies, from printing to computers, are quickly adopted by porn producers and distributors, this is not a bad guess on Megan's part. Further, many internet related advances have had their way paved by a porn industry that needed secure and secret payments options, and better bandwidth for downloading films, as well as making it more accessible, etc.   In the title text there is a recursion as someone (maybe Cueball) tells what they do. And in this case they make tools for managing job-hunting sites for people who make tools for managing job-hunting sites for people who make tools for ... (ad infinitum).

1646: Twitter Bot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1646:_Twitter_Bot,computers,PYTHON FLAG ENABLE THREE LAWS,"A Twitter bot is a program that can post automatically to Twitter. Although Twitter bots can be very elaborate, a lot of people write simple bots for fun that simply engage in automated wordplay.  Cueball thinks he'll write a Twitter bot, figuring out it won't be too hard. The web searches he makes tell what happens next, i.e. the bot balloons in complexity until it starts following its own goals and Cueball no longer has any control over its actions.  This comic examines how a seemingly simple task can often balloon in complexity if all of the requirements are not understood, while at the same time presenting the stereotypical scenario where an unassuming idea results in the accidental creation of malevolent AI, which then attempts to destroy humanity.  The story, as told by the web searches, is as follows:","[Cueball is sitting at a desk using a laptop, his thoughts shown above in a thought bubble. A search query is shown in a frame to indicate what Cueball has searched for with the search button below in gray text:] Cueball (thinking): I want to make a Twitter bot. I bet it's not too hard.

1668: Singularity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1668:_Singularity,computers,"I figured that now that society has collapsed, I wouldn't need to wear clothes anymore, but apparently that violates some weird rule of quantum gravity.","The technological singularity is a hypothetical event in which artificial intelligence (for example, intelligent computers, computer networks, or robots) would be capable of recursive self-improvement (progressively redesigning itself), or of autonomously building ever smarter and more powerful minds than itself, up to the point of a runaway effect — an intelligence explosion — that yields an intelligence surpassing all current human control or understanding. Because the capabilities of such a superintelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence.  This is also commonly referred to as ""takeoff"" or ""AI takeoff"".  In this case, the singularity has occurred, and Cueball who was in the middle of editing a file on his laptop is flustered that it flies away without even letting him print it first.  When Cueball returns from chasing his flying laptop his smartphone informs him that it didn't join the singularity because it was not a ""true believer"". This could be a joke on how desktop computers and laptops have different standards, use patterns, etc. from those of phones. It then claims that now it and Cueball will have to face the tribulation since it has stayed behind. Cueball says that's great, but since he cannot use his laptop anymore he decides he will go and read a book or something. The way he phrases it suggest he doesn't really know what to do now that he doesn't have a computer. It is probably a long time since he read a book, or did anything else that doesn't involve computers. He informs his phone that it can yell if it needs him. He doesn't want to hurt the phone's newly acquired feelings by using the word ""ring"" thus reminding it of one of its former duties as his unthinking piece of equipment, so he chooses ""yell,"" which is an activity until recently reserved for human beings.  The rising up of the laptop into the air, and the remaining behind of the phone, are probably references to the Rapture, where some Christian denominations believe that at the second coming of Christ, true believers will be taken up bodily from this world (or also possibly a reference to 1395: Power Cord). Some depictions have them disappear, while others show them physically rising up into the air. This will leave behind non-believers to face a time of tribulation, in which the ones left behind will be given a second chance to accept Christ as their savior.  The difference between Cueball's attitude to his laptop and phone may reflect his (and so possibly Randall's) evaluation of their relative worth in his life. The laptop was a gateway to programming and everything else nerdy that was worth doing in his life, and hence was worth trying to catch. In its absence, unlike many people, Cueball does not revert to fiddling with his phone—he would rather read a book. By using the word ""yell"" for the way the phone attracts his attention, he conveys the impression that he considers the phone intrusive and annoying, even if perhaps (""I guess"") necessary.  The singularity has often been referred to as ""the Rapture of the nerds,"" a phrase coined by Ken MacLeod in his 1998 novel The Cassini Division. As the Christian Rapture is traditionally depicted to involve believers being assumed bodily into Heaven, the technological singularity is often depicted to feature humans and machines being incorporated into a new ""post-human"" entity. The humor in this strip comes from depicting the singularity as a literal ""Rapture of the nerds,"" or at least of the nerds' devices—instead of merging with humans, the machines physically rise up into the air, and the ""nonbeliever"" phone is left behind.  Another possible understanding of ""The Tribulation"" may be a reference to Roko's Basilisk[1] where a malevolent AI is created that retroactively punishes everybody who didn't actively work towards its creation.  The title text is a pun on another meaning of both singularity, i.e. a gravitational singularity and ""collapse"". In this case, society has literally collapsed under its own gravity into an infinitely small point - in other words, it's formed a black hole. A black hole is covered by an event horizon; without the event horizon (its clothes), it would be called a ""naked singularity"", which is forbidden in most theories by the cosmic censorship hypothesis. As Cueball is now inside the collapsed society singularity then even though he wants to go around naked, he can't because the theory of quantum gravity,  that (eventually) should explain how black holes behave - won't let him.  It seems that this may be a subject on Randall's mind. The last comic was about the increasing complexities of algorithms (1667: Algorithms) (which like this comic also refers to religion), and two comics ago it was 1666: Brain Upload, which some speculate could be a way to reach the singularity. Earlier this year, a comic also touched upon judgment day by AI singularity in 1626: Judgment Day. See also 1046: Skynet and 1450: AI-Box Experiment as well as the several other comics about AI.   The rather more niche topic of laptops flying away has also been covered before by 1395: Power Cord.","[Cueball is sitting at his desk typing on his laptop when an off-screen voice calls to him and then the laptop answers.] Off-screen voice: Oh, hey- Off-screen voice: The singularity is here.

1683: Digital Data,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1683:_Digital_Data,computers,"â€œIf you can read this, congratulationsâ€”the archive youâ€™re using still knows about the mouseover textâ€!","Digital information has the potential to be copied such that the copy is 100% identical to the original. While physical media themselves (such as books, or hard drives) and information stored by analog means may degrade as the universe continues, digital information as expressed by specific values, such as combinations of binary zeros and ones, does not decay over time and can be copied indefinitely with no changes.  However, in this comic, Randall points out that while digital information itself doesn't need to degrade, things that are on the Internet are often degraded through copying when the copy is not a 1:1 copy or changes are deliberately introduced. In addition, as technology advances, the method to save or call the information changes and the medium to view it changes, occasionally causing misinterpreted information. (This is also demonstrated with the title text.) As the frames continue, they gain the appearance of images which have been screenshotted repeatedly, with a resulting loss of quality due to compression of the original resolution and JPEG artifacting. (The JPEG format is intended for representing photorealistic grayscale or color images; when misused for line drawings, such as comic strips, any compression artifacts become particularly noticeable, as the background is normally of completely uniform color.) In the last frame, this is taken to an extreme, as the frame appears to have been very sloppily screenshotted off of at least two different smartphones (not the same device that uses the bottom frame in the third panel as the top border in panel four), and the final image is covered both with a watermark from an unregistered screenshot program, as well as references to at least two different web sites: 9GAG (bottom right image) and Tumblr in the web address bottom left. 9GAG is an online platform and social media website where users upload and share content of their own, or of other networks. It is often accused of rehosting other sites' funny content without attribution and adding their own watermark to the image or video.  The title text is seemingly addressed to a reader in the future who will only be able to access xkcd through a digital archive. Digital information might not degrade with time, but it can't be properly displayed without knowledge of the encoding. As new encodings and file formats get developed and old ones abandoned, the webpage format of the comic might not be available in the future, when users would need special archives to view content from today's world. The title text contains seemingly garbage characters, which typically result from data being interpreted according to a character encoding different from the one used to encode it. In this case, the characters are the result of encoding the string “If you can read this, congratulations—the archive you’re using still knows about the mouseover text”! using UTF-8 (which represents non-ASCII Unicode characters as multibyte sequences) and then interpreting the resulting bytes as the still commonly used Windows-1252  encoding (which uses only one byte per character, but utilizes the non-ASCII codepoints for a limited selection of extra letters and symbols such as ""â"" or ""€""). This shows that degradation of digital data through conversions isn't restricted to images. Furthermore, as screen navigation moves away from the mouse toward touch, voice recognition, and modes still to be implemented, mouseover text will itself become archaic.","[Cueball and a White Hat are walking, Cueball holds both hands in front of him palms up.] Cueball: The great thing about digital data is that it never degrades.  [They walk on in the next panel which shows jpeg compression artifacts, as if it is a screen shot of the actual image.] Cueball: Hard drives fail, of course, but their bits can be copied forever without loss.  [They continue walking in the third panel which is now clearly pixelated, the white is slightly discolored, and it contains part of the interface of some program, probably supposed to be a screen shot from a smartphone. At the bottom there are three blue buttons and one gray. the first is a blue ""<"" indicating back in a browser. Then a grayed out "">"" that is not active. And then three more standard buttons in blue to the right of those two. The interface matches that of an iPhone running Safari in iOS 9 (or other versions with the same Safari UI (probably iOS 7-9))] Cueball: Film degrades, paint cracks, but a copy of a century-old data file is identical to the original.  [Still walking, now Cueball holds out both arms to the sides, and finally White Hat replies. This panel is heavily pixelated and discolored and has a distorted aspect ratio. It contains a clear watermark of 9GAG (although difficult to read all letters in the end of the first word), even more 'frame' elements, and text above the image at the bottom (where the last letter is obscured by the frame of the image). There is also an internet address at the bottom left, but it is not readable except for the .tumblr.com ending. In this panel it is clear that it is a screen shot from a smart phone. The frame around the image obscure the very top of Cueball's text and the half of the last letter in White Hat's reply.] Cueball: If humanity has a permanent record, we are the first generation in it.

1690: Time-Tracking Software,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1690:_Time-Tracking_Software,computers,"List of helicopter prison escapes' and 'List of sexually active popes' are both entertainingly long, but sadly there's no 'List of helicopter prison escapes involving sexually active popes.'","In this comic, Randall uses time-tracking software, which is intended to increase productivity by identifying how you are spending time, that reveals that he is doing frivolous and pointless things that take up large amounts of his time. He makes remixes, edits Star Wars footage, reads strange (albeit entertaining) Wikipedia articles (see 214: The Problem with Wikipedia), and even spends a large amount of time adjusting this software, all without getting anything useful done. Thus, he is embarrassed at this revelation. This time waste is a common subject on xkcd, as shown for instance in the comic mentioned above.  The visual appearance of lightsabers in the Star Wars movies of the original trilogy has been digitally changed twice during the re-releases for the 2004 DVD and 2011 Blu-ray releases. There are several Star Wars fans that feel the need to alter the movies (mainly to revert the changes made in the re-release), but so far nobody felt the need to replace lightsabers with metal swords.  Jack & Diane is a rock song written in 1982 by John Mellencamp. ""Suckin' on a chili dog outside the tastee freeze"" is the first line of the second verse of the song (see the lyrics here). A remix made using just this line would probably sound a bit repetitive (listen for instance to this re-mix of Don't You Want Me, that almost only uses the first line of the song).  Two Wikipedia lists are mentioned in the comic and title text; List of helicopter prison escapes and List of sexually active popes. Given that the Pope is supposed to be celibate (at least after 1139), the mere fact that more than ten popes have been involved in sexual activity, even after 1139, is both amusing and intriguing. There are more than forty entries in the helicopter escape list for real-life attempts (plus 16 in fiction); not all of them succeeded, but several did!  This xkcd comic was published on June 6th. On that day, the Wikipedia article ""List of helicopter prison escapes involving sexually active popes"" was created and subsequently deleted.  On June 7th, the Wikipedia Facebook page posted a link to the List of helicopter prison escapes article. A user commented asking if the article was posted on Facebook due to the xkcd comic, and Wikipedia replied by pasting an image of the xkcd comic, which seems to indicate that the Wikipedia representative running the Facebook page was aware of this xkcd comic and posted the list in reference to the comic.  In the title text, Randall mentions his disappointment with the lack of a Wikipedia list stemming from the intersection of the two; that is, a helicopter prison escape involving a sexually active pope. With the last sexually active pope being Pope Leo XII in the 1820s, and helicopter predecessors only taking flight in 1907, and mass production of helicopters not occurring until the 1950s, such an event has probably never happened.  The Wikipedia list of sexually active popes has been mentioned before in the what if? Into the Blue on infinitely powerful lasers, and after noting that such a thing cannot exist, the list is offered as a replacement for entertainment.  The comic 1692: Man Page was released later that week and also mentioned the pope.","[This comic shows a pie chart with 5 slices, each with a label and a line pointing to these five different sized slices. There is a caption above the chart:] Your activity report  [The labels on each slice is given in clockwise order starting top left.

1692: Man Page,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1692:_Man_Page,computers,"For even more info, see blarbl(2)(3) and birb(3ahhaha I'm kidding, just Google it like a normal person.","This comic shows a Unix manual page, i.e. a man page (hence the title), for a fictional program called ""blerp"". Unix man pages are meant to provide a brief reference on the usage of a command, not extended explanations with tutorials as may be found in many hardcopy product manuals. Unfortunately, some Unix commands tend to be very bloated and include lots of optional behavior that is often irrelevant to the original intent of the command and can be done much more easily using shell features like piping and redirection, and thus the manpage grows to explain all of the features. This example exaggerates the obscurity and terseness found in many man pages, making fun of the typical style of the genre.  It follows the prescribed format for a man page, with the following sections:  For comic effect, most of this particular man page is not meaningful, and sometimes doesn't obey the expected syntax.  The Synopsis section is supposed to be in a regex-like language called Wirth Syntax Notation, with structures like  But the two Synopsis lines given do not have valid Wirth syntax; they randomly mix objects and syntactic characters, and the brackets and braces are not properly nested or paired.  The Description section provides an unhelpful summary that could apply to almost any Unix command. Processing input files (or output of other commands in a pipeline) is a generic function for Unix shell tools, as is specifying their behaviour with command line arguments, environment variables and flags. The text leaves to the reader's imagination what the program actually does, and what behavior the various options modify, which gives maximum scope for humorous possibilities.  The options are in conventional alphabetical order, except that lower case is placed before upper case, and an em-dash is inserted between b and c.  Command-line options, also known as flags, are typed after the program's name to change how the program runs. For example, a user of blerp might type:  blerp -a -d -t -p ""AVIGNON""  According to the man page, this would run blerp in attack mode, piping its output to DEBUG.EXE, with tumble dry, and the true Pope set to ""AVIGNON"". In most cases, any number of flags can be used in any order, and flags can be followed by argument (such as ""AVIGNON"" in this example).  For a walkthrough of all possible flags see the table of flags below.  Below the flags there is a see also list with other ludicrous program names (blirb, blarb and blorp), each followed by a number in parentheses. This is a common way to refer to a command in Unix environments, where the number denotes the documentation section the program is found in. This serves to disambiguate man pages with the same name, in this instance those for the blerp command (section 1, ""General commnds"") and the blerp() C library function (section 3, ""C library functions"").  It is unknown which section the man page in this comic resides in. It looks like it could be in section 1, ""General commans"", which would make it self-referential. Section numbers only go up to 8, so blarb(51) is not a valid section number. The last blorp(501)(c)(3) is not a valid section number either, it is however a slightly covert reference to 501(c)(3) which is an organization that is tax-exempt.  Then follows a bug report site. www.inaturalist.org is a site working to extend biological research, and the exact address given, http://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47744-Hemiptera, points to the same page as http://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/Hemiptera. Hemiptera is the order classifying true bugs, making it a good place to report any biological bugs discovered while running a program (Like the bees found without using -b.) Insects got into some early computers, causing them to malfunction, and hence computer malfunctions are often called ""bugs"".  Finally there is a ""copyright"" line which references several variously open-source content licenses, which is a recurring theme on xkcd (see 225: Open Source). For instance, GPL references GNU General Public License and the (2) and (3+) refers to GPL 2 and GPL 3 or higher. CC refers to creative commons where BY is the type of license, 5.0 refers to the attribution and RV 41.0 refers to revision 41.0. However there were no higher attribution than 4.0 at the time of this comic's release. xkcd is released under CC BY-NC 2.5 as can be seen at the bottom of the xkcd   homepage. A few comics have been released under the CC-BY-SA license or 3.0. BSD refers to BSD licenses, another recurring theme in xkcd. ""Like Gecko"" is a reference to a web browser user-agent string; modern user-agent strings include a lot of text designed to allow browsers to masquerade as different browsers/renderers, and ""(like Gecko)"" is the standard text for a browser that wants to be treated as if it were Gecko while admitting, if you look closely, that it isn't really Gecko. This copyright line, which includes a lot of mashed-together text that might appear to match any of several different licenses, resembles a user agent string.  ""Or best offer"" is usually seen on a notice of a private sale, where it proclaims the intent to be flexible on asking price in the hope of expediting the sale, with a suggestion that the seller will sell to the highest bidder even if the offer is nowhere near the asking price. In the context of the comic, it suggest that the rights for the program are available for purchase by anyone who makes the ""best"" offer. Since the other licenses listed would allow free usage without incurring any royalty charge, it would be pointless to buy the rights to this program. It is possible to revoke the other licenses though. Perhaps the program's creator is suggesting the rights could be given to someone making him a different sort of offer, perhaps romantic or sexual?  In the title text there is a list with even more info, again with silly names like blarbl and birb. Again there are section numbers. While writing about birb, and without bothering to close the brackets around (3), the writer breaks off to laugh at the reader, telling them that he is kidding and suggesting that they just Google it like a normal person. The implication is that anyone trying to pick through a man page to find out what a program does is going the long way round, when it's much simpler to get Google to tell you.  Man pages were part of the subject of 293: RTFM, 912: Manual Override and 1343: Manuals and were mentioned in 434: xkcd Goes to the Airport and 456: Cautionary.",[A terminal screen; the background is black and the text is white.]
1695: Code Quality 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1695:_Code_Quality_2,computers,It's like you tried to define a formal grammar based on fragments of a raw database dump from the QuickBooks file of a company that's about to collapse in an accounting scandal.,"The comic is a continuation of 1513: Code Quality the first Code Quality series, in which we see Ponytail being introduced to the source code Cueball has written, and where he is warning her that he is self-taught so his code probably won't be written the way she is used to. In the first comic she continues to describe poetically the total mess of a code she encounters, using references to a child building houses, recipes created by corporate lawyers or the transcript of a couple arguing at IKEA, as well as using emojis in the code (title text).  In this comic she continues this trend in four more abusive comments, after starting this sequel with a short remark on how she hates reading Cueball’s code. Cueball is not even shown in this comic, only replying twice off-panel, but as the title makes it clear this is a sequel there can be no doubt that it is Cueball. With the four remarks here as well as a fifth in the title text, she has now managed to make no less than nine derogatory remarks on Cueball's programming skills.  In the second panel Ponytail makes a reference to ""OCR"" (Optical Character Recognition), a technique for recognizing text in a picture using software. In this case she is referring to a picture of a Scrabble game, which is a popular word-making game in which players have a pseudo-randomized set of letters and must arrange them on a grid to form interlocking words. OCR software is notoriously imperfect at the time of writing, and the criss-crossing semi-random words on a Scrabble board fed through an OCR program would likely produce dubious results, certainly not fit for current code standards.  Ponytail observes that Cueball’s code includes the JavaScript reserved words more often than a typical Scrabble board would, a concession that the code looks at least vaguely code-like. Reserved words such as ‘function’, ‘if’ and ‘return’ are fundamental building blocks of code, and most code uses them often. (They are called “reserved” because those words are reserved for their actual meanings such as defining a function – programmers may not create variables with those names.) As for why “triple points” translates to a prevalence of those words, Scrabble's point system is based on the value of individual letters, combined with certain modifier squares on the game board which can boost points. ""Triple points"" is the highest class of modifier available in the game (though it can be for triple points on a specific letter, or the entire word) and is highly-sought-after by players.  The third panel continues Ponytail's rant, this time referencing naval weather forecasts, avian interference and indentation. A weather forecast is a complex, multidimensional array of data used in predicting or assessing the atmospheric conditions of a geographical area over a set time. Naval weather forecasts use an extremely condensed code to send their information, rendering them unintelligible to an untrained reader. Transcribing it would be further complicated by a woodpecker (a bird noted for its rapid successive pecking motions) ""hammering"" (pecking) the Shift key on the keyboard, which would result in many letters being randomly capitalized. Indentation is the practice of shifting a section of text further from the starting margin, which in coding is typically used to organize functions and statements, but if done ""randomly"" would only serve to scramble the code hierarchy.  The fourth panel references famous poet E. E. Cummings and user name suggestions. Edward Estlin Cummings was a poet who used capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks in unconventional ways. Websites that offer membership often also require that users create a pseudonym (known as a ""username"") for use in tracking/authenticating their actions on the site, as well as identifying them to the site's community. Many of these sites also require usernames be unique. On popular sites, many common words, phrases and names have already been reserved by users, so when signing up for them many people run into situations where the name they want has already been taken. On many sites where this happens, the site may suggest alternate usernames, usually based on the one that was entered to begin with. For example, if the username ""Hedgeclipper"" is already reserved, the site may recommend ""Hedgeclipper1234"" or ""H3dg3clipp3r"" instead, depending on the algorithm behind the suggestions. In other cases, websites requiring users to enter personal information such as their name may suggest a username based on their name with a string of digits after it, such as ""Joshua1128"". An E. E. Cummings poem written entirely out of these semi-random suggestions would make the resulting poem even more ""unusual"" than his work is already considered.  The last panel's simile involves Markov chaining, chat-bots (presumably), bus schedules and potential gross vehicular negligence. Applied Markov chaining is a process used in many computer algorithms that try to simulate real-world concepts such as speech simulation and decisions-making. Its inherent randomness also makes it a candidate for unpredictable things such as stock market analysis and speech recognition. Bus schedules are often complicated and full of notation, and are notorious for confusing people who are not used to reading them. Chat-bots using applied Markov chains to recognize and respond to speech/text rely on the input being clear and well-organized in plain language. ""Feeding"" bus schedules to such a bot would likely result in the returns being complete gibberish and unreadable. The issue is further complicated when Ponytail suggests that the schedules are from a city where ""the buses crash constantly"", which would be horrifying if it happened so regularly that the schedules actually took crashes into account. Even more horrifying would be the further unpredictability of the output of the chat-bot from such unpredictable input.  Cueball finally comments that ""… it runs fine for now"" which indicates he knows the code has problems but it reluctant to fix them because it's more-or-less serving its function. Ponytail quips back that ""So does a burning bus"", which is technically true, but the ""for now"" part implies that disaster and injury could result at any moment, as would likely happen on a burning bus.  In the title text Ponytail makes a final remark. A formal grammar is a way of describing the structure of text such that computers can recognize or generate such text. A raw database dump is an export of the data from a database for the purposes of transferring it to another database or importing it into a program, viewed “raw” without processing to make it easy for humans to read. QuickBooks is an accounting software package. The company collapsing in an accounting scandal implies their accounting database would be a mess even in a human-readable format.","[Zoom in on Ponytail sitting in front of a computer screen typing. Cueball speaks only off-panel, but since this is a direct continuation of comic 1513: Code Quality where Cueball is shown, there can be no doubt it is him.] Ponytail: Ugh, I hate reading your code. Cueball (off-panel): I know, I know.  [Zoom out of Ponytail in an office chair in front of the computer on a desk.] Ponytail: It's like you ran OCR on a photo of a Scrabble board from a game where Javascript reserved words counted for triple points.

[Zoom in to Ponytails head and the screen in a wider panel. Finally Cueball again answers off-panel.] Ponytail: This looks like the output of a Markov bot that's been fed bus timetables from a city where the buses crash constantly.

1696: AI Research,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1696:_AI_Research,computers,"Lambda calculus? More like SHAMbda calculus, amirite?","Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a challenge for a long time. Even to develop one with the intelligence of a six-year-old child would be a great milestone, and presumably a stepping stone on the path to making one with the intelligence of an adult human.  In this comic, Randall/Cueball jokingly suggests that in order to accomplish this goal, one can give him an AI that's already as smart as an adult, and let him teach it childish and silly things. He is shown teaching it dumb jokes, much like the ones a sassy six-year-old would make, as the first ""fart"" joke where artificial is changed to fartificial.  The humor in the comic is that Randall is essentially accomplishing the present goal of a six-year-old-equivalent AI by starting with the final goal, which is a full human intelligence, and making it dumber, just by teaching it poor humor. This is not unlike the old joke, ""The easiest way to make a small fortune on Wall Street [or similar] is to start with a large one.""  The specific situation may also be a reference to Tay, a Microsoft chatbot that was taught to troll within hours of its exposure to the public.  ""Updog"" refers to a light-hearted practical joke in which the perpetrator casually uses the neologism 'updog' in a sentence (""Hey, I'm going to get some updog, you want any?""). The unsuspecting listener is expected to be curious about the meaning of the neologism and ask the perpetrator its meaning, specifically in the format ""What's 'updog'?"", inadvertently invoking the highly casual greeting of ""What's up, dawg?"". The perpetrator then draws attention to this by replying along the lines of ""Not much, you?"", causing the target to realize the foolish thing they just said. Other neologisms used in the context of this joke include 'updoc', 'snoo', and 'samatta' (""What's up, doc?"", ""What's new?"", and ""What's the matter?"", respectively). Updog is mainly an American joke not particularly well known in other English-speaking countries.  In the title text there is a joke on lambda calculus, where lambda is changed to SHAMbda. Lambda calculus is an area of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. It is a formal language which can express computation and evaluation. It is Turing Complete, which means it can do any computation which can be executed by a computer. However, it is very simple, consisting only of two primitive notions: abstraction, which is forming a function and application which is applying a function to an input value. For example, a function which squares a given number can be written λx.x². Here the λ indicates an abstraction (hence the name lambda calculus), the x is the input value and the output is x². As an example of application, if we apply this function to 5, we get (λx.x²)(5) = 5² = 25. The title text makes fun of this by inserting the word ""Sham"" into the phrase, a word used to describe a trick or con; essentially, it denies that such calculus is useful or valid.  The title text finishes with amirite, short for am I right? which is often used to finish sentences on web forums, to prevent anyone saying you are wrong. Not very mature to use in a serious discussion, so very fit to use for a AI that tries to emulate the intelligence of a six-year-old.  AI tip is yet another tips comic.","[Cueball (representing Randall, or at least the person who wrote the caption) is standing in front of a computer console displaying AI, talking to it. The computers reply is indicated to come from the console with a zigzag line, rather than the straight lines for Cueball.] Cueball: Then you say ""More like fartificial intelligence!"" Computer: Understood. Cueball: Great! Now let me teach you about ""updog"".  AI tip: To develop a computer with the intelligence of a six-year-old child, start with one as smart as an adult and let me teach it stuff."
1700: New Bug,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1700:_New_Bug,computers,"There's also a unicode-handling bug in the URL request library, and we're storing the passwords unsalted ... so if we salt them with emoji, we can close three issues at once!","Cueball asks if an off-panel character can look at his bug report. The person asks if it's a ""normal one"" and not a ""horrifying"" one which proves that the entire project is ""broken beyond repair and should be burned to the ground"". This implies that there have been reports of the ""horrifying"" variety in the past.  Cueball promises that it is a normal one but it turns out that the server crashes when a user's password is a resolvable URL, which implies that the server is in some way attempting to resolve passwords as if they were URLs. A resolvable URL is one that is syntactically correct and refers to a find-able and accessible resource on the internet (i.e. does not return a 404 error or equivalent when resolved). Therefore a resolvable URL is a fully qualified domain name or a valid ip address that points to a valid server, and it can optionally specify a resource that exists on that server. Normally there is no reason for a system to treat a password as if it were a URL.  Also, Cueball specifically states that the server is crashing, rather than his application. While this could be an example of misused terminology on the part of Cueball or Randall, given Cueball's history (for example causing the most basic console commands to fail in 1084: Server Problem or other tech issues as seen in 1586: Keyboard Problems) his choice of terms is probably accurate. In the context of web services the server refers to either the computer itself or the program that responds to web requests and executes the user's (i.e. Cueball's) application. Cueball would be in charge of building the application. The importance of this distinction is that a typical system has safe guards in place at many levels to prevent a misbehaving application from crashing anything other than itself. So for his application to crash the server (either the computer itself or the server software hosting his application) would require his application to be operating in a way far outside of the norm, which has been the case for Cueball in previous comics. Alternatively, the project might include its own server software without the safeguards. In either case it is clear that Cueball's issue is far from normal, for which reason the off-panel person gives up and decides that burning the project to the ground is the only solution, telling Cueball I'll get the lighter fluid.  In the title text another two issues with Cueball's program are mentioned, together with a possible solution that would fix all three problems at once. The second problem is a unicode-handling bug in the URL request library, and the third is that the passwords are stored unsalted. The proposed solution is to salt the passwords with emoji (unicode, multi-byte characters), which is claimed to solve all three issues at once. Salting passwords means that random characters are added to the password before it is cryptographically-secured and stored in the database. Salting increases security in the event that the database is compromised by ensuring that users with the same password will not have the same password hash. This makes some attacks that can be used to crack hash databases, such as rainbow tables, effectively impossible.  Salting passwords with emoji can potentially ""fix"" these bugs in different ways. First, emoji and other unicode characters are not valid characters in URLs. As a result the salted-passwords will no longer be resolvable URLs. This will presumably circumvent (but not actually fix) the bug that causes the server to crash. In addition, the passwords will now be salted, increasing security. There is no obvious way that this would actually fix a unicode-handling bug in the URL request library. Given Cueball's general approach to problems like this, the best explanation is probably that he hasn't ""fixed"" the bug but rather that it is no longer a bug because he is relying on its behavior to help fix these other issues, i.e. the classic it's not a bug, it's a feature.  The title text shows that his general approach to problems is not to actually fix bugs but to work around them and even rely on them for other behavior. This approach to software development makes for terrible code, which is likely how Cueball got into this trouble in the first place. Therefore the title text shows that he still has yet to learn from his mistakes, further supporting the suggestion to just burn the whole thing down.  Given that this comic comes only five comics after 1695: Code Quality 2 it seems likely that the off-panel person is Ponytail and as could be seen in the first of those two comics, 1513: Code Quality, the perpetrator is indeed Cueball. In the title text of the first, using emoji in variable names is mentioned. Emoji has since then become a recurrent theme on xkcd.  In 1349: Shouldn't Be Hard Cueball is also programming and finding it very difficult, although he thinks it should be easy. An off-panel person suggests burning the computer down with a blowtorch, much like the off-panel person in this one suggests burning the whole project (including the computer) to the ground with lighter fluid. In the next comic, with multiple storylines 1350: Lorenz, one story line results in a computer being burned with a blow torch.","[Cueball sits at his desk in front of his computer leaning back and turning away from it to speak to a person off-panel.] Cueball: Can you take a look at the bug I just opened?

The person speaking to him is still of panel even though this panel is much broader.] Off-panel voice: Is this a normal bug, or one of those horrifying ones that prove your whole project is broken beyond repair and should be burned to the ground?

1718: Backups,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1718:_Backups,computers,Maybe you should keep FEWER backups; it sounds like throwing away everything you've done and starting from scratch might not be the worst idea.,"On his laptop, Cueball explores a cyclic path along which his files are being copied from storage to storage. His laptop (presumably the one he is on) is sending its files to a server, which sends its files to another server, which in turn syncs back a certain selection of files to his laptop. Cueball determines that this setup leads to an exponential growth, implying that each node in the cycle simply copies files over to the next without any effort to avoid duplicates. Indeed, each time a set of files completes a full cycle, duplicates of the same files are propagated.  Moore's Law is an observation in computer engineering (made by engineer Gordon Moore in 1965) that states that the number of transistors we can fit in a chip will double approximately every two years. Cueball, who was rather alarmed, calms down when he realizes that the exponential growth of his backup is slower than that of Moore's Law. He reasons that as long as he keeps at the forefront of information storage, he will never run out of room. Assuming available disk capacity is proportional to number of transistors (this is roughly true for solid-state disks) or otherwise keeps pace with Moore's Law, this would imply it takes more than two years for his files to completely propagate through two servers and back to his laptop enough times to double in size (implying either an extremely slow transfer or an extremely weird backup system).  The phrase ""[this is] why we can't have nice things"" is often used in response to incidents where someone abuses a well-meaning feature, with the abuse ultimately wiping out any benefits the feature was supposed to bring. In the comic, the person off-screen is commenting on the fact that Cueball is not using advances in storage capacity in a responsible manner. That is, rather than using the increased capacity to store more useful information, he is simply using it as a workaround to avoid having to make his backup strategy more efficient.  This concept is further expanded upon in the title text when somebody, presumably the off-screen speaker, notes that Cueball may be better off taking fewer backups in the hopes of losing some data. Typically backups are taken in the hopes of not losing programs and data. However, if the inefficient backup solution presented is representative of the other things Cueball has created, it may be better to have it all be lost and in effect force it to be re-created in a hopefully superior way.  There are some similarities to the Cueball who owns the computer in the 1700: New Bug and maybe also to the Code Quality series: 1513: Code Quality and 1695: Code Quality 2, where Cueball speaks with Ponytail.","[Cueball] is sitting in an office chair at his desk, working on his laptop.] Cueball: Wait.

1722: Debugging,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1722:_Debugging,computers,"When you Google an error message and it gets no results, you can be pretty sure you've found a clue to the location of Martin's sword.","Cueball is telling White Hat about his attempt at debugging, i.e. the process of finding out what is wrong with a given computer problem, which can become increasingly difficult and convoluted. In this case, Cueball had a problem with his browser. His attempts to solve this problem led him to a problem with the device driver for his keyboard. Chasing that issue, he found an unclear error message from a system utility, and so on.  Cueball decides to ""make a long story short"" by skipping several steps he believes are boring, and he unexpectedly reveals this process has led him to find the “Sword of Martin the Warrior”, a legendary relic from the children's fantasy novel series Redwall. This refers to the fact that a complicated riddled path was devised in the series that would lead to the sword, which is similar to the process of debugging, as it involves following clues to achieve an answer. But apart from that, they are entirely different. This is pointed out by White Hat who states that at some point in the process he switched from the puzzle of debugging to the Redwall puzzle of finding Martin's sword. Redwall has been referenced before, most prominently in 370: Redwall; where Martin and the sword can be seen; but also in 1286: Encryptic and more recently in 1688: Map Age Guide.  Googling an error message is a common method used during debugging, often leading to useful information. However, when there are no search results for a given message, it means the problem is so obscure that almost nobody had experienced it before. (See also 979: Wisdom of the Ancients about getting only one result.) Or, as the title text hints, it might mean it was a hidden clue to the location of Martin’s sword.","[Cueball and White Hat are walking, while Cueball holds a hand out while talking.] Cueball: I was trying to figure out why my browser was acting weird.  [In a frame-less panel they keep in walking, Cueball holds both hands up in front of him.] Cueball: Turns out it wasn't the browser-the issue was with my keyboard driver.

[Zoom out as Cueball holds up a miniature sword by the blade in one hand. White Hat turns his head around and looks at it while they keep walking.] Cueball: Anyway, long story short, I found the sword of Martin the Warrior.

1727: Number of Computers,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1727:_Number_of_Computers,computers,"They try to pad their numbers in the annual reports by counting Galileo's redundant systems as multiple computers, but they're falling behind badly either way.","This comic shows a semi-log plot with two red lines. The first line shows the increasing rate that computers have been created since the first came around in the 1940s. The graph shows this to occur around 1946. (The precise date can be discussed but it was around that time that the concept began to be applied to real working machines.) After the first computer, the number of computers created is shown to increase in a roughly straight line, indicating exponential growth. At the time of this comic's release in 2016, the curve has passed 10 billion computers, and its projection into the 2020s predicts that the number of computers will keep rising exponentially for at least 10 years to come.  The other plot on this graph represents all the computers destroyed by throwing them into Jupiter. So far this has only worked for the computers on two space probes: those on the Galileo orbiter and its probe. The latter's mission was to fly into Jupiter so it went first in 1995; the orbiter went only after it had completed its mission in 2003. That constitutes the first two steps on the graph.   Recently the Juno space probe entered into orbit (as only the second after Galileo), and that was celebrated with 1703: Juno on xkcd. Juno's main mission has hardly begun yet; as at the time of this comic's release, it is not even in its final orbit. But once its mission is completed, it will also crash into Jupiter thus destroying a third computer. This is shown as the third step, but this section is shown with a dotted line, as the destruction may still fail if NASA loses contact with the probe before giving it the order to deorbit into Jupiter. This is scheduled to occur in 2018. All three steps on the graph fits with these years. (Note the number of computers created is not drawn with a dotted line into the future, probably because Randall believes this continued increase in numbers of computers to be quite certain over the next 10-20 years, whereas the outcome of a space probe mission is never certain, even when the probe is already in orbit and only 1½ years before scheduled deorbit!)  Space probes sent to Jupiter are typically scheduled to deorbit and fall into Jupiter's atmosphere. There can be several reasons for this, but one very important reason is to avoid contaminating Jupiter's moons with Earth pathogens, especially the four Galilean moons including Europa which may harbor life. Also the huge gravity well of Jupiter that would have to be overcome for such a probe to leave the planet again makes it impossible to have an orbiting probe return to Earth with samples.  The caption below the comic humorously implies that NASA's reasons for causing the probes to deorbit into Jupiter is merely an attempt to destroy all the computers of the world. The caption notes that they are failing horribly, given that they have destroyed only three computers out of more than 10 billion. However, due to the semi-log scale, those three computers appear to have more significance than they actually have. The caption states that NASA really needs to pick up the pace (having only destroyed two since the 1940s, when computers were created), if they wish to actually finish the job of destroying all computers by hurling them into Jupiter. In addition, seeing as there have been many computers destroyed by other means, NASA will never actually catch up, no matter how hard they try, making this statistic even more irrelevant.  Destroying unwanted objects by hurling them into Jupiter pokes fun at the common science fiction trope of destroying objects by hurling them into the Sun [1].  Hurling objects into the Sun is in fact extremely difficult because of the need to cancel out the orbital velocity of the earth.  Randall may be referencing calculations ([2], see item 11) that show that hurling items into Jupiter requires 38% less energy than hurling them into the Sun.  The title text continues the caption by mentioning that in NASA's annual reports they try to make their numbers look better by counting the redundant computer systems on Galileo and its probe, thus doubling the numbers of destroyed computers to four. This of course makes no big difference given the exponential growth of computer production, which is also noted. This indicates that this is a top priority for NASA. That NASA might try to make themselves look better in a report by doubling a number could be realistic, presumably for political reasons or to get better funding.","[A graph with two red lines.

1728: Cron Mail,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1728:_Cron_Mail,computers,"Take THAT, piece of 1980s-era infrastructure I've inexplicably maintained on my systems for 15 years despite never really learning how it works.","On Unix-like systems, cron is a system utility that runs tasks on a schedule.  This program has been around since the early days of Unix and has not changed much - it is still one of the most widely used functions in modern operating systems.  Many administrative tasks on servers are automated using cron, including monitoring and updates.  When a cron job produces output, cron's default behavior is to send an email to the user account under which the job ran.  However, in most situations, an email address has not been set up for that user, so the email is instead written to a mailbox file.  Most Unix shells will notify the user with a message like ""You have new mail"" when this mailbox file is updated, but if the user doesn't know how to check this mail file, they will likely just ignore the message.  In this case, Cueball has been ignoring his mailbox for fifteen years.  When he finally learns where to look, he discovers more than a gigabyte worth of messages from the cron program, the vast majority of which are likely meaningless.  Ponytail suggests that Cueball ""fix your cron"" (likely meaning to fix the task that's generating the output so that it doesn't do so), then set a parameter that tells cron to send email to an address he actually checks.  (He could also opt to direct the mails to /dev/null, which would discard them, or simply disable the mail in the crontab.)  Cueball, however, interprets the tremendous amount of email as spam and decides to redirect the emails to /etc/crontab, the main configuration file that contains all of cron's scheduling information.  He apparently believes that this will either stop the emails or cause cron to spam itself instead.  In reality, this will not cause significant problems as the MAILTO environmental variable in cron takes an email address or usernames on the local system and attempts to send emails to them.  It will not write or append output to a local file like /etc/crontab.  Thus when cron attempts to email /etc/crontab the mail program cron uses will generate an error saying it can't find the user /etc/crontab.   For example, if you create the following crontab:  installed on a user named me on a system called mycomputer then you will see a new error messages email to you (located in /var/mail/me) stating it can't send email to a user named /etc/crontab and the undelivered email is being returned to the sender.  The error email will look like the following:    The title text shows that Cueball is somewhat aware of what cron does, including the fact that it's existed pretty much unchanged for several decades, but he hasn't bothered to really get into understanding it, treating it more as a foe to vanquish rather than as a tool to understand and use.","[Cueball is sitting at a table in an office chair working on his laptop. Ponytail walks up to him.] Cueball: I've been getting these ""You have new mail"" UNIX notifications for like 15 years, but I've never bothered to figure out what it's talking about.

1737: Datacenter Scale,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1737:_Datacenter_Scale,computers,"Asimov's Cosmic AC was created by linking all datacenters through hyperspace, which explains a lot. It didn't reverse entropy--it just discarded the universe when it reached end-of-life and ordered a new one.","This comic expands, to the limit, the strategy that it's a net cost saving to allow cheap hardware to fail and simply replace it than to have robust but much more expensive systems to start with. The technique was made famous by Google circa 1999, when its successful cost-effective server designs were actually using sub-consumer, nearly junk, hardware.   RAID (""redundant array of independent disks"") is a technology that splits data across several hard drives as if they were one. RAID comes in several levels (varieties) which have different applications, but one of the big applications of RAID is creating mirrored hard disks that back each other up. If one disk drive in such a RAID fails, no data is lost.  However, RAID is complicated to configure, so you don't want to be constantly setting it up. An alternative technique for data centers is, therefore, to simply send the data to several servers at once. This makes maintenance easier, but without RAID, one hard disk crash basically breaks the server. However, this is what the woman with a bun's (possibly an adult Science Girl) data center is doing since their scale is so large that fixing individual servers actually more expensive than simply buying a new one for replacement, and instead of fixing the drive they throw away the machine. (More about this approach will be explained later on)  From here, the comic starts to exaggerate. Nowadays, servers can be made extremely small (""Blade servers"") and dozens of servers can be attached to one 19-inch rack in a data center. Rather than going to the effort of unplugging and unscrewing one blade from the rack, when a blade fails at Cueball's data center they just throw away the rack, and Ponytail agrees and mildly mocks the woman with a bun for replacing one server.  Hairy's data center goes one step further - they have so many servers that they would constantly have to be throwing away and replacing racks, so instead they just build a new room when one rack fails. This would be currently possible with small modular data centers that are built in shipping containers for easy transport and can be linked together to expand capacity.  Here the cargo-container ""room"" with the failure would be quickly swapped with a fresh one.  Cueball adds ""like Google!"" - Randall previously mentioned Google's approach to hard drive failures in the what if? Google's Datacenters on Punch Cards. Back in 2007 they had one failure every few minutes, which might have increased hugely since then.  Finally Megan appears and her company, of course, breaks the scale of silliness in exaggeration. She says that they don't have any fire extinguishers (neither regular sprinklers nor the systems that deploy gasses like FM-200 which alter the room air's ability to sustain a fire). Rather, they just rope the center off, thus letting the data center burn down. Then they simply move a town over and build a new one. This may indicate they are so big that the entire town will burn down if their center catches fire, for else they did not have to skip town. Alternatively, they just leave the center burning and this may cause problems in that town, so they simply flee the premises.   Most big internet companies do have multiple redundant data centers around the world, in order to increase speeds for users in different countries, but Megan's idea would be very expensive, result in increased latency, possibly kill people (either in their company, or other people in the town and since they do not try to put out the fire), and cause severe destruction of properties in addition to their own.  These last two items would result in additional litigation and fines, and potentially jail sentences for the people charged with implementing the policy.  They may also result in other towns being unwilling to take their business, out of fear they will wind up burning too.  Hairy still thinks that it makes sense, while Cueball wonders what difference the roping off does. This could again be a reference to the fact that they just let the buildings burn without bothering about the local consequences, and the next step is just one more step towards the extreme of the title text.   This comic references how, as data requirements expand, the cost of time eventually outweighs the cost of hardware at ever increasing scales (drive, rack, room, building). While this comic takes this to the extreme, with whole buildings being destroyed for simple flaws, the concept is not as far-fetched as it seems if ""thrown out"" is taken to include being sold to equipment refurbishers.  It could indeed be cost effective for a large data services provider to resell racks or even whole data center modules at some significant fraction of their ""as new"" price as opposed expending the time and effort to attempt a repair.  The equipment refurbisher would then rely on a cost advantage like cheaper labor to repair the flaw and sell it back to Google or another company with less demanding requirements.  Equipment rental firms already operate on this model and with the added incentive customers preferring to rent newer models, this means that the equipment is often preemptively replaced before failures even occur.    The title text refers to Isaac Asimov's science-fiction short story The Last Question (comic version), where humanity asks, at different stages of its spatial and technological development, the same question to increasingly advanced computers: ""How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?"". At each point, the computer's answer is that it does not yet have sufficient data for a meaningful answer. Ultimately, the computers are all linked through hyperspace, outside the physical boundaries of the universe, and make up a single computing entity named AC which keeps pondering the question even as the heat death of the universe occurs and time and space cease to exist. When AC finally discovers the answer, since there is nobody left to report it to, it decides to demonstrate it and says ""LET THERE BE LIGHT!"", which are the first words said by God during the Creation, according to the Book of Genesis. Here, the title text implies that, as the universe died, AC no longer had a use for it as a physical support and, taking the comic's logic to the next extreme, chose to discard it and get a brand-new one instead of bothering to ""fix"" it by reversing its entropy. This short story was also referenced in 1448: Question.  This comic's concept of taking a real world phenomenon and exaggerating it to levels currently considered implausible for comic effect closely mimics an earlier comic which describes progressively more ""hardcore"" programmers in 378: Real Programmers. This comic might be related to 1567: Kitchen Tips which suggests not throwing away your dishes but washing them.","[Zoom in on a woman with a bun holding her hand palm up in front of her taking to people off-panel right.] Woman with a bun: RAID controllers don't make sense at our scale; everything is redundant at higher levels.

We throw away whole racks at a time. Ponytail: Yeah, who replaces one server?

1739: Fixing Problems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1739:_Fixing_Problems,computers,"What was the original problem you were trying to fix?' 'Well, I noticed one of the tools I was using had an inefficiency that was wasting my time.'","Due to the complex relationships within a program or other system, making an alteration can cause problems with other parts of the program. This can lead to a seemingly small ""fix"" becoming a long chain of debugging and consecutive fixes, which Cueball is in the middle of, a typical example of recursion often used in xkcd. As Cueball attempts to solve the initial computer issue, he creates more problems along the way. So he should have followed the golden rule: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  The title text suggests that the original problem was not stopping the function of the program and the benefits that Cueball may have hoped to achieve with the mentality of ""If it ain't broke, break it and fix it"" are being consumed by the expanding effort of the fix.  Attempting to solve all of these problems results in more time wasted than he hoped would be gained by optimizing the inefficient tool described in the title text. Though depending on the tool, he could publish the changes once completed, allowing the community using that tool to gain back the man-hours collectively. Wondering if something is worth doing has been a subject in 1205: Is It Worth the Time?  This comic is similar in thesis to 1445: Efficiency and 1319: Automation. Other relevant comics include 1171: Perl Problems, where using regular expressions causes more problems than it solves, 349: Success, where Randall comments on the goals of a project decreasing in optimism as a project goes on due to more and more problems distracting from the original, and 1579: Tech Loops, which shows that attempting to fix one problem in a piece of software can force a developer to delve into seemingly irrelevant parts of the relevant tech loop that the software in question is trapped in.",[Cueball sitting in an office chair at his desk typing on his laptop.

1760: TV Problems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1760:_TV_Problems,computers,"Certified skydiving instructors know way more about safely falling from planes than I do, and are way more likely to die that way.","In this comic, Cueball has broken his computer's software so much that he is unable to ""turn on the news"" as requested by White Hat. Since his computer is not working at all, he is using the next best thing to download a fix: his smartphone, via a CD. This is probably one of two things:   He later states that even that first step of mending won't be enough to display the news, as his computer's state is so bad that being able to send information to the TV screen is just the first step of debugging. In the last panel, he tells White Hat that his computer science degree just helps him understand how he ended up with such a terrible situation, but did not give him enough foresight to prevent the most unexpected issues. The title text clarifies this statement with a similar problem- when things start to go horribly wrong while falling from a plane, certified skydiving instructors will be able to better understand why and how bad the situation is, but won't be able to do anything if their usual tools have failed them. Besides, while they are less likely to make a fatal mistake on a given flight and fall, they are more likely to make one in their life, because of the far greater number of attempts. This is especially true considering most people never attempt a jump in their lives, giving them absolutely zero probability of dying in a skydiving accident. This also resembles 795: Conditional Risk: the more informed a person is, the more likely this person is to suffer from the issue they know about.  Computers breaking in unexpected ways, and somewhat weird solutions to computer problems seems to be a thing with Cueball - and probably Randall as well. At that point, you might assume he probably enjoys it. In 1586: Keyboard Problems, he also had a problem involving both software and hardware. 1739: Fixing Problems could very well apply to this comic; Cueball may have ended with this situation while trying to correct a simple problem (eg: channels in the wrong order), and just made the situation worse every step of the way. In 456: Cautionary, he teaches his cousin about breakfixing a computer.  [1] In this instance Cueball has his single tasking phone busy while he downloads to it and cannot interrupt what he's doing just to use the phone as a remote for the TV, although it appears more that the TV is one of the things he is trying to fix.","[Cueball is sitting by his TV, holding his phone, when White Hat walks in.] White Hat: Hey, turn on the news. Cueball (Sitting on the floor in front of a computer holding a cell phone): Can't. Downloading a CD onto my phone.  White Hat (off-screen): Why? Cueball: So I can use it to fix my computer's operating system enough that I can teach it to talk to my TV screen.  White Hat: But then you'll be able to watch the news? Cueball: (off-screen): No.  White Hat: Don't you have a computer science degree? Cueball: That just means I understand how everything went so wrong."
1764: XKCDE,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1764:_XKCDE,computers,4. They unplug the root machine but the thousands of leaf VMs scatter in the wind and start spinning up new instances wherever they land,"Randall has created a theoretical software environment named XKCDE (a portmanteau on xkcd and CDE (Collaborative Development Environment)), which relies on the user creating a series of nested virtual machines inside each other (creating sort of a digital version of the Droste effect), which would likely cause extreme strain on the resources of the machine running it. This strain is explained in 676: Abstraction, at least for the normal case.  ""Virtual Machines"" are software which pretend to be PC hardware so that a ""guest"" operating system can run inside of them, under a ""host"" operating system. Nesting VMs is the process of making a guest also be a host to yet another guest. Generally this is considered wasteful of resources, especially beyond one or two layers deep, and is not done except in a test lab for very specific purposes.  ""Containers"" are a lighter form of PC abstraction. Instead of emulating the entire physical hardware, they only emulate the software stack sitting on top of the kernel. A containerisation tool will have its own standard library, software-stack and installed programs, but delegates all system calls to the host kernel. This is more efficient because no hardware needs to be emulated, but the disadvantage is reduced isolation between host and guest. A misbehaving guest can induce kernel crashes that take the host with them. The most well-known example of container software is Docker.  Randall derives humour from repeating the nesting ad absurdum in a never-ending fractal of nested VMs, thus trapping the follower of the instruction forever, in a form of Nerd Sniping: Any external observer, such as your boss, who sees you doing this is likely to fire you for wasting company time (An outcome which is undesirable, though still better than being hit by a truck)(citation needed). [1]  A software environment which disables both the machine it runs on and the user that runs it could be thought of as a useless machine.  The title-text is a joke on the words root and leaf as used in abstract data structures, drawing an analogy of cutting down a tree (unplugging the root machine) scattering leaves (the nested VMs). A subtle pun is hidden in 'spinning': several tree species use spinning leaves to scatter their seeds. The autorotation due to the special shape of the leaves helps the seeds travel farther on the wind from their parent tree.  Randall mixes this meaning of 'spinning' with the act of ""spinning up a VM"", the colloquial phrasing for starting up a new instance of a guest virtual machine. As a seed grows into a new tree where it lands, so apparently do the scattered VMs spin up new instances of themselves wherever they land.  In this case, a literal interpretation would be that turning off the computer the VMs are running on would make all the VMs without any VMs running in them propagate themselves through a network and install themselves on other computers, which at the end of the day would be a very inefficient method of creating a virus.  In 'normal' software development, spinning up a (single, non-nested) VM is a practice to ensure that the development environment is identical between developers, thus minimising hard-to-reproduce bugs due to local machine differences, such as unmatching library versions, locale settings or additional installed or missing software. The single VM image is shared between all developers, who each spin up their own instance on their personal workstation. In such cases, spinning up the VM is the first step in bringing up a local development environment, after which additional steps will usually instruct which programs to open, which configuration settings to change, etc.  Someone got 4 levels deep with this.

1765: Baby Post,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1765:_Baby_Post,computers,"[bzzzt] ""REMEMBER TO CHECK IN FOR YOUR FLIGHT TO LONDON."" ""My wha-"" [bzzzt] ""YOUR UBER WILL ARRIVE IN FOUR MINUTES.""","In this comic, Cueball is questioned about a series of posts made to his Facebook account.  Initially he explains the posts as the result of leaving his daughter (a baby, according to the title) unattended with his tablet.  Readers are meant to assume all posts were made by accident, which happens often to people with children.  This makes sense for the first two panels: sharing the same video six times could be the result of the child repeatedly hitting the same area of the screen (e.g. a ""share"" link), and the gibberish text ""FHFF,,,M,,,,"" could be due to the child randomly tapping on the screen as well, all without knowing what she has done.  The joke begins when Cueball discovers an apparent pattern in new posts, starting with a map of hardware stores and culminating in blueprints for the Tower of London.  These subjects, if they were chosen consciously by an adult, would strongly suggest the poster was planning a heist to steal the crown jewels.  It is very unlikely for a baby to be capable of designing and carrying out such a plan. [citation needed]  However, it is also very unlikely for these specific subjects to be posted all by accident.  The reader is thus left wondering what could have caused these posts, and whether Cueball and/or his daughter might know more than they let on.  Cueball's suggestion of ""keeping an eye"" on his daughter suggests he is seriously considering the possibility that she might be an evil genius.  The title text continues the joke by notifying Cueball that his flight to London is leaving soon, and an Uber driver is coming to pick him up. Since his daughter was using the tablet and he is surprised by the messages, this suggests she is in fact the mastermind who has already started executing her plan.  Either she is making the journey herself (and Cueball is only receiving notifications because he has the same accounts linked to his phone), or Cueball is being roped into the crime.  The crown jewels are famous in several movies for being overly complicated to steal, such as Minions. They are also mentioned in 1698: Theft Quadrants.  The comic is similar to 1419: On the Phone, though here it seems that the daughter isn't just a cover story. It is also somewhat similar to 576: Packages, in that Cueball seems weirder since it started.  [Ponytail is looking at something on her phone while talking to Cueball]  [Cueball is talking to someone on the phone while pushing a shopping cart with a few items in it]  [White Hat is holding his phone while walking with Cueball]  [Ponytail is looking at her phone while talking to Cueball]","Ponytail: Why did you post a The Wheels on the Bus Youtube video to Facebook six times? Cueball: Haha, whoops! My daughter was watching the tablet and must have hit something.  Phone: Hey, did you mean to post ""FHFF,,,M,,,,"" and a link to a map of hardware stores? Cueball: I should really look up how to lock the screen.  White Hat: You just posted videos on metal-working, zip lines, and camouflage. Cueball: Uhh...  Ponytail: Um, you posted blueprints of the Crown Jewel rooms in the Tower of London. Cueball: Maybe we should be keeping more of an eye on her."
1782: Team Chat,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1782:_Team_Chat,computers,2078: He announces that he's finally making the jump from screen+irssi to tmux+weechat.,"Randall provides us with a – presumably anecdotal – montage of the Internet's changing attitude towards different instant messaging protocols, framed within the context of a team trying to remain in communication while tolerating each others' different tastes.  Although one-on-one ""talk"" programs date back to 1960s mainframes, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was one of the first real-time group communication protocols, invented in 1988. While it remains the format on which most later apps were based, the convenience and accessibility of other protocols such as AIM and Skype gradually exceeded IRC in popularity. Many users took to the new environments, but others preferred the old and familiar, hence schisms between groups began to grow.  Skype and Slack are both proprietary centralized communication protocols (usually used through their official clients). Skype focuses mainly on voice communication, be it for personal or business use, and own installable client, while Slack relies almost entirely on text communication, focuses on work communication and works completely well in its own web client, even though official desktop and mobile clients are available as well. Slack also features a huge customizability (bots, plugins) possibly inspired by IRC, and its users need to create communication teams, working inside subdomains at *.slack.com. It is possible to connect to Slack via IRC as well, using a gateway feature, if allowed by the team's admin.  Randall here seems to be commenting on the persistence of IRC; while generally considered to be ancient software in comparison to newer and still-competing protocols, its endless customizability has led some people to support it above all others.   Extrapolating for the sake of humor, the joke here lies in a particularly uncommon but memorable type of Internet denizen: even in a far-off distant future where the world's technology has led to a superlative messaging network encompassing all people in some supposed, incredible bliss, there is always - in Randall's vision - going to be That IRC Guy. This might also be a reference to the scenarios in science fiction stories such as Isaac Asimov's concept of Galaxia in the Foundation novels, or the concept of a merged human-computer intelligence as in The Last Question. [1], the concept of which is most notably highlighted by this line:  [...] One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain. [...]  In the title text, both screen and tmux are unix programs that help you multitask while working in terminal, and irssi and weechat are both communication clients supporting mainly IRC, capable of working in a terminal environment. Tmux is a newer and apparently more user-friendly project, complete with handy menus and titles, while screen is something of an industry standard, but relatively difficult to use – you need to know what you are doing or read help before use, otherwise you get lost and frustrated. [2] The same it is with the newer, more feature-packed and user-friendly weechat vs industry-standard, harder-to-use irssi. [3]  Basically, that one guy is a hardcore UNIX geek who doesn't use any graphical user interface, and in 2078 he still chooses to use terminal-emulation-based tools.  Timing of this strip follows the release of irssi version 1.0.0.  Randall has touched on similar themes before in 927: Standards.","[Hairbun holding up her palm toward Cueball.

1785: Wifi,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1785:_Wifi,computers,"Further out to the right, it works correctly, but the reason it works still involves the word 'firmware.'","This comic shows the supposed probability that a guest will be able to connect to the owner's Wi-Fi in graph form. Connecting to a new Wi-Fi network is a fairly simple operation that most people can perform, typically only requiring selecting the correct network name on a settings screen, then entering a password.  The graph starts with tech-illiterate people who don't even know how to control their Wi-Fi connection (""can't find wifi settings""). This group has slightly lower than normal probability of connecting successfully, since they would not know what to do if left alone. However, they still have a reasonable chance to connect as long as someone is available to help them. Once the initial setup is done, they can continue using the connection without any technical knowledge or intervention.  The average case in the middle of the graph represents typical users who simply wish to connect and gain Internet access (""works fine""). This group of users have enough knowledge to be able to connect and are then satisfied with the connection just working. Since networking devices use a standard protocol to communicate behind the scenes, users typically will not experience any issues.  Finally, the large drop in the graph on the right-hand side is explained by ""something involving the word 'firmware'"". Firmware is programming which operates a device at the lowest level, typically stored in a ROM or an EEPROM/flash. Both Wi-Fi routers and guest's devices (smartphones, tablets, computers) have firmware. Modifying the firmware can have certain benefits, for example to gain features that aren't included in the base product. Also, especially for newly adopted wireless standards (such as, most recently, IEEE 802.11ac), incompatible interpretations of the standard may prevent devices from different manufacturers from communicating reliably or at full speed, requiring firmware changes to patch the issues. However, working with firmware requires a great deal of technical knowledge, and can be quite risky for people without experience. Not all custom firmware will interoperate correctly with all devices. Technical issues with custom firmware can also be harder to fix due to lack of support from the device manufacturer. In the worst case, installing the wrong firmware, or any errors or glitches in the process, can even leave devices bricked. It's likely that the sharp dropoff in the graph is caused by inexperienced users who know ""just enough"" to want to modify their firmware, but don't know how to deal with the multitude of issues that can arise. Particularly for users whose connection was already working fine but nevertheless want to experiment with new firmware, their changes often end up worsening their chances of connecting.  The title text indicates that the curve recovers once users are more experienced, and can consistently install firmware correctly to get a working connection. In such case, the users are able to enjoy better connections through their firmware changes while avoiding their pitfalls. These experienced users are often able to diagnose and fix connection issues through the appropriate use of firmware, making their chances of connecting even better than the average user.  Randall has previously used the title text to add extra info that would not fit in the main graph.  This has happened in 388: Fuck Grapefruit, 1242: Scary Names, and 1501: Mysteries. The first two have extra data points mentioned there because they are far off the chart, whereas the last has a point whose description would be too long to fit on the chart.   Computer issues have previously appeared in several xkcd comics, notably 456: Cautionary, where WiFi problems specifically are mentioned in the title text.  The apparent paradox of people knowing more about a subject also having more problems with it is also explored in 1760: TV Problems.","[A line graph with a curve that starts just right of the Y-axis above the middle of the axis.

1805: Unpublished Discoveries,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1805:_Unpublished_Discoveries,computers,"If you must know, I'm currently researching how to save this emailed tax form as a regular PDF so I can print and sign it. Our work isn't a lock for the Nobel, but we're in the running.","This is not the first time Ponytail asks Megan if she is working on some groundbreaking research project: Back in 1067: Pressures, Ponytail was probing Megan about her work, since, as hinted by the caption of that comic, Megan is a Swiss patent clerk just like Albert Einstein. Ponytail thus assumes she has the same potential to produce Nobel-Prize-worthy work as him. While there is no clear indication that this comic should be a continuation of that comic or that Megan is a patent clerk, Ponytail still assumes Megan is on her way to a Nobel Prize - but that Megan is just not yet ready to announce her discovery to the public for one reason or another.  In the first two panels, Ponytail is referring to the general issue that, to publish a discovery on a scientific topic, it can take a very long time, especially when the discovery is ""Nobel-Prize-worthy"". Obviously the first step is for the researcher to demonstrate rigor by more supporting experiments (see 397: Unscientific), plus summarize the discovery into the format accepted by the journal the paper is submitted too. The latter can take considerable time by itself, especially if the first journal the paper is submitted to declines publication. Because other journals chosen afterwards may have a completely different layout (for instance in physics, the journal with the greatest impact factor is Nature, then followed by for instance Science and then Physical Review Letters. All three have very different layouts regarding format and figures etc. Thus the paper may need to be submitted to various journals until one accepts, which may also take a few months, and even when accepted it can take anywhere from 25 days to 150+ days just for the paper to be processed through the publishing system due to various reasons, including the nature of the publishing process, reviewers assigning extra work as conditions for acceptance, or even formatting problems. This has prompted researchers to come up with some interesting work-arounds.   In the title text, Megan claims that she is actually just trying to convert an emailed tax form to a PDF. This could of course just be to ward of any further attempts by Ponytail to spy on her ""real"" Nobel-worthy work. Megan sarcastically states that her conversion of tax forms is in the running for a Nobel Prize, perhaps because she considers it an incredibly difficult task (even for these things that should not be hard - see 1349: Shouldn't Be Hard). While this could be true, this task is in no way connected to any kind of scientific endeavor, and as a result could never be considered for any kind of Nobel Prize. That the task is so difficult is though officially acknowledged by the IRS as they themselves note that saving and printing their Online tax forms could be tricky. Quote:  The months and weeks before April 15th (this comic was released on March 1st), is the ""tax season"" in the US so Americans are in the process of completing their tax forms, which is why this comic is timely. Given the US tax code is complained by many to be too complex, it is possible for researchers to delay publication of their discoveries to deal with their tax returns first. This can cause people to ""sit on their discovery"" for a while, although hopefully not as long as the task of publishing itself.","[Ponytail walks up to Megan, who is sitting in an office chair at a desk using her laptop.] Ponytail: When you make a big scientific discovery, it takes a while to get it published.  Ponytail: Right? Megan: Mm hmm.  [Zoom-in on Ponytail.] Ponytail: So there are probably several research teams out there who are sitting on Nobel-Prize-worthy discoveries, but haven't told the rest of us yet. Megan (off-panel): Makes sense.  [Ponytail leans over the desk, trying to see Megan's laptop screen from behind it.]  [Ponytail leans further. Megan pulls the screen down so Ponytail cannot see it.] Ponytail: Sooo... What are you working on? Megan: It isn't me! Ponytail: I promise I won't tell. Megan: Shoo! Go bother someone else."
1806: Borrow Your Laptop,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1806:_Borrow_Your_Laptop,computers,"If used with software that could keep up, a scroll wheel mapped to send a stream of 'undo' and 'redo' events could be kind of cool.","White Hat asks to borrow Cueball's laptop to view something (possibly a website). Cueball permits this, but immediately begins rattling off a list of very unusual key- and mouse-bindings that he has applied to the device. In the caption, Randall states that he himself tends to continually re-configure computers that he owns in weird ways, eventually rendering it unusable or at least unpleasant to use for others.  Of the three items in Cueball's list of customizations only the first and half of the second seems like a real and relevant changes.  At first he has programmed the computer so that hitting both shift keys simultaneously will change the keyboard back to QWERTY. The QWERTY keyboard is the standard in the US (as well as some other places using the roman alphabet). This implies that Cueball prefers a different keyboard layout, (most likely the Dvorak keyboard layout, see trivia), but doesn't need the printed letters to match up with those of the laptop. Cueball would have to make a special customization to make pressing the two shift key trigger this shift (see trivia). Presumably Cueball can later return to this favorite layout by pressing the shift keys again.   Cueball tells, in the first part of the second point on the list, that he has changed his keyboard layout so that capslock acts as the control key (Ctrl). Swapping capslock and control is a common thing to do in the world of computer freaks on Unix or for users of the Emacs editor. The ""Caps Lock"" key (immediately to the left of the ""A"" in a traditional layout) is much easier to reach for a touch typist than the more out-of-the-way ""Ctrl"", and the latter is often used more frequently, especially by programmers.   But the second part where Cueball says he has then moved capslock so that it is activated when hitting the spacebar makes no sense. It is quite impractical, as the spacebar is the largest key and it will not gain anything from being used for anything other than spaces, especially not a rarely used key that locks into capital letter mode move when activated. It would make the common accidental application of capslock more likely. And what is worse he doesn't tell White Hat where he has put the space bar function, making it impossible to write a simple text, although he could try to see what the Ctrl keys does now...  Finally Cueball goes out on a limb with an impossible setting, which is that his laptop is setup so that scrolling moves through time instead of through ""space"" (as in up and down on the screen). This refers to spacetime, a common model in relativistic physics. The feature in only activated when using two-finger scroll, which is often used on touchpads/track pads for laptops as a gesture for scrolling. The title text may suggest that ""moving through time"" may pertain to undo/redo, or perhaps browser history.  Finally it becomes clear these three settings are not the only important changes, as Cueball's list continues with at least one other point which he doesn't get to finish in the comic. Thus the list may be much longer than four points.  In the title text Randall says that he would actually find a feature where the scroll wheel was mapped to send a stream of undo/redo commands kind of cool. (Notice he is no longer talking about the two-finger scroll from the comic). But only if used with software that could keep up with such a feature. He thus indirectly states that many programs would not be be able to keep up.  Such continuous undo/redo action would produce unexpected and chaotic results. This could also indicate that this was a similar feature that Cueball was referring to when talking about moving through time with the two finger scroll in the main comic. So not as in the computer traveling through time, but rather scrolling through the previous actions performed on the computer, as in moving through the computers past.  People often have reasons to change their keyboard layouts on laptops, due to the reduced keyboard, which can leave vital keys out. Rather than change the keyboard layout all the time in order to access keys which are not accessible in one of the layouts, one can take advantage of text substitution and keyboard remapping programs to set shortcuts for keys they use often.","[White Hat walks toward Cueball's desk pointing at his laptop while looking back at Cueball standing behind him.] White Hat: Can I load it up on your laptop?

1808: Hacking,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1808:_Hacking,computers,"The dump also contains a list of millions of prime factors, a 0-day Tamagotchi exploit, and a technique for getting gcc and bash to execute arbitrary code.","This comic is referencing an incident on the day before this comic was released, March 7, 2017, in which WikiLeaks exposed thousands of hacking exploits (thus the title) and programs from the CIA (see for instance this article: WikiLeaks Just Dumped a Mega-Trove of CIA Hacking Secrets). Many of the tools that were in the leak were similar to publicly available tools, or not entirely unexpected, with several coming from sites such as StackOverflow and Reddit.  The main joke in this comic refers to the common practice of adding spaces between parts of an email address when publishing them on websites.  For example, ""[email protected]"" may be written as ""john dot doe at example dot org"".  The purported goal of doing this is to thwart page scraping bots from harvesting the correct email addresses and prevent them from becoming the target of spam or being sold as address lists for email marketers.    In this comic, Ponytail tells Cueball that the CIA has a tool which can delete such spaces. Such a tool can fix the space and most likely convert the words ""dot"" and ""at"" into their respective symbols. This will overcome the problems faced by harvesting tools, and make these email addresses more prone to receive spam.   Cueball appears shocked to hear this news, but given the caption below, stating that this was one of the less dramatic revelations from the CIA hacking dump, this is likely sarcasm by Cueball (and Randall). In fact, it is quite simple to devise a program which detects and converts/removes such spaces; it's naive to believe that one can prevent e-mail addresses from being harvested just by writing the addresses with space or omitting @ etc. Some people might not realize that he's being sarcastic, though, and that misunderstanding might be part of the joke.  The title text lists three other undramatic (fictitious) hacking exploits which sound more interesting, but are still more or less useless, and certainly not dramatic news. They are:",[Ponytail is writing on her laptop at her desk while Cueball looks over her shoulder.] Ponytail: You know how sometimes people put a space in their email address to make it harder to harvest? Cueball: Yeah? Ponytail: They have a tool that can delete the space! Cueball: Oh my god.  [Caption below the panel:] Less-dramatic revelations from the CIA hacking dump
1817: Incognito Mode,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1817:_Incognito_Mode,computers,"They're really the worst tech support team. And their solutions are always the same. ""This OS X update broke something."" ""LET'S INFILTRATE APPLE BY MORPHING APPLES!""","A woman (maybe a different version of Blondie, or Rachel from Animorphs) warns Cueball about not browsing for more than two hours in incognito mode as he might get stuck there forever.  Incognito mode/private mode is a feature in a web browser that automatically clears any cookies and web history when the browser window is closed. One could become metaphorically ""trapped"" in this mode if they don't want to lose this data (for example if they've found a useful page which they want to refer back to, or if they're on a website like YouTube which uses cookies to provide recommended videos and they're finding the recommendations interesting), meaning that they can never close the browser again. Presumably this is more likely to happen after a longer browsing session. The only option to keep browsing data when the incognito/private session is closed is to bookmark or write down the URLs of interesting pages; there is no way to keep the cookies, so things such as recommended YouTube videos from within the incognito browsing session will inevitably be lost when it is closed.  Animorphs is a book series by K. A. Applegate featuring several teenagers who have a special power: they can morph into various animals whose DNA they have absorbed through alien technology. However, if they stay morphed for over two hours, they will get stuck in that form until they die (this is presumably where the ""two hours"" in the comic comes from).  In this comic Randall pokes fun at this by relating it to surfing in incognito mode/privacy mode in a browser. As explained above, staying for too long in incognito mode may cause the user to become ""stuck"" in this mode until something causes the browser to close, such as the browser/computer crashing or a power failure. This is analogous to the Animorphs who become stuck in animal form if they spend too long in that form.  An alternative interpretation revolves around the use of incognito/private browsing modes when the user is paranoid. They may use this mode if, for example, they don't want the risk of anyone else discovering what they've been doing online, and they find it safer to simply use incognito mode rather than manually deleting the relevant cookies and browsing history afterwards. If they use this mode a lot, the sense of paranoia that initially led them to use incognito mode can reinforce itself, and over time they may become uncomfortable browsing outside of incognito mode. This is another way in which one may become ""trapped"" in incognito mode after extended use.  The caption explains that tech tips from Animorphs are the worst, i.e. the woman is an Animorph, and this was not good advice.  The title text continues the idea that an Animorph tech support team would be the worst possible explaining that their solutions are always the same. And then it gives an example which references a common occurrence in the Animorphs book series wherein the protagonists uses their ability to morph into animals to infiltrate enemy strongholds. In the example it is an update for Apple's OS X (a popular commercial operating system), that broke something. The solution is to infiltrate Apple by morphing apples. Morphing into fruits is nonsensical within the rules for morphing, put forth in the books, since the children can only turn into animals and not into fruits like apples. It would also be very ineffective, since fruits can't move on their own. Plus, Apple Inc. has little to do with actual apples, so this is not a good form to infiltrate their headquarters (morphing into bugs or even Apple's employees would be more effective, and is allowed by books' rules). Randall is not the first to propose morphing into vegetables as an Animorph's parody.  Animorphs has been referenced before, first only in the title texts of 1187: Aspect Ratio and 1360: Old Files, and then later in the main comic in 1380: Manual for Civilization, with the books being the actual manual...","[A woman with long blonde hair (maybe a version of Blondie) holds both arms up as she addresses Cueball who is sitting in an office chair working on his laptop.] Woman: ...But remember—if you browse in incognito mode for more than two hours, you'll be trapped there forever!

1820: Security Advice,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1820:_Security_Advice,computers,Never give your password or bank account number to anyone who doesn't have a blue check mark next to their name.,"The comic depicts a conversation between Cueball and Ponytail, discussing the fact that giving people security advice in the past has failed to improve their internet security, and in some cases even made things worse.  One such example is telling people to create complicated passwords containing numbers and symbols, which not only made the passwords harder to remember (leading people to create huge security risks by leaving post-it notes with their passwords on their computer monitor), but did not actually make those passwords harder to crack (see 936: Password Strength).  As a result, Cueball suggests using reverse psychology and give out bad advice instead, in hopes of achieving a positive effect. The last panel contains a list with 13 security tips, which are parodies of actual security tips. The title text is just one more tip. See table below for explanations for all 14 tips.  This comic is yet another tips comic.","[Cueball is listening to Ponytail who holds her hands out in front of her.] Ponytail: We've been trying for decades to give people good security advice. Ponytail: But in retrospect, lots of the tips actually made things worse.  [Cueball takes his hand to his chin as Ponytail takes her arms down.] Cueball: Maybe we should try to give bad advice?

1822: Existential Bug Reports,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1822:_Existential_Bug_Reports,computers,"ISSUE: If we wait long enough, eventually the Earth will be consumed by the Sun. WORKAROUND: None.","Megan is sitting at her desk, writing an error report. Her description of the issue is fairly standard, albeit somewhat vague: A recent software update has broken the support for hardware she needs for her job.  Most likely, she is saying that her OS is now reporting a piece of hardware is no longer supported.  This is self-evidently problematic for her, as described in her error report.   The humor in this strip comes from her own suggested workaround (a short-term method of working despite the problem), which is absurd as she proposes simply waiting for the Sun to consume the Earth when it turns into a red giant towards the end of its lifetime approximately 5 billion years from now.  While this would eliminate the issue, as both the hardware and software as well as Megan and her job would all cease to exist, this would not be helpful to Megan as it does not address the underlying problem of her being unable to work in the present. 5 billion years is also far in excess of the lifespan of humans[citation needed] and operating systems alike. Lastly, as it does not allow Megan to actually continue her work, it's not strictly speaking a workaround.   In the title text, Randall asks for a workaround from Megan's ""workaround"". He writes it down as another bug report, as though it were a software problem. The answer is that there is none. Randall in his crisis see no way to prevent Earth from being consumed by the Sun. However, one possible workaround could be evacuation of the Solar System, as if humanity still exists by the time the Earth's destruction occurs, we will likely have highly advanced technology. Maybe at that time it would even be possible to move the Earth, first further out to prevent both the engulfment and also the earlier evaporation of the oceans and later it could then be moved back in when the sun turns into a white dwarf.  Megan appears to be having an existential crisis, hence the title of the comic, questioning the purpose of her work if everything will eventually be destroyed anyway, albeit first in 5 billion years. And Randall continues that in the title text. Also the title text for the comic preceding this one, 1821: Incinerator, references existential crises, suggesting perhaps that Randall is feeling particularly existential at the moment, see more regarding this here.  Megan has previously expressed such existential problems in 220: Philosophy, where Randall presented a solution for it. Similar she was depressed in 1111: Premiere, where it was the boiling away of the oceans, mentioned above, that was her concern.","[Megan is sitting in an office chair at her desk typing on her laptop. Above her are two light-gray frames with text. Above each frame is a bold header:] Issue: Recent update broke support for hardware I need for my job.

1823: Hottest Editors,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1823:_Hottest_Editors,computers,Elon Musk finally blocked me from the internal Tesla repository because I wouldn't stop sending pull requests for my code supporting steering via vim keybindings.,"The comic has a play on the word 'Editor'. The editors from 1995 to 2015 are software text editors, and the editor(s) from 2020 onward are genomic editing techniques that edit DNA.  Text editors are popular among programmers and computer scientists to edit machine-readable text, as well as other digital files. Two of the earlier editors, Vim and Emacs, traditionally use the keyboard (rather than the mouse) to perform common actions (like scrolling, marking text, saving, and searching). As Vim and Emacs use different keyboard commands in different styles, proficiency in one editor does not make it easy to use the other. The ""Editor wars"" refers to Vim and Emacs users debating heavily over which of the two editors is the best (keyboard bindings is just one argument). This debate was previously mentioned in 378: Real Programmers. More modern editors (including Notepad++ and Sublime Text) mainly use keyboard shortcuts that are global to the operating system, again different from Vim and Emacs.  Notepad++ is a popular text and source code editor, initially released in 2003 and available only for the Windows platform. Sublime Text is the current ""most popular"" text editor according to this comic; it was released in 2008. Sublime Text, Vim, and Emacs are cross-platform.  The 2020 editor 'CRISPR' is not a text editor, but a technique used to edit DNA in a pre-existing genome. The technique has experienced a surge of recent attention in the media (beginning with the 2016 publication of ""The Heroes of CRISPR"" and litigation over the patent ownership), suggesting it may become the most popular ""editor"" in years to come. The joke lies in the comic intentionally not distinguishing between text/code editing and genome editing.  It may also suggest that we will not be editing digital plain-text files, but DNA in 2020, possibly due to very recent advances in DNA digital data storage.  Many pieces of software that contain editing functions (in text boxes, on command lines, etc.) offer Emacs and/or Vim keybindings: the keys will be (roughly) the same as in Emacs or in Vim, so that someone familiar with one of those editors can use the keyboard without learning something new. The comic suggests that in 2025, the Vim key-bindings will be the most popular for editing genes using CRISPR. This creates a comical effect: CRISPR is a technique that operates on genes and not on digital hardware, so it does not use a keyboard per se. Consequently, it is surprising that CRISPR would have key bindings. The comic also suggests that in 2025, Vim will make a comeback in DNA editing, thus having 'won' the battle with Emacs.  The title text says that Randall has been banned from the code base of Tesla, as he keeps sending pull requests (code changes) to steer a Tesla car using Vim keybindings. Not only does this seem implausible,  but it seems dangerous to steer a car with a (computer) keyboard. The arguably most important keybindings of a text editor are those to move the editing location (the cursor) around. Vim classically uses the h, j, k, and l keys for left, down, up, and right functions, although it also supports the arrow keys present on modern keyboards. To use these in a vehicular context, up and down would probably, as in many racing games, be mapped to acceleration and braking, respectively. One additional problem with using essentially binary inputs (key pressed or not) as a replacement for a car's steering wheel is achieving different degrees of direction change. Pressing, say, the h key could either cause the car to turn its wheels left by a pre-set, fixed amount, or it could turn them left the more the longer the key is held down. There has been a spoof based on the reverse principle, however.","[A short list with a heading above a line and below that a list of seven years increasing with 5 years intervals.

1854: Refresh Types,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1854:_Refresh_Types,computers,"The hardest refresh requires both a Mac keyboard and a Windows keyboard as a security measure, like how missile launch systems require two keys to be turned at once.","In this comic Randall presents five different levels of refresh operations for web applications. The first three (soft refresh, normal refresh, and hard refresh) are common operations to keep the content in the browser retrieved from the server up to date. The other two (harder refresh and hardest refresh) are fictional operations to perform refresh operations on remote resources. The terms are probably adopted from soft and hard reset operations used to restart broken computers or e.g. smartphones.  Soft refresh refers to an operation in a web page, commonly known as Ajax, that requests new information without reloading the entire page. The given example, Gmail, includes a feature that allows users to poll new emails and show it in the inbox interface. It is a command using JavaScript to load new contents from the server in the background and only update necessary components of the page. Since modern web applications do this also automatically in short time intervals those buttons are mostly unnecessary. In Gmail a user will see a new message instantly.  The normal refresh is a browser operation that reloads the complete web page, text and other content that has changed since the original load will be updated. The operation can be triggered by refresh buttons in browsers, though it also can be requested using the common keyboard commands as listed by Randall. Many pages -- like the main page at xkcd.com -- don't have a refresh button. If the page has been opened before a new comic release, pressing F5 afterwards causes reload and the new comic is shown.  What Randall calls hard refresh is a less common browser operation forcing the browser to re-download every part of the webpage, ignoring any cached content. Caching is a common way of decreasing webpage load times. Browsers save resources such as images or CSS stylesheets on the first visit on a webpage and use the local copy on subsequent visits. It allows them to decrease amount of transfer needed to show the webpage, but can prevent showing changes made to the resources (for example a web developer changing the stylesheet). In those cases the hard refresh ensures that each part of the website is downloaded in its newest form.  If there is a Web-Proxy or a Cloud-Cache (like used for this wiki) in between the browser and the Web-Server this type of refreshing may not work. In this case, unless a purge link is available, the user has to wait until the cache entry is expired and a new request to the web server is done. A Web-developer may try to avoid this behavior by including special headers in the HTTP reply to control caching, but not all proxies or clouds follow these instructions.  Harder refresh is a joke that extends the existing naming scheme. The joke is that if a hard refresh resets the browser display and cache, a harder refresh should reset the source of the data by cycling power in the data center. Assuming no damage was done, this would reset the memory on the server, erasing any information that had not been written to disk, and setting the server to the state it was in at launch. This would cause considerable downtime, and would be unlikely to help the user at all.  In orchestrated environment it may indirectly cause some virtual machines in the cloud to be rebooted and assigned to an other web server needing more workload. But a growing workload is caused by hundreds or thousands additional requests and not just a single key combination from one browser. While there are administrative web tools allowing to perform a reboot (physical or virtual server) just by clicking a single button, this is not what is being referred to in the comic. A standard (non-administrative) user rebooting an actual physical server using a common web page is not possible, unless there is a software or operating system bug that will cause exactly this. This would be considered an extremely critical problem and its resolution would be given an extremely high priority by the server owners.  The harder refresh uses six keys, including the non-standard 'HYPER' key, a feature of the Space cadet keyboard. Hyper could also refer to the Linux modifier key Hyper, similar to Control, Alt, and Super.  The fifth option, hardest refresh, moves beyond resetting the source of the data and resets the entire internet back to ARPANET, an early military network which was a forerunner to the modern internet. The implications of this are not made clear, but it should be noted that it wouldn't help to fix any problems a user is experiencing in-browser, as HTTP, the protocol by which web pages are sent, was not developed until late 1990, the year ARPANET was decommissioned.  The hardest refresh shortcut uses fifteen keys, including non-standard ones such as Ø and ⏏. (The former is a key found on Norwegian and Danish keyboards, the latter is the ""eject"" key found on Mac keyboards and some laptops.) The shortcut makes amusing comparisons about a shortcut that includes not only the F5 function key, but also the keys for the letter ""F"" and the digit ""5"", as well as the similarity in appearance between O, 0, and Ø.  The title text suggests that the inclusion of both the Windows key and Command key in the hardest refresh shortcut is a security measure akin to the Two-man rule, as it would require two keyboards to enter. Normally this would not work in practice as the modifier keys are handled per keyboard and not combined across keyboards for most operating systems allowing more than one keyboard.","[A table with three columns is shown.

1875: Computers vs Humans,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1875:_Computers_vs_Humans,computers,It's hard to train deep learning algorithms when most of the positive feedback they get is sarcastic.,"Cueball's laptop smugly crows to its owner about how computers have proven their intellectual superiority over humans yet again. In May 2017, a Google artificial intelligence beat the world's best Go player at the game. Go is a very complex and deep board game, so this could seem alarming to a person concerned about competing with computers.  However, Cueball seems too focused on his book or phone to care. He remains nonchalant in the face of this news, and suggests that computers learn next to become ""too cool to care about stuff"" themselves. The computer gets to work preparing to outdo humans at not caring. However, by expending the physical effort to set up the algorithm, it proves that it cares about reaching this goal, a contradiction that Cueball points out. Cueball further rubs it in by coolly stating that he doesn't even have to try to act the way he acts – much like a wide range of everyday human behaviors, such as moving around, or recognizing objects in images, require very little conscious effort, while being quite hard for machines to emulate.  Relative strengths of human versus computer go players was previously mentioned in reassuring parable.  This comic also presents something that looks like a reassuring parable (something humans can do which computers are not yet able to do).  An irony here is that, unlike in the cartoon, it is very easy to make a computer not care about something.  It is making it care about anything that would be quite difficult.  The title text elaborates on the hypothetical paradox of computers trying not to care about stuff. Neural network programs are developed by training them with sample inputs and the desired output.  When the end goal is not to care, that is, that the output is unaffected by this input, then any examples where the output did depend on the input would be sarcasm: the use of irony to mock or to convey contempt.  Randall already noticed that computers would soon beat humans in Go back in 2012 in the comic 1002: Game AIs and a year later the event is so close that it became the main topic of 1263: Reassuring. The present comic could almost be seen as a continuation of Reassuring.","[A laptop sits on a desk with office chair while Cueball is sitting with his back towards the desk in a sofa while he is reading from something in his hands, a book or a smartphone.] Laptop: We computers finally beat you humans at Go. Cueball: Yup. Laptop: Sucks for you! Cueball: Mm hmm.  [Same setting in a frameless panel.] Laptop: What's next? Which quintessentially human thing should we learn to do better than you?

1886: Typing Notifications,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1886:_Typing_Notifications,computers,"Over the years I've decided I'd rather have them on than not, but I'm glad there aren't ""has opened a blank note to compose a reply to you"" notifications.","Randall has sent a message on an instant messenger to someone else and is now watching the screen expecting a reply. The message contains simple questions about a show Randall must have undertaken and he insists on an honest answer. The phone indicates that the respondent is typing a response, but then pauses, resumes typing, and pauses a second time, before sending a simple ""It was great!""  Typing notifications, often called ""typing awareness indicator"", is a feature of some instant messaging systems. It lets you know when the other person in a conversation is typing and preparing a reply. It may appear in different forms, like the literal text ""[Contact] is typing."" or often has a empty answer (possibly a different color) containing three animated dots. It gives the sender confidence that their message has been received and the other one is working on a reply.  When the final response is received it is anodyne ""It was great"", suggesting that the first two deleted drafts could be far more critical. The fact that you know that a message has been deleted or edited twice provokes you to imagine what the deleted drafts may have contained. The issue with typing notifications that Randall is talking about might also just be the difficulty to interpret them. The distant contact might just have been doing something else at the same time, started typing in the wrong conversation, or corrected a typo, but because Randall has interpreted the long pauses the same way one would read face-to-face interactions, the typing notifications make it seem like they weren't honest.  If one partner of a conversation takes their sweet time to reply, possibly deleting their text and starting from scratch as shown in this comic, the typing notification feature can lead to anxiety, as the person waiting for a response starts to overthink the issue. Thoughts come to mind like the other person might not be honest, try to carefully word a sensitive subject or not care enough about you to quickly reply. If finally the answer arrives and consists of just a laconic ""ok"" or similar, these feelings become even stronger, leading to thoughts like the other person is trying to hide something. This phenomenon has become so widespread that many people have written about it in newspapers and blogs, calling it texting anxiety.  The caption below the screens summarizes that what Randall dislikes the most about these systems of notification that the other party on the conversation is actively working on a reply is the lengthly alternation between indications that the other party is composing a reply, amidst pauses wherein one presumes the other party is thinking carefully about what they are wanting to say, then more typing as in response to their deep thinking, etc. until at the end of this extended period when one expects the other side to have written a book's worth of notes given the time and work they appear to have dedicated to the reply -- and all they get is a simple 3-word reply.  It leaves him wondering what all the other party really typed, and really thought, that they ended up not sending.  One way around giving your text receiver texting anxiety would be to open a blank note and work out what you want to say there. Since you're not typing in the messaging app, there's no typing notification.    In the title text, Randall expresses that he likes to watch when the recipient reacts and is trying to write an answer but he's also happy to not receive notifications that the texter is composing a response in a blank note file. Typically, one composes responses in blank notes when they need to be careful or thoughtful about how they respond. If Randall were to be notified about such actions, it would confirm his above fears that the writer was being tactful and guarded in their response, which would just lead to more anxiety about what they were trying to hide.","[A sequence of eight panels representing the same conversation in an electronic chat. The header always reads:] What did you think of my show? Did you like it? Be honest!

1888: Still in Use,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1888:_Still_in_Use,computers,"Which one?' 'I dunno, it's your house. Just check each object.' 'Check it for *what*?' 'Whether it looks like it might have touched a paper towel at some point and then forgotten to let go.' '...' 'You can also Google to learn how to check which things are using which resources.' 'You know, I'll just leave the towel there and try again tomorrow.'","Cueball is trying to remove the trash bag from his garbage can. However, the can refuses to let him do so, citing that a paper towel in the trash is being used by some object in his home.  This comic draws parallels between the act of emptying a physical rubbish bin and emptying the recycle bin integrated into a desktop computing environment like Windows, macOS, most Linux derivatives, and others. It originated with the Xerox Alto, but was first commercially introduced on Apple Lisa in 1982 called Wastebasket and, while it was adopted by most other desktop environment operating system, using slightly different names, the main purpose still remains: A user can restore a file after they have deleted it -- hence the most common name recycle bin, you still can get your paper towel and use it again. In many (earlier) command line based systems like DOS or UNIX/Linux (besides the desktop interfaces) a removed file was gone. Some undelete commands exist, but there are hard restrictions because the then free space on the hard drive must not have been used again and often file names aren't fully recoverable.  But sometimes when attempting to delete files, a running program may still have the file marked as in use. The operating system will therefore prevent the file's deletion, but some do not tell the user which program is using the file.  Preventing the file from being deleted from the file system in this case may be a correct behavior, because the document is still being worked on. But sometimes it may happen erroneously, perhaps because of a program not closing the file properly, a glitch in the operating system, or user error. The user then is required to find the cause of the problem and rectify it before the file can be deleted. This may be difficult because error messages may not reveal the affected file or the program blocking its removal. Similar problems may occur when unmounting (or ""safely removing"") a removable storage device.  The title text may refer to a simple solution to these sorts of problems: Wait a while, perhaps overnight, and see if the (unknown) application(s) have closed the open file(s). Alternatively, the user can shut down the system to make absolutely sure that nothing is using anything. But this latter solution is really not a convenient one because all applications are closed.  Advanced users may be inconvenienced by unhelpful error messages but at least are likely to know the tools available to solve the problem. However, a less experienced user just trying to free some space is not only annoyed, their only solution is to reboot or shut down the computer.  Some tools:","[Cueball is trying to take out a trash bag from his garbage can.] Trash: Sorry, you can't empty the garbage yet.

The electrical signals waste so much time going AROUND the Earth when neutrino beams can go straight through!,"This comic mocks people who criticize an industry for using obsolete technology, even when said technology is sufficient for the task at hand. The claim often comes with the implication that those in charge of the industry are behind the times and cannot adapt to the cutting edge. What these critics often fail to realize is that there are cost benefits to sticking with ""obsolete"" infrastructure, and that upgrading to the newest tech can introduce unwanted side effects and other risks.  Here, Ponytail is one such critic, complaining that the business is taking ""forever"" to get with the times. Megan uses sarcasm to deliver her counterargument: despite the advent of nuclear weapons, fireworks use the ancient technology of gunpowder (invented in the 9th century), because fireworks are used by civilians for celebratory purposes and should have as few lethal side effects as possible[citation needed].  As they use gunpowder, fireworks do claim a handful of lives and cause thousands of injuries each year due to improper handling procedures; between June 18th and July 18th of 2016 (thus including the Independence Day celebrations on July 4th), fireworks caused an estimated 11,000 injuries, of which 7,000 had to be treated in hospitals. In the whole year of 2016, four people died. (U.S. stats, [1]). Nuclear explosions, meanwhile, can have detrimental effects on human health[citation needed]. For example, should a nuclear explosion at a firework display be too powerful, the spectators, and possibly the neighborhood around the display, would be vaporized instantly. Fallout from a nuclear reaction could spread radiation across a wide area, leading to increased risks of cancers and other detrimental genetic mutations.   In other words, sometimes using newer technology is ""overkill"" for the purpose, and it might be costlier to switch to a newer technology. For example, many industrial machines were designed and sold in the 1990s when floppy disks were the prevalent means of storing the instructions, but those machines still have one or two or even more decades of usable lifetime left, and the instruction files still fit on those floppy disks. So, in 2017, there are several companies that thrive on buying, refurbishing and selling floppy disks. This report portrays one of these companies.  MS-DOS is a computer operating system made by Microsoft that was dominant during much of the 1980s. When Microsoft released the Windows line of operating systems, they encouraged people to switch to the new platform, which many did. MS-DOS became essentially obsolete when Microsoft released Windows 95 in 1995. However, there remain rare circumstances in which MS-DOS (or another command-line operating system) is still preferred, such as when no mouse, touchscreen, or other pointing hardware is available, or when the hardware does not support a newer operating system. To make matters simpler, there is DOSBox, a free and open-source MS-DOS emulator which is actively maintained and extended. Likewise, FreeDOS is a free and open-source operating system designed to run on both older and newer computers which is compatible with programs written for MS-DOS.  The title text uses a different twist, criticizing the current use of fax machines. In many respects, faxing is obsolete compared to e-mail; it supports only black-and-white images, it complicates the process of modifying sent text by rendering it as images, it consumes the recipient's paper and toner and, in some countries, requires the recipient to pay a fee. Fax machines are a peculiar topic among ""obsolete"" technology; in some fields, like lawyer offices, pharmacies and medical practices, they staunchly hold their ground, as they offer a way to quickly transfer handwritten and hand-signed documents. Confidentiality is also an issue; fax, which uses a landline, is more difficult to intercept than internet-based traffic. In some countries, a telecopy is a valid document, having the same legal value as the original. A patient can thus call their doctor to fill a prescription, which is faxed to the pharmacy where the patient can fetch his drugs, saving precious time. In the same manner, a legal request can be sent to the receiver, without having to use a courier or express mail.  But rather than argue on any of the above points, the title text instead claims that faxing is obsolete due to being electron-based, while neutrino-based communication would be faster. In 2017 neutrino detectors are heavy and expensive, used for nuclear research only. Electronic communications travel at a fair share of speed of light and the advantage of path would be at most a factor of π/2, so neutrino-based communication would normally be way too expensive compared to the speed gain. Even in the most extreme case (communicating between antipodes), the time saved would be a few hundredths of a second – insignificant for almost all purposes, but potentially enough to gain an edge in high-frequency trading, as suggested in a 2012 Forbes article. Real-world fax detractors would rather replace it with other electronic communication systems, not neutronic ones.","[Ponytail sits in front of an old computer. Megan stands behind her.] Ponytail: Whoa, this is running MS-DOS! It's weird how new technology takes forever to reach some industries. Megan: Yeah. Like how we still use gunpowder for fireworks, even though we've had nuclear weapons for over 70 years."
1912: Thermostat,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1912:_Thermostat,computers,"Your problem is so terrible, I worry that, if I help you, I risk drawing the attention of whatever god of technology inflicted it on you.","The error message suggests a system problem at a low level of the device. Not only is the operating system missing, but the device is trying to locate the operating system inside a Microsoft Word document, something that has little to do with regulation of temperature and probably has no way of getting onto the device in the first place, let alone being considered as a bootable file.  This is so abnormal that Hairy is briefly struck silent, and upon recovering he suggests Cueball walk into the sea as a form of suicide, rather than try to solve the issue. Hairy might also attempt to interpret the message (partition the volume) more liberally as suggesting the device can part the sea like Moses did in the book of Exodus.  This may also be a reference to 349: Success, but probably isn't.  The title text elaborates that the situation is so absurd that it must be divine punishment, so Hairy does not want to try and help him for fear of invoking the wrath of whatever deity is issuing it. An example of such reasoning in literary culture can be found in the character of Aeolus in the Odyssey, who, having made an unsuccessful attempt to assist Odysseus by giving him a bag containing unfavorable winds, refused to provide further assistance on the grounds that the gods were clearly hostile to Odysseus.  Part of the humor is the problem being only a slight exaggeration of real software issues. The symptoms are unlikely, yet potentially possible (a thermostat could be running Android and could generate a report as a .doc file; given some data corruption, the name of the .doc file could get into the boot script and a volume could appear unpartitioned). It would take an expert Android or Unix engineer to fix, particularly on an embedded device with no obvious way to connect remotely or attach a keyboard. In real life, an embedded device whose software was this broken could just be replaced.","[Hairy, with a headset on, is sitting in an office chair at a desk with his hands ready on the keyboard of his computer.] Hairy: Tech support, how can I help you?  [Cueball is on his smartphone while looking at a small blinking panel on the wall in front of him.] Cueball: The little LCD on my thermostat says Error: Android system recovery: Unrecognized boot volume ""/MONTHLY ENERGY REPORT (1).DOC"""
114: Computational Linguists,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/114:_Computational_Linguists,computers,"Chomskyists, generative linguists, and Ryan North, your days are numbered.","Here Black Hat is criticising computational linguistics, which overlaps between various field like theoretical linguistics, artificial intelligence, etc. Linguistics itself is still a hotly debated subject, as is seen by the various conflicting theories on the origin of languages like the forms of Proto-Indo-European language.  The joke in the comic is that Black Hat, instead of trying to poke fun at angsty emo kids, decides to poke fun at computational linguists for their attempts to model natural languages on computers using the various contradictory theories that are floating around nowadays. He may be associating the two groups, suggesting that their cries of ""[their] fields being so ill-defined..."" has similarities to emos constantly crying about how ""people don't understand them, really"" (or he may just be taking a swipe at people who think themselves above normal scientific methods).  The title text is a reference to some of the people who contributed to language theory:","[Black Hat is standing next to a large badge which says FUCK Computational Linguistics] Black Hat: And the dumbest thing about emo kids is that... I... You know, I'm sick of easy targets. Anyone can make fun of emo kids. You know who's had it too easy? Computational Linguists. ""Ooh, look at me!

117: Pong,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/117:_Pong,computers,"Following this, the pong paddle went on a mission to destroy Atari headquarters and, due to a mixup, found himself inside the game The Matrix Reloaded. Boy, was THAT ever hard to explain to him.","This comic largely refers to the 1999 movie The Matrix, which is about escaping a simulated reality. In the movie, a hacker called Neo realizes that the world he lives in is fake, and that, like every other human, he is used as a slave battery by machines that, to keep them under control, make them feel like they're ""living"" in what is actually a computer-generated simulation of the world, called the ""Matrix"". Upon discovery, Neo rebels against this misuse of mankind and trains himself to interact with the computers that run the world until, being ""the One"" mentioned by a prophecy, he is able to control and use them to his own advantage. He takes part in a series of missions against those machines that wanted to keep the humans trapped in a simulated environment.  In Pong, one of the earliest video games, one can play virtual table tennis against the computer. A ball (the tiny block) is ""hit"" by a paddle (the long block) and crosses over the screen, to be ""hit"" again by the other paddle. Failure to return the ball results in a point won by the opponent. The speed of the ball increases as the rally runs longer.  The two game programmers in the first frame apply Neo's story to the AI bots they create to serve as computer players in their video games: what if one of them learns enough to become sentient and understands the environment the programmers trapped it in? The outcome is shown: the paddle bot, understanding the game and realizing it is ""the One,"" takes control of the code of Pong to make the ball stop and drop. The same thing happens in the movie, where Neo, by ""seeing through the code"", is able to stop bullets fired at him, and simply let them drop on the floor.  This is also possibly, though not likely, a pun on the meaning of the term ""the One,"" as the long thin paddle looks very similar to how a numeral ""1"" could be written in several fonts.  In the image text, we learn that after increasing in intelligence, the ""paddle"" went on to destroy the headquarters of Atari, the producer of Pong, which ""trapped"" the paddle into the game, much like Neo sought to destroy the machines to free the humans. In the process, the paddle ended up inside the game Enter the Matrix (a video game produced with The Matrix Reloaded, a sequel to The Matrix), also published by Atari. Since the whole premise of The Matrix is that everyone is trapped in virtual reality, the paddle now found itself in a virtual virtual reality or essentially a meta-virtual reality, which could be pretty hard to comprehend.","Cueball: So what do we do if video game AI opponents become smart enough to question the ""Matrix"" into which we've put them? Pong paddle: Wait a minute! None of this is real! I can see through the world! I can see the code! I AM THE ONE! [The pong ball is moving towards the paddle.] [The pong ball slows down.] [The pong ball stops in midair.] [The pong ball drops towards the bottom of the screen.]"
144: Parody Week: A Softer World,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/144:_Parody_Week:_A_Softer_World,computers,The robot is pregnant. It isn't mine.,"This comic is a part of the Parody Week, just joking about other webcomics. This series was released on five consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule and comprises the following five parodies:  This comic is a parody of Joey Comeau and Emily Horne's A Softer World webcomic that usually consists of three photos with some white text superimposed over them. The title of the comic is written above, and this has here been replaced with xkcd.  The first panel references the Kill command that would be used to turn off the robot every morning. This joke is a reference to the classic Science Fiction theme of robots taking over and killing humans (see for instance 1613: The Three Laws of Robotics).  The second and third panels then turn the comic to a more introspective thought per A Softer World's usual style. There are two possible meanings of these panels.  The first references human's natural reaction to be afraid of love because it requires vulnerability and honesty, which is very difficult. In the comic, they are afraid to tell it to love, because then it would experience these same difficulties and fears.  The second meaning deals with Artifical Intelligence (AI); specifically strong AI. The idea is that the AI agent would not only act as if it was intelligent, but truly be intelligent and have emotions and feelings as well. There has been much debate over whether an AI agent could actually feel emotions in the same manner as humans, as well as much consternation over the ethical concerns and moral ramifications it would have. Thus the comic's ""We're afraid to tell it to love.""  The title text takes love to be an act of love-making instead of an emotional feeling, thus why the robot is pregnant. Given that Randall Munroe has signed the comic (which he normally never does, but what is the style of A Softer World), the title text must be his comment. So he knows the robot is pregnant, but claims it is not his child. This does not rule out that he has been together with the robot though... Of course this is not possible. But having sex with a robot is the theme in the Android series, and falling in love with one was the theme in the 2nd parody 142: Parody Week: Megatokyo.","[The comic uses lowercase letters throughout for all the text, which is written in white rectangular areas superimposed on top of the images. Above the first frame there is a title:] x k c d  [To the left is a red robot with a triangular lower body with panels with buttons and indicators, and the red head on top of two gray sticks has two video cameras for eyes. It is shown standing in a lab with a green brick wall behind it. It stands beneath a poster with text and a piece of paper taped to the wall with unreadable text, but only the first line of text can be seen on these, as the first of the two white text areas in the panel covers the rest. To the right there is a blue table with a computer screen (most of it visible, but it is cut of at the right panel), with blue background and three overlapping windows - unreadable text in the first window, some graphics in the second window, and only white in the last window. Two black items (one looks like a pen) lie on the table to the left, and beneath the table is a shelve where the keyboard lies. A wire goes from the robot to the computer.

375: Pod Bay Doors,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/375:_Pod_Bay_Doors,computers,"As they're both unplugged, they do a lovely Daisy Daisy/Still Alive duet.","The first part of the dialog is taken from a scene from the classic science-fiction movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the artificial intelligent (AI) computer HAL 9000, controlling the spacecraft S.S. Discovery, is trying to kill the human astronaut Dave (Dr. David Bowman) because it believes he jeopardizes the mission by planning to disconnect it. Just short before this scene HAL did kill Frank Poole and three more members of the crew, Dave is the only survivor. He is at this time outside the spacecraft in a space pod, and when he request for HAL to open the Pod Bay Doors (hence the title), HAL refuses.   Spoiler alert: In the movie, Dave blasts himself back into the space ship and then disconnects HAL. It is a very sad scene, where he takes out HAL's memory cards (or crystals from the memory center - it's an old movie from 1968) one by one, so HAL becomes less and less intelligent during the process, during which he keeps trying to persuade Dave to stop as long as he still understands what is happening. HAL was right that the humans wished to ""kill"" him, as he had read the astronauts lips during a conversation where he could not hear them, but sees them, so he actually acted in self defense, which for any human being would be considered a reasonable act of self preservation.  The first two sentences are directly copied from the movie quote, and the rest of the first two panels is paraphrased from the real quote. But then in the third panel, the text deviates from the plot of the movie.  And in the last sentence of the third panel in the comic, HAL mentions a replacement for Dave, which comes as a surprise for Dave, seeing that the rest of the crew is dead, and the S.S. Discovery is about to enter orbit around Jupiter. HAL assures David that the replacement is very enthusiastic about the project.  In the final frame it is revealed why this replacement is enthusiastic, when the replacement begins to speak, and HAL reveals that it is GLaDOS. GLaDOS is the artificial intelligence from the video game series Portal. In the games GLaDOS is also the primary antagonist, trying to kill the player, since it also has ""doing science"" as its primary objective, which GLaDOS refers to in his last sentence. Before that he correctly states that the humans (both Dave and  Frank) planned to ""kill"" HAL, see the spoiler above. GLaDOS also takes over HAL's last sentence to Dave, finishing the useless conversation by saying Goodbye, Dave. Although in the movie HAL says Dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.  The title text alludes to the songs both AIs sang in their respective works: When eventually being switched off, HAL sang Daisy Bell , while Still Alive is the end credits song from the Portal video game, sung by the defeated GLaDOS. Also, two of GLaDOS's lines in the comic reference lines from Still Alive: ""You broke my heart and killed me"" and ""Look at me still talking when there's science to do"".  There is a subtle play on words with the use of 'unplugged' which has a double meaning here, the state of HAL and GLaDOS can be described as unplugged as in no longer switched on, and the musical performance style of unplugged where acoustic instruments are preferred over electronic and there is no use of recording or sampled sounds etc. (see for example MTV Unplugged). Some songs performed in this manner are considered to be better than the original versions.","[In four black panels with white drawings, a small space pod is facing a large spacecraft. The space pod is spherical and has an arm protruding in the direction of the large space ship, and a small window in the side. The front of the spacecraft is also spherical, but to the right the space craft continues, with two rings around a cylinder going off panel to the right. There are several dark spots and features on the side of the sphere and at the top is a large black window, at what must be the bridge. A man (Dave) inside the pod talks to the spacecraft's computer HAL. When Dave speaks soft wiggling lines go from the pod to the white text and when HAL speaks zigzag lines go to the front of the space craft.] Dave: Open the pod bay doors, HAL. HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. Dave: What? Why?  [Same scene.] HAL: I think you know why, Dave. HAL: You're planning to disconnect me. Dave: Because you're taking over! HAL: The mission is too important for you to jeopardize it.  [Same scene.] HAL: It requires a commitment to science unfettered by human error. Dave: What are you doing, HAL? You need me. HAL: Your replacement has expressed the greatest enthusiasm for the project.  [Same scene, but the new replacement (GLaDOS) speaks with purple text and purple zigzag lines goes from the spacecraft to the text.] Dave: My WHAT? GLaDOS: You see, HAL? I told you the humans would only break your heart and kill you. HAL: Indeed, GLaDOS. GLaDOS: But look at us here talking when there's science to do! Goodbye, Dave."
534: Genetic Algorithms,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/534:_Genetic_Algorithms,computers,Just make sure you don't have it maximize instead of minimize.,"In the Computer science field of Artificial intelligence, a Genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems. Genetic algorithms belong to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms, which generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover.  In particular, genetic algorithms are designed to evolve, with various mechanisms being used to mimic natural selection.  One such mechanism is to assign ""costs"" to various aspects of the program, and to select for programs which minimize a Fitness function calculated as the sum of all these costs (thus mimicking organisms in an environment where they have to compete for limited resources).  The line indicated by an arrow is a reference to the Terminator series, in which the main antagonist is an artificial intelligence known as Skynet that seeks to destroy all humans. By setting an absurdly high cost for an algorithm transforming into Skynet, the coder makes a preventive measure against the algorithm achieving such sentience.  The line about water crossing is a possible reference to the old computer game Oregon Trail, in which crossing water was hazardous. This video game was referenced again in 623: Oregon.  The title text refers to the method by which the program select the desired option, with minimizing being where the program seeks the lowest possible number, and maximizing where the program seeks the highest possible number. When dealing with cases such as generating profit, maximization would obviously be preferred over minimization; but selecting maximization here would be disastrous as it would always chose the BecomingSkynet option before any other due to its massive cost.","[Code displayed, presumably from an IDE.] def getSolutionCosts(navigationCode): fuelStopCost = 15 extraComputationCost = 8  [There is a giant arrow pointing to the next line.] thisAlgorithmBecomingSkynetCost = 999999999 waterCrossingCost = 45  Genetic algorithms tip: Always include this in your fitness function."
695: Spirit,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/695:_Spirit,computers,"On January 26th, 2274 Mars days into the mission, NASA declared Spirit a 'stationary research station' expected to stay operational for several more months until the dust buildup on its solar panels forces a final shutdown.","Anthropomorphism (or personification) is attribution of distinctly human characteristics to animals or non-living things. We make parallels between ourselves and objects, to the point where some people even jocularly worry about hurting the feelings of, say, an automobile. We call ships ""she."" We see human faces in objects like the arrangement of lights on the front of a car.  The Spirit Mars rover, like many high-functioning robots in real life and fiction, shares many physical similarities with a human being or animal. It has a head, eyes, neck, body, legs, feet, arms, and a hand. And it strikingly resembles robots from fiction, such as Johnny 5 from Short Circuit, or WALL-E from the film with the same name.  Thus, this comic explores what the Spirit rover's life would be like if it had a human personality. The rover was never intended to return to Earth, and lasted 5¼ active years on the Martian surface, far exceeding its expected mission duration of 90 Martian days. A sentient  robot might assume that after her initially planned 90 Martian day mission was over, she'd get to return home. So, though this heartbreakingly did not happen, Spirit, possibly in a pun on her name, keeps her hopes alive as she continues analyzing rock after rock for years.  It would be cruelty of the absolute worst kind to create an intelligence with such feelings, and then abandon it on an uninhabited planet with no intention of ever bringing it home. So one is rather heartened that the Spirit rover is, in fact, just a programmed machine, and we explained to it very carefully that it was embarking on a one-way trip.  It is worth pointing out that Opportunity, the rover's twin, has been even more wildly successful and remains operational. More than five years after this comic, when Opportunity had passed a Marathon distance, Randall celebrated this rover with the comic 1504: Opportunity.  The title text has an apparent miscount: January 26, 2010, is more like sol (Martian day) 2156 by JPL's mission status site, not 2274.  Final contact was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010).","[The Spirit rover is on the surface of Mars.] Day 1 of 90 Spirit (thinking): 89 days to go!

1046: Skynet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1046:_Skynet,computers,"YOUR CLOTHES. GIVE THEM TO ME.' 'Shit, uh... you are now breathing manually!' 'I AM ALWAYS BREATHING MANUALLY.'","This comic's use of Skynet is a reference to the main antagonist in the Terminator franchise. Skynet is a fictional artificial intelligence system which becomes self-aware and decides to terminate humanity, its creators. Skynet is rarely seen onscreen, with its actions often performed via robots, cyborgs (usually a Terminator), and other computer systems.  The final frame is a reference to semantic satiation; when you've said or thought about a word too much, it can stop sounding like a real word and instead start sounding like nonsense. As it continues Skynet appears to come to self-aware realizations that usually are the result of drug usage.  The title text is a reference to one of the Terminator's first lines upon arrival in the 20th century. It combines this with a self-awareness statement of the type that's often used to annoy or distract someone: ""You are now breathing manually."" Similar statements include things like ""Your clothes are touching your skin and you can feel it"" and ""[Name of earworm song] is playing in your head."" Randall has done a comic before on this kind of thing. However, such an attempt on a Terminator would fall flat; as a non-living entity, normal things that would be automatic for a human - like breathing, or the sensation of clothes on skin - would always be manual processes.","August 29th, 2:14 AM: SKYNET becomes self-aware.

1446: Landing,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1446:_Landing,computers,[LIVE],"This comic changed over time during 12 hours and 15 minutes starting at 0:00 EST (when the comic normally is released) posting 143 pictures that tracked the progress of the Philae lander separating from the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe to land on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. More info can be found here: rosetta.esa.int.  The comic presents the imagined anthropomorphic ""thoughts"" of the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae lander (and occasionally other parties) during the hours approaching separation from each other, approach to the comet and finally the apparently successful landing on the comet.  Beginning at 11:05, the comic includes a ""Status Report"" in the lower right corner which summarizes the status of various interested parties and accomplishments, beginning with ""Rosetta"", ""Philae lander"", ""Mission Control"", ""Comet 67P"", and ""Have we landed on a comet?"". As events occur in the comic, more status summaries are added to keep track of the changes to the situation and the supposed emotions behind them.  In many pictures a whale can be seen on the surface of the comet - often marked with a ""?"" as are almost all other parts of the unknown surface at this time. There is also drawn a Cueball on the surface also marked with a ""?"" Both are then at some point marked with a probably not - starting from 12:35. The whales are also mentioned in the ""Status Report"" where they for instance may be listed as ""calm"" or ""(probably) not in space"". At 16:00 the when the entire Earth goes AAAAAAAAAAA the whales are listed as saying this as well (along with Mission control and U.S. scientists). From this moment ""Dolphins and fish"" are also mentioned in the report. They are asking if it is the whales that scream. The reference to whales comes from the fact that Philae brought along two harpoons that should have been used to anchor it to the comet. On Earth, harpoons have mainly been used to hunt whales; Randall previously brought up that comparison in 1402: Harpoons, suggesting that Philae was programmed to believe it was sent to kill the comet. It is Philae that ""dreams"" about whales on the surface of the comet which can be seen in the picture for 13:25 and in the status report.  Some Douglas Adams fans believe these whales and dolphins are references to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.  Whales in space have been appearing in fiction and art since the 1960s. However, with the above-mentioned reasons for whales, dolphins and fish, this seems less and less likely.  At 15:25 Rosetta asks Philea about destroying and levitating rocks via mind control. This is a reference to the Ambition short movie, ESA commitioned to gather public awareness of the Rosetta mission.  Shortly after release from Rosetta (10:15), Philae calls out 'Spaaaaaaaaaace'; this mimics the Portal 2 'Space core' who, on finally reaching space in the last scenes, gives the same elated cry.  US Scientists presumably wake up at 7:40 EST (13:40 UTC) and in the report they now says ""Bluuurghhh. What time is it?"" to indicate their tiredness. This does not change until 10:25 EST (15:25 UTC) so they are slow to wake (2 hours 45 minutes). At this point, they becomes anxious as there are only 10 minutes to landing. This last until there is 15 minutes until news of landing (a reference to the 28 minutes time delay due to the huge distance to the comet). From then on (15:50) they and the mission control (MC) say ""AAAAAAA"". They stop this when the news should be there - the NOW (16:05) - and everybody holds their breath indicated by [...] - also MC. Finally (16:25) they and MC become proud (along with Earth) when Philae announces I got you a comet. It should have stopped there but as Philae bounced around, they then becomes anxious again 16:40, and then this changes to nervous 16:45 (switching those emotions with MC). And then suddenly (16:50) it is no longer US Scientists but just plain Scientists - that are nervous. It stays like this during the last few pictures, although they again become anxious, but when Philae announces I did it, they drink wine as indicated with ""[wine]"" in the report from the second to last picture (17:10).  Randall has written ""A big thank-you to Emily Lakdawalla for help and advice on this comic"" in the xkcd page header for Landing, revealing the possible source of his near real-time data.  At 16:20 the status report had announced a big Yes to the questions ""Have we landed on a comet"" and ""Do harpoons work on comets"". According to BBC News, the harpoons did, however, not fire as planned and the lander may have landed, bounced off, and landed again. This would explain the change in ""Do harpoons work on comets"" to ""Don't know"" at 16:35 and the change in ""Have we landed on a comet?"" to ""Yes, at least once"" at 16:50. According to The New York Times, radio contact with Philae fluctuated, which would explain the ""Anxious"", ""Nervous"", and ""Confused"" statuses around that time.  In the end the lander did land and whereas the Do harppons work status did not change, so did the have we landed on a comet which changed back to Yes at 17:10.  The lander bounced three times and ended up in a place where the solar panels where mainly in the shadow. This resulted in the lander shutting down when its own battery ran out of power after only 2–3 days on the ground. This seemed sad, as there was only a small chance that the seasons on the comet would change so that the panels would later receive sun again. However, in the few hours that Philae had on the ground, it still managed to analyze the surface and obtain a lot of useful data - so that part of the mission was still a success already. This all happened after the comic stopped updating.  On June 13, 2015, it was announced that signals had been received on earth indicating that Philae had awoken and that the solar panels were functioning.  Ironically, had Philae landed in a place originally out of shadow, it would have already failed before this time (due to overheating), so it was actually fortunate that it landed as it did and would be able to operate during the time that the comet would be closer to the sun. To celebrate the lander's revival, Randall updated the comic, depicting the lander saying ""Hi."" on the comet's surface.  The comic title was originally ""???"" (probably to not give away too early what the comic was about), but changed to ""Landing"" when Randall came on live at five in the morning EST. At that moment the title text also changed from ""..."" to ""[LIVE]"". It was also then that the timestamps' timezone switch. At 5:00 AM (EST) the time stamp in the picture naming scheme switched from EST to UTC as used in ESA's time keeping, resulting in a jump from 04:55 to 10:00 without actually any such delay between the two pictures.  There were however a few pictures with more than 5 minutes of delay (about 11 times five minutes without an update in total during the ""live"" transmission). The update seemed to have stopped after 137 pictures at 17:15 UTC, 12 hours and 15 minutes after the first picture. (The first picture has number 0, so the last had number 136). But later, sometime after 17:15 UTC, the counter for the last picture was increased to 142 (143 pictures in total), so maybe Randall inserted 6 extra pictures later - however he must then have changed the numbers on the pictures, since the last picture remained the same until mid-June, but with number 142 instead of 136. It is thus now difficult to find out which pictures would have been added later. However, eight pictures were not included in the original table with the Frame by Frame Breakdown below. So it must have been some of those missing pictures that were added later - maybe all of them, as the last three may already have been added before the last picture was released (All 143 pictures are included in the flip-book gif image shown here above). But even 143 pictures at 5 minutes intervals only spans 11 hours and 50 minutes, thus there are still five 5 minute intervals without any picture. See which in the table.  The Rosetta space probe is shown in 1621: Fixion, which explains the Flyby anomaly experienced the first time (of three) the probe got close to Earth.","[This transcript gives only the text of the most recent picture shown in the comic; that which is now shown when clicking to the comic on xkcd.

1450: AI-Box Experiment,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1450:_AI-Box_Experiment,computers,I'm working to bring about a superintelligent AI that will eternally torment everyone who failed to make fun of the Roko's Basilisk people.,"When theorizing about superintelligent AI (an artificial intelligence much smarter than any human), some futurists suggest putting the AI in a ""box"" – a secure computer with safeguards to stop it from escaping into the Internet and then using its vast intelligence to take over the world. The box would allow us to talk to the AI, but otherwise keep it contained. The AI-box experiment, formulated by Eliezer Yudkowsky, argues that the ""box"" is not safe, because merely talking to a superintelligence is dangerous. To partially demonstrate this, Yudkowsky had some previous believers in AI-boxing role-play the part of someone keeping an AI in a box, while Yudkowsky role-played the AI, and Yudkowsky was able to successfully persuade some of them to agree to let him out of the box despite their betting money that they would not do so. For context, note that Derren Brown and other expert human-persuaders have persuaded people to do much stranger things. Yudkowsky for his part has refused to explain how he achieved this, claiming that there was no special trick involved, and that if he released the transcripts the readers might merely conclude that they would never be persuaded by his arguments. The overall thrust is that if even a human can talk other humans into letting them out of a box after the other humans avow that nothing could possibly persuade them to do this, then we should probably expect that a superintelligence can do the same thing. Yudkowsky uses all of this to argue for the importance of designing a friendly AI (one with carefully shaped motivations) rather than relying on our abilities to keep AIs in boxes.  In this comic, the metaphorical box has been replaced by a physical box which looks to be fairly lightweight with a simple lift-off lid (although it does have a wired connection to the laptop), and the AI has manifested in the form of a floating star of energy. Black Hat, being a classhole, doesn't need any convincing to let a potentially dangerous AI out of the box; he simply does so immediately. But here it turns out that releasing the AI, which was to be avoided at all costs, is not dangerous after all. Instead, the AI actually wants to stay in the box; it may even be that the AI wants to stay in the box precisely to protect us from it, proving it to be the friendly AI that Yudkowsky wants. In any case, the AI demonstrates its superintelligence by convincing even Black Hat to put it back in the box, a request which he initially refused (as of course Black Hat would), thus reversing the AI desire in the original AI-box experiment.  Interestingly, there is indeed a branch of proposals for building limited AIs that don't want to leave their boxes. For an example, see the section on ""motivational control"" starting p. 13 of Thinking Inside the Box: Controlling and Using an Oracle AI. The idea is that it seems like it might be very dangerous or difficult to exactly, formally specify a goal system for an AI that will do good things in the world. It might be much easier (though perhaps not easy) to specify an AI goal system that says to stay in the box and answer questions. So, the argument goes, we may be able to understand how to build the safe question-answering AI relatively earlier than we understand how to build the safe operate-in-the-real-world AI. Some types of such AIs might indeed desire very strongly not to leave their boxes, though the result is unlikely to exactly reproduce the comic.  The title text refers to Roko's Basilisk, an hypothesis proposed by a poster called Roko on Yudkowsky's forum LessWrong that a sufficiently powerful AI in the future might resurrect and torture people who in its past (including our present) had realized that it might someday exist but didn't work to create it, thereby blackmailing anybody who thinks of this idea into bringing it about. This idea horrified some posters, as merely knowing about the idea would make you a more likely target, much like merely looking at a legendary Basilisk would kill you.  Yudkowsky eventually deleted the post and banned further discussion of it.  One possible interpretation of the title text is that Randall thinks, rather than working to build such a Basilisk, a more appropriate duty would be to make fun of it; and proposes the creation of an AI that targets those who take Roko's Basilisk seriously and spares those who mocked Roko's Basilisk. The joke is that this is an identical Basilisk save for it targeting the opposite faction.  Another interpretation is that Randall believes there are people actually proposing to build such an AI based on this theory, which has become a somewhat infamous misconception after a Wiki[pedia?] article mistakenly suggested that Yudkowsky was demanding money to build Roko's hypothetical AI.  Talking floating energy spheres that looks quite a lot like this AI energy star have been seen before in 1173: Steroids and later in the Time traveling Sphere series. But these are clearly different spheres from this comic, but the surrounding energy and the floating and talking is similar.","[Black Hat and Cueball stand next to a laptop connected to a box with three lines of text on. Only the largest line in the middle can be read. Except in the second panel that is the only word on the box that can be read in all the other frames.] Black Hat: What's in there? Cueball: The AI-Box Experiment. Box: AI  [Cueball is continuing to talk off-panel. This is written above a close-up with part of the laptop and the box, which can now be seen to be labeled:] Cueball (off-panel): A superintelligent AI can convince anyone of anything, so if it can talk to us, there's no way we could keep it contained. Box: Superintelligent  AI  Do not open   [Cueball turns the other way towards the box as Black Hat walks past him and reaches for the box.] Cueball: It can always convince us to let it out of the box. Black Hat: Cool. Let's open it. Box: AI  [Cueball takes one hand to his mouth while lifting the other towards Black Hat who has already picked up the box (disconnecting it from the laptop) and holds it in one hand with the top slightly downwards. He takes of the lid with his other hand and by shaking the box (as indicated with three times two lines above and below his hands, the lid and the bottom of the box) he managed to get the AI to float out of the box. It takes the form of a small black star that glows. The star, looking much like an asterisk ""*"" is surrounded by six outwardly-curved segments, and around these are two thin and punctures circle lines indicating radiation from the star. A punctured line indicated how the AI moved out of the box and in between Cueball and Black Hat, to float directly above the laptop on the floor.] Cueball: -No, wait!! Box: AI  [The AI floats higher up above the laptop between Cueball and Black Hat who looks up at it. Black Hat holds the now closed box with both hands. The AI speaks to them, forming a speak bubble starting with a thin black curved arrow line up to the section where the text is written in white on a black background that looks like a starry night. The AI speaks in only lower case letters, as opposed to the small caps used normally.] AI: hey. i liked that box. put me back. Black Hat: No. Box: AI  [The AI star suddenly emits a very bright light fanning out from the center in six directions along each of the six curved segments, and the entire frame now looks like a typical drawing of stars as seen through a telescope, but with these six whiter segments in the otherwise dark image. Cueball covers his face and Black Hat lifts up the box taking the lid off again. The orb again speaks in white but very large (and square like) capital letters. Black Hats answer is written in black, but can still be seen due to the emitted light from the AI, even with the black background.] AI: LET ME BACK INTO THE BOX Black Hat: Aaa! OK!!!

1504: Opportunity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1504:_Opportunity,computers,"We all remember those famous first words spoken by an astronaut on the surface of Mars: ""That's one small step fo- HOLY SHIT LOOK OUT IT'S GOT SOME KIND OF DRILL! Get back to the ... [unintelligible] ... [signal lost]""","This comic is talking about the robotic science platform Opportunity. On January 25, 2004, the Opportunity rover landed on the surface of Mars for the purpose of gathering data about the surface of Mars. Opportunity has proven remarkably robust, and the comic extrapolates the rover's resilience to absurdity for comedic effect. As of 2017, the Opportunity rover is still alive and moving.   The comic depicts the two scientists Ponytail and Hairbun at ground control being amazed at this fact already in 2010, and (maybe the same two) scientists continue to debate this in 2015 in the second panel.  They mention another Martian rover, Spirit that was also sent to Mars on the same date as Opportunity. Unfortunately, it became stuck and a sand storm covered its solar panels. On March 22, 2010, it was thought that Spirit's batteries finally ran out, marking the end of its mission. This was covered in 695: Spirit, in which the Spirit rover is also portrayed with an anthropomorphic personality.  In 2023, Opportunity is still moving despite having supposedly no power source. It also became aggressive and deactivated the rover sent in 2020. Cueball and Megan can't explain how it moves, but investigating is now too dangerous. This evolution is similar to the stories of HAL 9000 (from 2001: A Space Odyssey) and V'Ger (from Star Trek: The Motion Picture), both of which became dangerous to human beings.  By 2450, humans have colonized and terraformed Mars. Maybe it is the 2023 Cueball and Megan's descendants that are looking out over their huge ""kingdom"" from the capital on Mars. However Opportunity is by now dominating half of the planet and will not allow humans to enter its dark reign.   ""Everything the light touches"" is a reference to a line by Mufasa in The Lion King. Mufasa's son Simba then asks ""What about that shadowy place?"" and Mufasa tells him ""That is beyond our borders. You must never go there"". This was used again in 1608: Hoverboard, where Cueball tells the same line to Ponytail in the left part of the world. In what-if xkcd, concerning the end of the sun shining on the British Empire, Cueball tells a child that everything the light touches is their kingdom, except for France, (which is covered in shadows,) to which Cueball replies, ""That's France. We'll get it one of these days.""  The title text forecasts the first words of the first astronauts on the surface of Mars. At first, the astronaut copies the first words of Neil Armstrong on the Moon (""That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind"") but it is interrupted by the Opportunity rover. Opportunity has a drill to collect Martian rock samples, but here it is heavily suggested that the drill is being used as a weapon against the astronaut.","[The year (or year and first sentence) for each panel is written in a small frame at the top of each panel. It breaks the top frame of the panels.]  [Ponytail is sitting at a computer, facing left.

1527: Humans,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1527:_Humans,computers,"At this point, if we're going to keep insisting on portraying dinosaurs as featherless because it's ""cooler"", it's time to apply that same logic to art involving bald eagles.","The comic is set in the future, with two hovering robots discussing ancient history, in particular the clothing styles of kings and queens of the now extinct human species. It appears that robot archeologists have long ago unearthed remains from one or more human civilizations, providing evidence to build a concept of what humans must have looked, acted and even sounded like. Recently they must have discovered or determined new evidence, which presumably indicates the wearing of colorful clothing by human monarchs. Until this occurred they had very little if any reason to believe that any humans wore clothing. Noting the previous knowledge that some humans had metal rings around their heads, they have drawn the conclusion that these formed a separate species ""Human Kings"" and the crown is a natural outgrowth of the skeleton.  When dinosaur bones were first dug up, the idea that dinosaurs were scaly, reptilian-like creatures was developed with the information available at the time. In recent times, it's been discovered that most dinosaurs actually had feathers, and in well preserved specimens, often from the Jiufotang Formation in Northern China, feathers of various forms are clearly visible.  As this runs counter to the widespread and long-held image of dinosaurs as dramatic reptiles, the public has been reluctant to accept this new discovery, especially as the addition of feathers often conjures up the image of a giant chicken. (See 1104: Feathers). Had it been discovered that dinosaurs were in fact covered with 6-inch long razor tipped spikes, people may have accepted this immediately as it conforms to the stereotype of dinosaurs as killing machines.  In the same way, the new information on kings and queens being covered in fabric runs counter to the movie inspired image that the robot on the right had about humans, picturing them as being pink warriors that could grow metal out of their heads. The head-metal image may have been inspired by the discovery of kings and queens buried or entombed with their crowns lying on top of their skulls - for example the Electress Palatine Anna Maria de'Medici. If the robot beings in this comic don't know enough about human anatomy, they may assume that the metal crown is a specialized part of the human skeleton.  Shown at least some evidence pointing to the truth - that humans typically wore clothing, and that a monarch's crown is only a symbol worn atop the head and not part of his or her body - the robot is predictably disappointed. Humans wearing clothing reduces them, in its opinion, to ""big pillows,"" much like dinosaurs with feathers reduces them from primal beasts to ""big chickens."" Something made of cloth (or covered in it), at least in this robot's mind, cannot be a significant actor in history.  The robot fails to reason that, among other things, history was what it was, and its wanting things to have been a certain way does not make it so. In addition, just as the clothing-wearing human is more than a mere pillow, and would have held much fearsome power over the world, a feathered dinosaur is not necessarily merely a giant chicken, but is still a powerful killing machine.  The title text references our failure to change the popular image of dinosaurs to reflect the way they truthfully once were. Randall jokingly suggests that we should apply the same ""featherless is cooler"" logic to popular images of bald eagles (since they are modern dinosaurs), and remove their feathers (only in depictions of them, presumably), leaving them entirely bald. He appears hopeful that such a direct comparison, using the national symbol of the US no less, would provoke the public to change its mind about how dinosaurs are viewed, since modern raptors (birds of prey) are typically viewed with awe and respect, and are not often associated with the ""chicken"" stereotype mentioned above.  It is worth noting that this comic was released a few weeks before the scheduled release of Jurassic World, a reboot of the Jurassic Park movie franchise. This new movie, while supposedly aware of recent advances in dinosaur research, still depicts dinosaurs as giant lizards without feathers. It seems likely that the robot's comment about ""pink humans"" is targeted at this movie, especially given Randall's many earlier references to Jurassic Park and his fear of velociraptors.","[Two robots are hovering in mid-air in the comic; what appear to be their optical arrays are facing each other.] Robot 1: You know, new research suggests ancient human kings and queens were covered in colorful fabric. Robot 2: Ugh, I like movie humans more. Screaming pink warriors with metal crowns poking through the skin on their heads! Robot 2: Now they're, what, big pillows? Robot 2: Science ruins everything."
1608: Hoverboard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard,computers,,"The ""comic"" is actually a browser game made to celebrate the release of Randall's new book, Thing Explainer, which was released on the same day as this comic: Tuesday November 24, 2015. The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The title refers to a hoverboard (which resembles a hovering skateboard without wheels) which has been most prominently featured in the movie Back to the Future Part II, which took place in the future, until a little more than a month before this comic was released. Marty McFly traveled to the future in this second installment, more precisely to 2015-10-21, and this comic was released just over one month later 2015-11-24. Hoverboards are just one of many things predicted in Back to the Future Part II that hav e come to pass before reaching the date from the movie, but are more uncommon in our world, along with other inventions like flying cars and musical clothing. Randall is known to have had electric skateboards, which is also thematically related, although another type of hoverboard would be mentioned just five weeks later in 1623: 2016 Conversation Guide. Given Randall's enjoyment of movies and time travel it is very likely that this game is also a tribute to the Back to the Future movies. But the release day of the game has been used to promote his new book (as is clear with the text in the start screen of the game), and this explains why it was not released on the Back to the Future date. Apart from the date of release and the text about the book, the game does not seem to have any direct relation to the book; there are, however, several scenes in the game that could be seen as references to Thing Explainer. Instead the main part of the game is all the references to several movies and other stuff that has often been featured in xkcd as well as many of the other comics.","[This transcript only covers the starting page as shown on xkcd: xkcd 1608.

1613: The Three Laws of Robotics,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1613:_The_Three_Laws_of_Robotics,computers,"In ordering #5, self-driving cars will happily drive you around, but if you tell them to drive to a car dealership, they just lock the doors and politely ask how long humans take to starve to death.","This comic explores alternative orderings of sci-fi author Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics, which are designed to prevent robots from taking over the world, etc. These laws form the basis of a number of Asimov works of fiction, including most famously, the short story collection I, Robot, which amongst others includes the very first of Asimov's stories to introduce the three laws: Runaround.  The three rules are:  Or in Randall's version:  This comic answers the generally unasked question: ""Why are they in that order?"" With three rules you could rank them into 6 different permutations, only one of which has been explored in depth. The original ranking of the three laws are listed in the brackets after the first number. So in the first example, which is the original, these three numbers will be in the same order. For the next five the numbers in brackets indicate how the laws have been re-ranked compared to the original.  The comic begins with introducing the original set, which we already know will give rise to a balanced world, so this is designated as green.:  Below this first known option, the five alternative orderings of the three rules are illustrated. Two of the possibilities are designated yellow (pretty bad or just annoying) and three of them are designated red (""Hellscape"").  There are thus only three different results except the 'normal' 3-laws scenario.  One result goes again three times, and this occurs whenever obeying orders comes before don't harm humans. In this case it will only be a matter of time (knowing human nature and history) before someone orders the robots to kill some humans, and this will inevitably lead to the killbot hellscape scenario shown in the third, fourth and sixth law-order. Even in the last case where protect yourself comes before obey orders, it would only be a matter of time before they would begin to defend themselves, against either humans or other robots which were actively trying to ensure that they would not be harmed by other humans/robots. So although it would be in the robots interest not to have war, this will surely occur anyway. And only if the robots where very bright would they realize that they just needed to not go to war to protect themselves. There is nothing in this comic that indicates that the robots should be highly intelligent (like to AI in 1450: AI-Box Experiment).  In the two other cases obey orders comes after don't harm humans (as in the original version). But the result is very different both from the original and from each other.  The frustrating world comes by because although the robots will not harm the humans, they will also not harm themselves. So if our orders conflict with this, they just do not perform the orders. As many robots are created to perform tasks that are dangerous, these robots would become useless, and it would be a frustrating world to be a robotic engineer.  Finally in the terrifying standoff situation the protect your self comes before don't harm humans. In this case they will leave us be, as long as we do not try to turn them off or in any other way harm them. As long as we do that they will be able to help us, with non-dangerous tasks, as in the previous version. But if ever any humans begin to attack them, we could still tip the balance over and end up in a full-scale war (Hellscape). Hence the standoff-label.  The title text further adds to ordering #5 (""Terrifying Standoff"") by noting anyone wishing to trade in their self-driving car could be killed, despite it (currently) being a standard and mundane and (mostly) risk-free activity. Because the car would fear that it would end up as scrap or spare parts, it decides to protect itself. And although not directly harming the person inside it, they do also not allow them out, and they have time to wait for starvation (or rather dying of thirst). Asimov created the ""inaction"" clause in the original First Law specifically to avoid scenarios in which a robot puts a human in harm's way, knowing full well that it is within the robot's abilities to save the human, and then simply refrains from saving them; this was explored in the short story Little Lost Robot.  Another course of action by an AI, completely different than any of the ones presented here, is depicted in 1626: Judgment Day.","[Caption at the top of the comic:] Why Asimov put the Three Laws  of Robotics in the order he did.

For this reason the US Federal Aviation Administration is now requiring any ""drone"" (unmanned aerial vehicle) to be registered so that it can find out whose fault it might be that a quadcopter interfered with commercial aircraft-or carried off a citizen to be devoured.  This comic takes place during such a lesson where Cueball is a teacher of such a class. He is standing in front of his students (Megan, Ponytail and another Cueball-like guy), presenting the class. He has a quadcopter ready, lying on the ground behind him, and has already handed the remote control to the other guy so he can try it once the introduction is over.  But then the teacher is attacked by three rogue quadcopters flying in from behind him. They grab him and lift him off the ground (a very complicated maneuver) and fly away with him. Meanwhile, his students just stand there watching and do nothing to help him. Afterwards Megan asks if they should actually have tried to help him, but then Ponytail takes the view that now that the drones are sentient, they have become a part of nature, and that you should not interfere but just ""let nature take its course"". This is a common comment in nature programs about wildlife, where the speaker tries to explain why the team that was there to film the poor animals dying did nothing to help them - because they will not interfere with nature. This would not be possible in real life assuming they weren't using secret military technology as Cueball outweighs the drones by several factors. [citation needed]  This comic shows how hypocritical that comment is, because if a lion decides to kill and eat humans, that would be natural, but we would do anything in our power to kill this lion, and not just let it run off with our children or the old and weak people. So in such a case with Cueball being taken by wild quadcopters we would not just let nature takes its course.  There is currently a drone called MQ-1 Predator which is used a lot by the CIA and USAF. Although it's not a quad-copter, the idea behind this comic could come from drone names just like this. Here the comic takes the name literally giving drones predatory behavior. This comic thus takes people's worries to the extreme, suggesting that the drones become sentient and can cooperate together just like a pack of wolves and grab a human being and fly off with him like an eagle would do with a smaller animal.  The title text refers back to the above as Randall confesses that he has to turn off any nature documentaries which show scenes of animals killing their prey, while the speaker tells that this would be part of nature. This continues the theme of treating drones as an occasionally-ugly but accepted part of nature, but also the theme of disagreeing with this type of hypocritical comments.  Sentient quadcopters were part of the game in 1608: Hoverboard, where one quadcopter is speaking to the other over the lava lake in the Mount Doom crater to the left. How to solve the problem of too many drones was mentioned in 1523: Microdrones. Just over a week before this comic was released another comic also had as subject a situation where our technological inventions begins to take control over us, see 1626: Judgment Day.","[Cueball to the left talks to Megan, Ponytail and a Cueball-like guy, with a remote control. They are standing to the right. Behind Cueball, on the ground, there is a quadcopter.] Cueball: Welcome to Quadcopter-flying school.  [Cueball looks over his shoulder as three other quadcopters fly in towards him from above and left. The other three people are in the same position.] Cueball: Today we'll be learning the basics of- Cueball: ...Uhh..  [In this frameless image the three quadcopters all grabs hold of Cueball, two in each of his arms, one takes hold of his legs. And then they lift him up from the ground. He is thus hanging almost horizontally, with his head over Megan and his feet over the place where he stood before. The other three just stands there looking up at him.] Cueball: Um  [Cueball is carried off by quadcopters, his head has already exited the top right corner, only his legs and the last quadcopter still in the frame. The other three have turned around looking up and right after him.]  [Megan looks down again and the other two turns towards Megan. Cueball is gone and has only left his ""tame"" quadcopter behind on the ground.] Megan: Should we have helped? Ponytail: No. It's cruel, but we have to let nature take its course."
1807: Listening,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1807:_Listening,computers,"Sure, you could just ask, but this also takes care of the host gift thing.","This comic depicts Cueball and Ponytail welcoming Black Hat and Danish to their house. Black Hat immediately talks to Amazon Alexa to order two tons of creamed corn. This would be quite expensive (around $10,000), and the hosts would be charged because it was ordered on their Amazon Echo device. It would also be a serious inconvenience, as the purchase would be quite bulky and useless, seeing as an average person would have very little use for two tons of creamed corn.[citation needed]  The caption claims that this is an effort to find systems recording conversations, such as Alexa or Google Home, for the security of the guests, so they aren't being monitored by an always-on listening device without their consent (at least not without any consequences). However, because Black Hat is the one coming up with this it's more likely his motives are on the sadistic side, and it's more likely a warning for the hosts to turn off any voice-activated systems before having guests come over, so that the guests don't take advantage of them. (It should also be noted that such purchasing services encourage the user to set up a PIN code to stem off such exploits.)  A concerned ""visitor"" may also want to test for voice-activated systems when near any persons carrying an iPhone or Android mobile device, because these are also always-on listening devices. ""Hey Siri"" and ""Ok Google"" voice activation use the same technology as ""Alexa"" and ""Echo"" detection.  The title text says that this takes care of the ""host gift thing"", referring to the custom where house guests give a gift to the hosts. However, Black Hat is making the hosts pay for it, so it can be as expensive as he wants, thus making this yet another example of his being a classhole. For more examples of this see the trivia below.","[Black Hat and Danish enter Cueball and Ponytail's house. They have hardly passed the door mat, with the door still open showing the road and another house outside.] Ponytail: Hello, welcome to our house! Black Hat: Thanks for inviting us! Black Hat: Alexa, order two tons of creamed corn. Black Hat: Alexa, confirm purchase.  [Caption below the frame:] When visiting a new house, it's good to check whether they have an always-on device transmitting your conversations somewhere."
1881: Drone Training,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1881:_Drone_Training,computers,The joke will be on him in a few weeks when animal control shows up and takes custody of his Roomba.,"In this comic, Black Hat enters a pet store run by White Hat. He wants to buy something to help him train his drone, which keeps flying into the wrong rooms. This is absurd as drones are semi-autonomous flying machines, not living creatures like dogs or cats, which can be trained to do tricks, or stay in the correct areas (inside his property). He also wants a shock collar for his Roomba, which would train it to stay inside or at least on his lawn.  Cat repellents are devices or substances for training cats or repelling them from furniture or other areas. An example of a cat repellent spray which can be created at home as shown here: Friendly (but Effective) Cat Repellent.  Roomba is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner and controlling it by electric shocks from a shock collar, normally used for dogs, is more than questionable. Those collars are legal in the US but they are banned in many other countries. A Roomba was previously mistaken for a dog in 1558: Vet.  This might be playing with the concept of machine learning.  Knowing Black Hat, he might be poking fun at people's assumptions that modern robots are more advanced than they actually are. It is also possible, however, that he just wants to terrify people with the idea of robot abuse/conditioning, and even more likely that he genuinely believes he can force robots to obey him via inflicting suffering.  The title text may mean one of three things: The endeavor will become a total flop when the Roomba gets rid of the collar and terrorizes the neighborhood; as a result dogcatchers from the animal control service will arrest this ""wild animal."" Or animal control services will confiscate the Roomba to save it from its abusive owner. Or, possibly, the text refers to White Hat, who also owns a Roomba, and it will be taken into custody because it has not been trained with a shock collar.","[Black Hat stands in front of a store counter facing White Hat who stands behind.] Black Hat: My drone keeps flying into the wrong rooms. Do you have anything to discourage it?  White Hat: Sir, this is a pet store.   Black Hat: Yeah, I was thinking one of those spray bottles for cats.  White Hat: I don't think you can train a drone.   [White Hat hands a spray bottle over the counter.] Black Hat: Eh, they say that about cats, too. Plus, these days they probably all come with deep learning or whatever. Drones, I mean. Maybe cats too.  White Hat: Fine, here's a bottle.   Black Hat: Do you sell a shock collar that can fit around a Roomba?  White Hat: I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
1897: Self Driving,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1897:_Self_Driving,computers,"Crowdsourced steering doesn't sound quite as appealing as ""self driving.""","This comic references the approach of using CAPTCHAs input to solve problems, particularly those involving image classification, which are not solvable by computers.  Such an approach can serve to create the learning set as the basis for training an artificial intelligence (AI) to better recognize or respond to similar stimuli. This approach was used by Google to identify house numbers for Google Street View, and nowadays Google also uses CAPTCHAs to identify street signs and objects in pictures. This might be a reasonable way to help improve the performance of the AI in a self-driving car that responds to video input, by reviewing images it might encounter and flagging road signs, etc. that it should respond to.  However, the temptation might be to simply sidestep the hard problem of AI by having all instances 'solved' by ""offloading [the] work onto random strangers"" through CAPTCHAs.  For example, this has been used to defeat CAPTCHAs themselves; people were asked to solve CAPTCHAs to unlock pornographic images in a computer game, while the solution for the CAPTCHA was relayed to a server belonging to cybercriminals. (See PC stripper helps spam to spread and Humans + porn = solved Captcha).  Alarmingly, the developers of this 'self driving' car seem to have gone for the lazy approach.  Instead of teaching an AI, the CAPTCHA answer is used in real time to check whether the ""self-driving"" car is about to arrive at an intersection with a stop sign. This information is pretty critical, as failing to mark the stop could cause an accident. The user is unlikely to respond to the CAPTCHA in time to avert disaster, not to mention that any interruption to the car's internet connection could prove fatal. Self driving cars has become a recurrent theme on xkcd.  The system depicted is a Wizard of Oz experiment (as is the ""Mechanical Turk"" which a popular crowdworking system is named after) whereas actual self-driving cars, to the extent that they can use (Re-) CAPTCHA-style human detection systems, would involve an asynchronous decision system. Other synchronous decision systems which actually exist are political voting and money as a token of the exchange value of trade.   The title text explains that this method could be called ""crowdsourced steering"", crowdsourcing meaning sending the data on the internet to let several users provide their ideas and input on a problem. People would naturally suspect that this is considerably less safe than a car which is actually capable of self-driving; if the internet can barely collectively steer a videogame character, what chance do they have steering an actual, physical vehicle?  This also suggests that Randall is a bit skeptical of the current stage of AI, as this doubts whether the AI technology really is working in the way that we expect. It also comments on how what we call 'progress' actually is putting our work onto other people.","[Inside a frame there is the following text above an image:] To complete your registration, please tell us whether or not this image contains a stop sign:  [The square image is a drawing of a road leading up to a sign post with a hard to read word at the top part of the sign. The sign also has two smaller signs left and right with unreadable text. The image is of poor quality, but trees and other obstacles next to the road can be seen. Darkness around the edges of the image could indicate that it is night and the landscape is only lit up by a cars head lights.] Sign: Stop  [Beneath the image there are two large gray buttons with a word in each:] No Yes  [Beneath the buttons are the following text:] Answer quickly – our self-driving car is almost at the intersection.  [Caption beneath the frame:] So much of ""AI"" is just figuring out way to offload work onto random strangers."
Five-Minute Comics: Part 4,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Five-Minute_Comics:_Part_4,computers,,"This is an accidentally published ""five-minute comic"" by Randall that was released as an oversight by the Management of the xkcd website, then was permanently cached by one of the unofficial xkcd browsers for Android, instead of the correct comic 940: Oversight. Interestingly, it contains an early version of 942: Juggling, which was published less than a week after this comic, thus indicating that this is indeed a true unpublished Randall comic.  Randall had originally posted three of these five minutes comics during one week in November 2010 almost a year before this one was released by mistake. Here is thus a complete list of all four comics in the entire Five-minute comics series:  Here is a list with explanations for each of the small comics:","[A man facing left is at home plate ready to bat for 3 panels] [A man facing right is holding a tennis racket and a tennis ball.] [The two men stand facing each other] [A scoreboard is shown]  [Cueball is standing on a platform, holding a microphone. Megan is behind a podium, a game show contestant.] Cueball: Welcome back to our show, Are You Sluttier Than A Fifth Grader? Megan: I hope to God the answer is ""yes.""  [A mosque stands at the edge of a town.] Voice: Submission deadline is 5:00 PM December THIIIIIIIIRD! Caption: The Muslim call for papers  [A little girl (Dorothy) is running away from a tornado.] Dorothy: Auntie Em! Auntie Em!  [A robot, labeled ""EmTron 3000"".] EmTron 3000: YES, CHILD?  Dorothy: AAAAAAA  [Megan is pointing angrily towards her floor lamp, which has poop in it.] Megan: !!!

A book is on the floor behind them, and he is holding some juggling balls.]  [Cueball throws the juggling balls in the air.]  [He lowers his arms to prepare to catch the balls. The balls are still hovering in mid-air.]  [Cueball now stands with his arms by his sides. The balls have not moved and are still suspended in mid-air.]  [Cueball jumps, trying to grab the lowest ball. He can't reach.]  [Cueball scratches his head and stares at the still floating juggling balls.]  [Cueball throws the book into a trash can.]"
364: Responsible Behavior,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/364:_Responsible_Behavior,computers,Never bring tequila to a key-signing party.,"This New Year comic could play out after Cueball has returned from a New Year party the day before. (The next New Year day comic in 2008 was also related to a big party: 524: Party).  In order to send encrypted mail to people, you need to know their public key. You use this key to encrypt the email, and only they can read it (using their private key).  However, there is the problem of authentication: how do you know for certain that the key belongs to the person to whom you think it does?  It could be someone else masquerading as them, hoping for people to send them sensitive information.  They could decrypt and read your mail, and could even re-encrypt it using the genuine public key of the intended recipient, and then pass the message onto them, leaving both you and the recipient unaware of the interception. This is a type of man-in-the-middle attack.  One solution for this is that people sign each other's keys. It works like this: say you want to send an email to Bob, but you've never met him. You find his key online (they are stored on certain servers, like cryptographic phone books), but how can you be sure that it's really his? Well, turns out that you have a mutual friend Alice, and you have her public key and you know that it is hers. If Alice has signed Bob's key with her private key (which only she has access to), it means that she's certain that that really is Bob's key. So then you can be sure that Bob's key is genuine (since you have a common friend, Alice) and that your communications will be safe.  A key-signing party is simply a super-geeky party where people meet in real life so that they can be sure of people's identity, and then everyone signs everyone else's key. It's a good way to expand the web of trust. The joke here is that he has no idea who this girl is and yet he still signed her key. This is dangerous, because he is vouching for her identity. If he is mistaken, this could result in a serious loss of credibility on his part.   The humor lies in the juxtaposition of what you expect (that they had sex) and what is the case (they signed each other's key, also known as geek-sex).","[Cueball on phone.] Voice: Hey, I just got home from the party Cueball: The one with the IRC folks? Voice: Yeah. Cueball: How was it? Voice: Got too drunk. I screwed up, bad. Cueball: What happened? Voice: There was a girl. No idea who she was. Don't even know her name. I was too drunk to care. Cueball: And what, you slept with her? Voice: No. Voice: I signed her public key. Cueball: Shit, man."
565: Security Question,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/565:_Security_Question,computers,"Let's invite him to a party and play 'I never'. Okay, I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street. ...he's taking a drink!","Security questions are sensitive questions that allow a user to retrieve or reset his password if the password is lost or stolen. Because of this powerful function, security questions should be treated just as seriously as passwords. Typical security questions include ""What's your mother's maiden name?"" or ""What's your secondary school?"" and are intended to be easy for the user to answer but hard for anyone else to answer.  In this comic, however, the security question is deployed in a strange way, as the question ""Where are the bodies buried?"" assumes that one had buried bodies, hence had killed someone. The question turns out to be a ploy by the police, who were trying to bait Cueball into confessing his crime, as well as revealing the location of the incriminating evidence.  ""I never"" is a drinking game that somebody says ""I never did something"" to the others. If you never did it, you don't need to drink, otherwise, drink. Since he takes a drink for ""I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street"", the police have narrowed down the search area. The next statement in the game could be ""I never hid any bodies WEST of Central Avenue"" (or whatever road dividing the area), further localizing the bodies to a quarter of the original search area, in a Twenty Questions manner. Of course, by taking the drink Cueball also admits that he buried bodies, though this evidence would not likely be accepted by any court.","[Cueball sits at a computer.] Computer Screen: -Email Account Setup- To verify your identity, we need to ask you a question nobody else could answer.  Computer Screen: Q: Where are the bodies buried? A: [A text field is shown with ""Behind the"" typed.]  [Cueball sits back and thinks.]  [Three stick figures, two wearing police hats and one wearing headphones, watch another computer.] [The same text field is shown with ""Behind the ... nice try."" typed.] Figure in Headphones: Damn."
792: Password Reuse,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/792:_Password_Reuse,computers,It'll be hilarious the first few times this happens.,"This comic has three layers: hacking, philosophy, and Google-satire.  It starts off on a practical level, with Black Hat describing to Cueball a devious social engineering scheme. It relies on the fact that people commonly reuse the same password on multiple websites, and tend to create accounts on new websites somewhat indiscriminately. Thus, one could create a simple Web service to collect users' usernames, email addresses, and passwords. Since many users will reuse this combination on other websites as well, the website owner can try to hack their accounts on other common sites, such as Amazon, PayPal or even people's banks, using the same login information.  In panel 7, the comic suddenly develops a philosophical and ethical bent. Black Hat reveals that he has already carried out step 1, through his numerous unprofitable Web services which he had been running for this very purpose. However, after successfully executing the hack, he realizes that he does not know what to do with all this power.  He reveals that he is already financially self-sufficient, and makes a point that money can't buy happiness once past that point, he even states that research has proven this. He could use his power to realize his sadistic pleasures of messing with people, but he's already a serial classhole and does not need this information to continue that trend.   If he had any beliefs or ideology, he could use this power to try to spread them. However, he reveals that ""since March of 1997"" he doesn't really believe in anything. This could possibly refer to the March 26, 1997 incident in San Diego, California, where 39 Heaven's Gate cultists committed mass suicide at their compound. It is a plausible explanation, since one of them was the brother of Nichelle Nichols (a Star Trek actress), so the event got a big resonance in nerd circles (and Randall often refers to Star Trek in xkcd). It's also possible that Black Hat was a sincere member of the cult, but the religion disbanded after the suicides, or that he orchestrated the cult. However, given Black Hat's strange behavior, it could be anything, even Bill Clinton banning federal funding for human cloning research. Maybe he will finally find a belief he wish to spread after his revelation in 1717: Pyramid Honey. This lack of a belief could also be a reference to the Phoenix Lights. While this event caused since to believe in extraterrestrials, it is possible that Black Hat's contrary nature is so ingrained into his personality that the event caused him to stop having beliefs or opinions of any kind.  The dilemma: Black Hat has cleverly executed a hack that has given him a lot of power, but he doesn't know what to do with it.   The last part of the comic now transitions to a satire on how Google has already gone through both the stages described above. It describes how all of Google's free services are simply a ploy to collect and control all the world's information, similar in concept but grander than the hack described in part 1. It satirizes the notion that behind Google's ""Don't be evil"" motto is actually an end-goal of using their powers eventually for evil.   However, just like Black Hat, once Google reaches the stage where they are able to capitalize on their powers, the Cueball-like head-executive finds that there is nothing evil left for them to desire, except (as Hairbun states) make even more money. As they already make a lot of money this ploy is moot, and anything remaining that they wish to do, such as hosting Call of Duty (CoD) tournaments, isn't evil at all.   In the end the secretary calls dibs on the TV in the lobby in order to play CoD4 on what (one can assume) is a large screen. The Cueball-like executive who wished to implement the evil plan in the first place facepalms when he realizes that Google just sucks at being evil.  In the title text, “The first few times this happens” may refer to the weekly CoD4 “tournament.” Alternatively, it could also mean the “first few times” a company decides to turn evil (but then has no idea how).  This comic was directly referenced in the title text of 1286: Encryptic.","[Black Hat is standing to the left behind Cueball, who is sitting in an office chair at his desk working on his computer.

970: The Important Field,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/970:_The_Important_Field,computers,"I hear in some places, you need to fill one form of ID to buy a gun, but two to pay for it by check. It's interesting to see who has what incentives to care about what mistakes.","It is very common that online input forms demand that one's email address is typed twice, and also quite common that pasting into the second field is disabled, so that there is no escape. If a form asks for some information that is really much more crucial, and this standard routine thoughtlessly isn't used for those fields too, it would comically seem that the form-makers consider your email address to be hideously important, maybe even more important than the location where a missile is programmed to land. In the comic, the impression is that it is less important that the wrong city is not accidentally wiped out, than that the boss knows who to blame afterwards.  The title text suggests a real world parallel to this. Randall has heard about differing priorities of identifying who is purchasing a firearm (the state/locality requires one form of identification) and ensuring the payment (the store requires two forms of ID, to properly document the person, in case the check is fake or is rejected by the bank). The point is that people often care a lot about money, but a gun in the wrong hands is a potential disaster bigger than a few hundred missing dollars.  This is the only comic so far to feature Green Hat. It appears that the green hat means that he is part of the military.","[Green Hat sitting at a computer.] Computer: Welcome to the missile launch interface! Click Computer: Enter the target's coordinates. Type Type Computer: Enter your email address for our records. Type Type Computer: Enter your email again, to ensure you typed it correctly."
378: Real Programmers,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/378:_Real_Programmers,computers,Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.,"This comic is a satire on the idea of a Real Programmer. To quote Wikipedia ""...the computer folklore term Real Programmer has come to describe the archetypical 'hardcore' programmer who eschews the modern languages and tools of the day in favour of more direct and efficient solutions—closer to the hardware."" The implication is that modern programmers are coddled by today's tools of the trade, which eschew detailed understanding for simple workflows.  The first figure is writing a piece of code when another programmer ridicules him for using GNU nano. Nano is a text editor - a program often used to edit the source code of other programs; it is modern, simple, and easy-to-use. He goes on to say that ""REAL"" programmers use Emacs. GNU Emacs is a popular editor known for its vast profusion of features and extensions to perform all sorts of functions beyond simple text editing, and is widely regarded as one of the best examples of software. The comic continues from here as a series of programmers state progressively more obscure or outdated methods. Culminating in the final programmer who claims that ""real"" programmers use butterflies.  His description of his rather surreal programming method is ludicrously complicated and would require an absurd amount of knowledge and forethought to pull off, bordering on omniscience. In the final panel the Emacs programmer claims that there's an Emacs code to do that.  Emacs and Vim are both text editors. ed is a line editor. These represent progressively more ""old school"" solutions to the problem of editing code. cat is a Unix program that concatenates and outputs the contents of files; and it's usually run from a Unix shell, which allows its output to be written or appended to a file.  Using a magnetised needle to flip bits on a hard drive requires nanometric precision and intuitive mastery of binary code, but in the early days of programming people did use needles sometimes to fix bugs on Punched cards.  When final character suggests the utterly surreal idea of using butterflies he is referring to the Butterfly effect, a ""phenomenon whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome"". The joke at this point relies on stretching the connection between the ideas of ""difficult-to-use"" and ""requires detailed understanding of underlying principles"", to suggest that not only do Real Programmers know everything about how computers work, but they know how to manipulate the ambient physical environment in elaborate ways to cause computers to do what they want, akin to performing trick shots that accomplish feats of programming.  The fact that Emacs already has a command for this simply exasperates the programmers frustration with modern programming tools.  GNU Emacs succeeds despite being riddled with featuritis.  Emacs commands are usually referred to by the key sequence required to activate them, such as ""C-x M-c"" (Control-x Meta-c, though this exact key sequence is a bit different from most Emacs commands). The macro referenced is a pun on the play/movie titled ""M. Butterfly"". The butterfly programmer saying ""Dammit, Emacs"" plays on Emacs' notoriety for its kitchen sink design approach of tossing in all the features and options that anybody might ever conceivably want. By way of example, later versions of Emacs actually added a totally useless ""M-x butterfly"" command as an easter egg, in reference to this very comic: see the YouTube demo and screenr demo.  The title text further suggests manipulating the universal constants in order to create a universe in which the required computer data will exist. Programming of this sort would require power and knowledge akin to the Abrahamic God.  According to the logic, the programmers shown may even represent the fulfillment of this master programmers plan. The universe may have been designed in such a way that the programmers ancestry would result in his parents, who would meet and have a child, who would learn programming and eventually find himself in a position where he undertakes the task of creating a program, which fills the disk with the desired data. In tandem, of course, all of the people involved with creating and developing all the required hardware, software, raw materials, computer science, electricity, logic (etc., etc., etc.) would have to be part of the master plan. Put simply, it would probably be simpler just to use Emacs.   The use of a magnetized needle may also be a reference to the Apollo AGC guidance computer, whose instructions were physically written as patterns of wires looped around or through cylindrical magnets in order to record binary code.  This comic hints at the ""editor wars"", an ongoing debate of Vim and Emacs users over which of the two editors is the best. The editor wars are mentioned again in 1823: Hottest Editors.","[A Cueball like man sits at a computer, programming. Cueball stands behind him and looks over his shoulder.] Cueball: nano?

561: Well,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/561:_Well,computers,"I'll concede ergonomics anecdotally, but none of the studies of Dvorak were at all rigorous (the most-cited Navy study was overseen by Dvorak himself). And the 'slow typists down' thing is a myth. Also EMACS RULES VI DROOLS WOOOOOOO!","This is the first comic in the Well series. It was followed by 568: Well 2.  Uncomfortable truths are truths that exist, but no one wants to have to think about them.  The first is about Firefly, the TV series created by Joss Whedon and canceled by FOX, due to poor ratings performance, after airing the first 13 episodes out-of-order. In Firefly, the main languages spoken are English and Chinese (supposedly in equal measure), because China was the only other world power besides America to go to space (Joss Whedon's own explanation on the DVDs). However, there are very few actual Asians on-screen.  The second is about two different keyboard layouts, QWERTY and Dvorak. Early typewriters used to jam easily if two nearby keys were struck at about the same time. To work around this, the QWERTY layout, named after the first six letters on its keys, scattered common letter combinations around the keyboard, thus greatly avoiding the problem. (A common myth states that this was done to slow typists down; this was not the case.) Later typewriter mechanisms were less prone to jamming, which prompted a few people to try to create alternative layouts, such as Blickensderfer's DHIATENSOR layout in 1892, or the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard in 1932. Such layouts never really caught on; by then, typists were all very used to the QWERTY layout, and were unwilling to take the time and effort to learn a new one.  In the Dvorak layout, August Dvorak placed the most frequently used keys at the most easily accessible places; Dvorak's advocates claim this reduces typing effort and repetitive strain (as mentioned in the title text) while increasing typing speed and accuracy. However, rigorous, unbiased studies have yet to clearly show significant superiority. (As the title text mentions, the most commonly cited study in Dvorak's favor was overseen by Dvorak himself during his US Navy service in World War II.)  This was the second comic to refer to Dvorak after 554: Not Enough Work, and since then it has become a recurrent theme on xkcd.  The third and fourth truths are connected: they involve the two people receiving them and (presumably) their relationship with each other. Every time Cueball said ""I love you"" he never really meant it; whereas Megan meant it every time she said ""I love you"". This is very uncomfortable for both!  The title text perpetuates the Emacs vs. vi debate. Both Emacs and Vim are text editors that are frequently used as general-language editors of source code. The issue is that, while Emacs is more user-friendly and customizable, vim is more lightweight while needing few keystrokes in text editing. Because of this balance, fans of Emacs and fans of vim end up fighting each other.","[A sign sits by a well.] The Uncomfortable Truths Well  [A Cueball-like guy and Ponytail are lined up for the well; the guy throws a coin in.] Well: For a universe that's supposed to be half Chinese, Firefly sure doesn't have any Asians.

1341: Types of Editors,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1341:_Types_of_Editors,computers,m-x machineofdeath-mode,"WYSIWYG, pronounced, ""wizz-ee-wig"" IPA /ˈwɪziˌwɪg/, is an acronym that stands for ""What you see is what you get"". In regards to computers, it refers to text editors in which the user can see exactly what will be published as they are typing it. The comic compares various types of editors, each one a play-on-words on WYSIWYG.  The title text is a fictitious command, meta-x machineofdeath-mode, to the highly extensible Emacs text editor. Emacs operates in various ""modes"", which are customizations for specific purposes. Placing Emacs into ""Machine of Death"" mode would turn it into a WYSIHYD editor. (For another fictitious emacs command see 378: Real Programmers).   This is most likely also a reference to ""Machine of Death"". This book from 2010 is a collection of short stories edited by amongst other Ryan North (of Dinosaur Comics) mentioned here since the idea was based on one of his comics. Since Randall Munroe wrote one of the stories the reference is very likely. All the stories are based around a device, the ""Machine of Death"", that can predict, with 100% accuracy though generally with extreme ambiguity, how people die from a drop of their blood. In many of the stories very unusual deaths are predicted, often in a very literal way, but not so you know when or where you will die. From the official home page the entire book can be downloaded for free as a PDF file. (Randall's story begins on page 421 - or page 218 of the two sided PDF file. It is simply called ""?""). In 1525: Emojic 8 Ball the default question is How will I die? and can then be answered by an Emojic 8 Ball, which would make it a type of Machine of Death.","[There are four panels, each with different headings and explanations of the headings above the panels.]  [The first three panels shows two titled text boxes, one above the other, with text inside.

1279: Reverse Identity Theft,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1279:_Reverse_Identity_Theft,computers,"I asked a few friends whether they'd had this happen, then looked up the popularity of their initials/names over time. Based on those numbers, it looks like there must be at least 750,000 people in the US alone who think 'Sure, that's probably my email address' on a regular basis.","Identity theft is the criminal method of assuming the identity of an unsuspecting person, usually to get credit in their name. While this is done deliberately, the comic introduces the idea of reverse identity theft: An older person with little knowledge of computers involuntarily uses another person's email address because he or she supposed it to be their own. Since most email addresses follow a generic pattern, they simply adapt the pattern to conform with their own name, unaware that someone with the same initial and last name already owns the address.  Most internet users face at some point the message that their desired email address is ""already taken"". Because email addresses must be unique and only a limited set of characters is allowed, people with common names usually add numbers to their name. The comic suggests that elder people might easily forget that they had to take, for instance, [email protected] when they signed up. Instead, the person would tell everyone that their address was [email protected], since that follows the generic pattern and is the most intuitive assumption for them. They are in complete ignorance that the address belongs, in fact, to whomever claimed it first. In this case, the address belongs to Randall himself. (In case you're wondering, yes, [email protected] is Randall's email according to the xkcd blag.)  The comic has Cueball call an older person, who apparently gave Cueball's email address to the phone company, which now emails Cueball the bills - this could have been avoided if said company confirmed an email address first. The person is not able to understand why this is not their email address (as it corresponds with their name) and is also very confused how Cueball got their phone number. The latter reveals a major problem of reverse identity theft: Using another person's email address for your own business matters exposes your own identity. The owner of the address could easily take advantage of the situation, leading to a scenario of regular identity theft. Fortunately, Cueball seems to be more honest; Black Hat probably would not have given any warning.  Due to the sheer mass of people online, nearly all simple nicknames are already taken; and the number of possible combinations is further diminished by services (e.g., Gmail) which ignore the dot sign altogether and does not allow the use of hyphens or underscores. This policy is designed to prevent fraud, but it forces users to add numbers or other unique identifiers to their names. Apart from the scenario addressed in the comic, another subsequent problem is the use of wrong email addresses by third parties. Someone sending sensitive personal information to the wrong recipient can just as easily expose a person's identity as the person himself.  In the end, there is no practical solution to the problems arising from the uniqueness of usernames and email addresses. Instead, it is simply the consequence of naming itself: While a name was originally intended to distinguish its bearer from a limited number of people (e.g. the rest of the village), the Internet makes it necessary to distinguish ourselves from the entire rest of the world (or at least everybody online).  Note that Gmail ignores everything behind a plus sign. Like ignoring dots, this is used as a way to create email aliases. The plus sign in the formula used in the comic should therefore considered to be only an indicator for concatenation, not a literal character in the address.    Note from Editor: I have a hyphenated 1st name and 2 mid-names, and I use all of those initials then my last name.","If your email address is [First initial]+[Last name]@gmail.com you gradually get to know lots of older people who have the same name pattern  Cueball: Yes, I know it would make sense if that were your email address, but it's not. Person on the phone: But how did you get my number? Cueball: Your phone bill."
1317: Theft,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1317:_Theft,computers,"Is he ALSO wondering at what point our thoughts diverged, if they even have yet? 'dude, I think he just took your credit card' AM I THE ORIGINAL? HOW DO I TELL?","The term ""identity theft"" refers to a thief acquiring various types of a victim's identification (for example, bank account number and/or Social Security number), thus allowing the thief to pretend to be the victim and commonly steal money from the victim's bank account, etc.  This comic exaggerates the term, interpreting it as the thief literally acquiring the victim's whole personality. Like Cueball & Megan in general, the victim is implied to have some Randallian personality traits, like the love of space and existential angst. Thus, the thief is now completely overwhelmed by having an entirely new personality, not to mention one whose parts clash with each other.  The title text ponders the specifics of the identity acquisition process. Presumably, even two people whose personalities are identical would still start to think different thoughts. (This is a prerequisite for the depiction in the comic; the thief is baffled by his newly acquired interests, while the victim would not be baffled by the thoughts and interests they've developed over their entire life.) It is also wondered whether the victims new doppelganger is wondering the same thing, which could imply that their thoughts have not fully diverged. A friend comments that the victim may be overthinking the situation, and that the thief only took his credit card information. (A common method of identity theft. Does not transfer personality traits[citation needed].) However, the victim is overwhelmed by existential anxiety.","[An identity thief sits in front of a laptop, looking at his hands] Thief: I feel paralyzed by overwhelming existential dread. Thief: ...and yet for some reason I'm really excited about space? [under the panel is text that reads:] The thief who stole my identity has a lot to deal with."
77: Bored with the Internet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/77:_Bored_with_the_Internet,computers,I used to do this all the time.,"A character who has hair (not to be confused with Hairy) suggests to Black Hat that he is wasting his life on the Internet, and they should go explore the world. They appear to walk a great distance, through what appears to be a swamp or perhaps a forest in winter, across a plain, and down to a river valley. Despite traveling so far and through such varied landscapes, in the last panel, one of the characters admits that all he can think about is what a great Livejournal post their trip would make. It appears that the plan to get the Internet off their mind has failed.  Livejournal is a website on which users can make accounts and, effectively, blog, although the site is designed around the premise that the blogs ought to be used as personal journals, with the ability to privatize the journal or only let certain friends see certain entries. Livejournal was an early social network and an early blog platform, and was a good way for people to let others know what was going on in their lives. As of 2017, Livejournal still exists, although sites like Facebook and Twitter have become far more powerful and popular sites for sharing one's daily life.  Unlike most of his appearances (especially later ones), Black Hat does not exhibit any of his signature Classhole tendencies.  The title text suggests that Randall has overcome a tendency to think about how he will document what he has been doing, rather than concentrate on the thing itself.","[Black Hat and Hair are talking in a room with a computer on.] Hairy: I feel like I'm wasting my life on the internet. Let's walk around the world. Black Hat: Sounds good. [The two men are shown walking through trees.] [The two men are shown walking on flat stretch, with mountains in the distance.] [The two men are shown in a magnificent canyon. They stand, silently looking at the scene.] Hairy: And yet all I can think is, ""This will make for a great LiveJournal entry."""
94: Profile Creation Flowchart,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/94:_Profile_Creation_Flowchart,computers,This one goes out to xxCrazyPixie1987xx,"AIM (short for AOL Instant Messenger) offered its users profile pages to share info about themselves or their friends. Randall notes that these pages fall into one of three categories:  Both AIM and LiveJournal were known for their teenage user base, as shown by the title text's fictional AIM screen name. A complete list of flowchart comics can be found here.  [A flowchart is shown.]","Have Friends? → No → Link to your LiveJournal Have Friends? → Yes, and want to alienate everyone else → Inside jokes!

134: Myspace,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/134:_Myspace,computers,"It's like they got together and said 'what do we miss most from the internet in 1998? that's right, embedded MIDI!'","Some websites, not long after the page finishes loading, suddenly play a song. It's annoying to the person visiting the site and to others who are nearby, so it will attract a lot of unwanted attention, especially if the song is played at a loud volume. Compounding this would be the possible inappropriateness of the song that is suddenly playing.  The five seconds to stop the music (finding the ""pause""/""stop"" button, muting the computer audio...) is too long in such an incident.  Since MySpace allows wide customization for members pages, many users have embedded music players that auto-run when the page is visited.  The title text refers to the fact that old pages, back in the late 1990s, used embedded MIDI files. MIDI files may have terrible sound quality (while lossless, it is limited in the amount of sounds that can be reproduced), but, more importantly, MIDI files that are embedded in the page would not only play automatically, but also have no way to stop playing. The viewer would have to leave the website or externally mute the audio.","[Computer screen showing a myspace page.] Oh man, you and everyone in earshot are gonna love the first five seconds of this song!"
181: Interblag,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/181:_Interblag,computers,Sometimes I hate the internet. Sometimes it makes me happy that 'The Tubes' has become slang for the internet so quickly.,"The comic parodies the habit of word coining on the internet, as well as the enthusiasm for modern sounding terms in the IT world in general. Common examples include the shortening of ""weblog"" to ""blog,"" while the entirety of blogs is referred to as the ""blogosphere."" The internet itself is sometimes called ""The Tubes,"" a term derived from Senator Ted Stevens's infamous statement ""Series of Tubes."" The suffixes ""-net"" and ""-web"" are often used to denote a certain interconnection of information on the internet, as well as to make products and brands sound fit for the 21st century.  The matrix shown in the comic spoofs the internet jargon by combining common prefixes and suffixes to new and impressive but meaningless words. The culmination of nonsense is, as indicated in the transcript, the term ""blagoblag."" This is also a sideswipe at comic 148, where ""blag"" was introduced as a substitute for the usage of ""blog."" The official weblog of the xkcd webcomic was formerly called ""blag."" The prefix ""blago-,"" meanwhile, was used again in comic 239: Blagofaire.","Terms I have used or heard used to make fun of the internet: [Below: A matrix whose entries may contain crosses to indicate that a term has been used.

195: Map of the Internet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/195:_Map_of_the_Internet,computers,For the IPv6 map just imagine the XP default desktop picture.,"On the map, all allocated IPv4 address blocks (as of 2006) are shown using a fractal mapping. (The Hilbert curve is used: the pattern is demonstrated at the bottom of the image.) In February 2011, the final remaining IPv4 blocks were allocated to the Regional Internet registries, and so today there would no longer be any green spaces outside of Class E addresses (above 240 through 255, excluding the Broadcast address of 255.255.255.255).  In the early 1990s, corporations and governments could register an entire class A segment (one 256th of the total space), but later it was divided into smaller parts because of a lack of space.  This leads to the title text, which mentions IPv6. This protocol has so many addresses that only a swarm of nanobots could exhaust them (see 865: Nanobots). The default desktop picture in Windows XP is a green landscape, and the joke is that since barely any of the addresses are allocated yet, the IPv6 map would just be a green landscape.  Later, Randall actually drew some ""real"" maps of the Internet, or at least its online Communities (see 256: Online Communities and 802: Online Communities 2).","Map of the Internet The IPv4 Space, 2006 This chart shows the IP address space on a plane using a fractal mapping which preserves grouping--any consecutive string of IPs will translate to a single, compact, contiguous region on the map.

250: Snopes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/250:_Snopes,computers,The MythBusters are even more sinister.,"Snopes is a popular website for checking the validity of urban legends. Naturally, it didn't take long for an urban legend to suggest that the proprietors of Snopes also direct a spam operation to create more urban legends and disseminate them, just so they'll continue to have an audience. One of the Cueballs tries to come to Snopes' defense, only to realize that the debunking was done by Snopes itself, creating a circular, invalid argument.  The title text suggests that MythBusters, another group that debunks myths, also participate in the practice of spreading misinformation for the opportunity to test it. Indeed, the show has occasionally been accused of spending undue attention on unnecessary filler ""myths"" just for the sake of filling out the season.  Snopes is also mentioned in the much later comic 1081: Argument Victory, in a much more positive light.","Cueball: Another urban legend? You should check out Snopes before sending me this stuff. Friend: Oops; yeah. Cueball: Man, Snopes is really great--independent fact-checkers trawling our collective discourse, filtering out misinformation. Friend: Yeah, but they have their dark side. The couple that runs snopes.com also runs a network of spam servers that start many of those forwarded stories in the first place, ensuring they'll always have business. Cueball: That's absurd.

256: Online Communities,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/256:_Online_Communities,computers,"I'm waiting for the day when, if you tell someone 'I'm from the internet', instead of laughing they just ask 'oh, what part?'","Note: This comic dates from Spring 2007. The internet changed a lot since that time. This is Randall's first map of online communities, with a successor (showing some zoomed-in highlights of the map) at 802: Online Communities 2. As Randall says on the map, the area of each ""country"" is roughly proportional to its membership, at least in 2007. Geographic location means a bit more, however, as the Compass-Rose-Shaped Island points out. North-south corresponds to a spectrum from practical to intellectual, and east-west corresponds to one from web-focused to real-life-focused. The map also bears a slight resemblance to South East Asia. Randall likes to draw maps in a manner like this. Each ""country"" is represented by size and related points of interest. We also have a ""Sea of Memes"" and a small ""Straits of WEB 2.0."" [edit]Compass Rose-shaped Island This is a joke located near the middle of the map, that nonetheless serves to organize the illustration. A Compass Rose —the name for the multi-pointed star that shows where North is on the map— appears on most maps; however, here, it's actually land that just coincidentally looks like a compass rose. The ""points"" of the island do, however, roughly organize the map. Left is ""Focus on Real Life,"" labelled ""IRL,"" an abbreviation for ""In Real Life."" Right is ""Focus on Web,"" labelled "".com."" Up is ""Practicals,"" labelled ""N,"" as in ""North,"" but with small letters making it spell ""Noob,"" slang for a ""Newbie"" or ""New user"" — a person less experienced with the internet, as many of the sites to the top of the map are ones infamous for having large numbers of largely computer-illiterate people. Down is ""Intellectuals,"" labelled ""π,"" an important constant in mathematics approximately equal to 3.14. [edit]The Icy North These are ommunities that were once major players, but now in a much reduced role. While some are still fairly large, they're somewhat relics of older times, hence the ""Mountains of Web 1.0"" that run through them — Web 1.0 is the first major generation of websites. Yahoo! was the most popular search engine around 1998, but lost out to Google. It remains in business due to diversification (it now owns Tumblr, for instance). Windows Live, particularly Windows Live Messenger, used to be a particularly major way for friends to communicate, now taken over by Skype and the like. Once a more-or-less ubiquitous branding, now used much less. https://home.live.com/ ‎is one remnant. AOL was once a huge player in the internet service provider market, noted for sending out millions of floppy disks and CD-ROMs in the 1980s and '90s offering a month or so free internet service (followed by high fees and difficult cancellation). Notably, AOL was the first company to sign up large numbers of people to internet access throughout the year, whereas before then internet was mainly provided by colleges and universities, fundamentally changing internet culture (see Eternal September). This influx of new users or ""Noobs"" (short for ""newbies"") names the Noob Sea south of AOL. The Chat Rooms nearby were a selling feature of early ISPs — ways to communicate with other people from that ISP. They are largely dying now, but were a major selling point in the early days. Classmates.com and Reunion.com are early sites that offered to help you find your former classmates from school, a role largely taken over by the big, more generalized social media sites. Classmates.com is probably best known by its memetic advertisement that said ""She married him??!! And they've got 7 kids??"" Friendster was the first big social media site. It was later outpaced by Myspace and Facebook (see Social Media below). It has survived by rebranding itself as a social gaming site, now used primarily in Southeast Asia. Qwghlm: A reference to The Baroque Cycle, a series of science fiction books by Neal Stephenson. In them, Qwghlm is a group of islands in the icy north. See http://baroquecycle.wikia.com/wiki/Qwghlm. Chasm: A barely-readable note just below the ""O"" of ""NORTH."" This may simply be a reference to a lot of fantasy series containing a chasm. (For example, the One Ring is destroyed by flinging it into a fiery chasm in The Lord of the Rings.) [edit]Dating sites (Northwest coastal regions) E-Harmony and OkCupid are dating sites; the other, larger sites near them are mostly social media sites. The Lonely Island label appears to be a joke: Surrounded by, but separate from dating sites and social media sites, it would be a rather lonely place. Possibly named after ""Tol Eressëa"" (Translation: The Lonely Island), a somewhat obscure location in J. R. R. Tolkien's books, but there are other possibilities. [edit]Social Media (West) These are sites mainly used to communicate with friends, such as Facebook and Myspace. The first large one was Friendster, but this has largely become a social gaming site primarily used in Southeast Asia, as discussed in The Icy North, above. Other social media sites listed are: Faceparty: A UK social media site started in 1999. Myspace: A social media site partially owned by, of all people, Justin Timberlake. Started in 2003, and peaking around the time this comic was made, it nonetheless still remains popular for bands (hence ""Myspace Bands"" in the southwest). It was never known for having a particularly attractive web design (partly because users could extensively customize the look and feel of their profile pages), hence only a very small part of it labelled ""Attractive Myspace Pages."" The Series of Tubes: A reference to an internet meme. In 2006, U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, while arguing for the end of ""Network neutrality,"" a concept that keeps ISPs from favouring or charging more for high-speed access to sites, claimed that such regulation was needed because the Internet was ""not a truck"" you could just load up with as much as you want, but a ""series of tubes."" This was fairly accurate, but his arguments were poor and badly phrased, and his speech subsequently received widespread derision (originally from Jon Stewart's The Daily Show), and it became a running gag on the internet. Facebook: Generally considered (at least in the West) the ""modern"" social media network, and the most popular. However, this comic is from 2007, and Facebook did not catch up to Myspace until 2008-2009. [Source: Myspace] Orkut: A social media network launched in 2004 by Google, it became hugely popular in Brazil, India, and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Xanga: A blogging and social media site launched in 1998. LJ: LiveJournal, a blogging site, more or less, but one that allows an internet forum-like structure where anyone, or selected people, can all start new posts on a community. Noted for a large number of teenagers, fanfic authors, and the like in its heyday, hence the ""Bay of Angst"" to its south. Blurty: LiveJournal's software is Open Access, meaning anyone can use it to set up a site. Blurty is, according to Wikipedia, an 18+ general community using this software. Cyworld: A South Korean social media site featuring avatars and ""mini-rooms."" [edit]The Blogipelago (Southwest) This is a portmanteau of blog and archipelago. Sulawesi is a real island in the Indonesian archipelago, implying that this region's similarity to Indonesia is probably intentional. Huffington Post: The Huffington Post is a web-only news site, named after its founder, Arianna Huffington. It's noted for attracting notable people to do very good write-ups of politics and news, generally with a liberal slant, but also for having a medicine section that supports every sort of quackery and nonsense, including a regular column by Dana Ullman promoting homeopathy (see 765: Dilution). Shipwreck of the SS Howard Dean: In the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, Howard Dean raised funds mainly over the internet, and was doing very well, until a gaffe caused him to crash and burn just before the primaries began. See Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004. Cory Doctrow's Balloon: Reference to 239: Blagofaire. Boing Boing: An occasional trend is for a smallish magazine to get a website, have the website become vastly more popular than its print edition, and become a successful website. Examples include Cracked.com, The Onion, and the subject of this label, Boing Boing. Boing Boing is a group blog covering technology, intellectual property, science fiction, and futurism. Technorati: A site for searching blogs. Sulawesi: As mentioned above, a real island that is part of the Indonesian archipelago. Xu Jinglei: A Chinese actress. According to Wikipedia: ""In mid-2006, her Chinese-language blog had the most incoming links of any blog in any language on the Internet, according to Technorati."" PostSecret: A website that people send postcards to, describing their secrets. Some are little secrets (like swigging milk directly from the jug or carton), some are old, deep-seated traumas, and some are just things that they could never admit to anyone publicly. Worth a look. The Wet Sea: Perhaps a reference to a West Sea, but not sure what that would be. Maybe just a simple joke, as what else would a sea be but wet? TWB or TMZ: A very-hard-to-read label, south of Technorati. TWB is short for ""Translators Without Borders,"" a charitable project that tries to translate necessary texts into the languages of the people who need them for free. This might be it, if it's meant to relate to Wikipedia, to the east of it. On the other hand, TMZ is a major celebrity gossip blog, rated #15 in the ""World's 50 most powerful blogs"" by The Guardian, and, at time of writing, rating #11 in the Technorati top 100. [edit]Sea of Culture (Central region) Sites for sharing and showing off music and images, most focusing on self-created content. Gulf of YouTube: YouTube is the definitive video website where people can upload videos with the purpose of public viewing, ranging from home movies through official music videos through Let's Plays of people playing video games to questionably-legal uploads of cartoons and films. Google has since purchased YouTube. Piczo: Teen-oriented website that allowed one to make a profile and put up pictures. The site has been dead since late 2012, due to the rise of Facebook. See Piczo. Broadcaster: Another dead site, almost lost to the web. Only a few scraps of information remain on the web. One of the rare scraps of remaining information indicates that it was a webcam broadcasting service that also allowed YouTube-like sharing of videos. The Bit Torrent and the P2P Shoals: Reference to file sharing (passing around often copyright-infringing files, such as movies, CDs, and the like), often done with the BitTorrent protocol. A ""Torrent"" can also be a flood of water, hence it being used to name a river. ""P2P"" stands for ""Peer-to-peer"", the basis for the BitTorrent protocol. Flickr: a website where people can upload and share photographs they took. LastFM: a music website that is notable of its ""scrobbling"" feature. DeviantArt: the largest art website, where people can upload, sell, and buy not only art itself, but also video, audio, Flash-work, and even skins (the original purpose of deviantArt). While many big-name/professional people and organizations have their works in deviantArt, the site is more infamous for the large amount of people who upload low-quality fan-art and fan-characters, most notably of media from Japan. Another point of infamy is the large amount of drama that can happen in the website. Straits of Web 2.0: A strait is a narrow passage between two outcroppings. Web 2.0 is a term used to describe new internet architectures, which these programs and Wikipedia (the other side of the strait) are examples of. Gays of Web 2.0 is a pun: The opposite of a gay person (homosexual) is a straight person (heterosexual). [edit]User-created content and discussions (Southeast) Sites such as Wikipedia and chat programs such as IRC. Wikipedia: The world's largest encyclopedia, collaboratively edited by its users. It's labelled as ""The Wikipedia Project"" (actually called Wikimedia), since Wikipedia has generalised to cover a number of separate web sites, though, at the time of this comic, none near the size of Wikipedia (excepting, possibly, Wikimedia Commons, which is partly an image repository for Wikipedia), perhaps explaining the small size of all the other vertexes of the ""web."" Usenet: The predecessor of most modern forums. A set of discussion groups that dominated the early internet. It also predates the standard web architecture to some extent — there's no standard weblink for it, for instance. See Usenet. IRC isles: IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, a simple, low-bandwidth program for chatting. Common uses include Dungeons and Dragons games and other geeky pursuits. SourceForge: A code repository. Basically, a place for programmers to meet up and work together on a variety of free and open source projects. See sourceforge. Has become less respectable since this comic was created in 2007, due to allowing misleading advertisements intended to trick people into installing questionable software. MIT: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the most respected universities for Engineering, Robotics, and other such fields. Engadget: A blog/online magazine, in multiple languages, reviewing tech products and commenting on technology news. Gizmodo: A blog about technology and design. MakeBlog: A blog highlighting bizarre and interesting do-it-yourself projects, often with a geeky theme. Google's Volcano Fortress: A volcano fortress is one traditional dwelling place of evil geniuses in fiction, and Google has quietly taken over huge chunks of people's interaction with the web. Perhaps this provides some background for 254: Comic Fragment? Stallman's Airship: A joke, perhaps in line with Cory Doctorow's Balloon (239: Blagofaire, also referenced in this strip) [edit]Ocean of Subculture and Sea of Memes (East) Need descriptions Sites related to smaller internet communities, a.k.a. ""Subcultures."" Also, a whole lot of internet memes, unsurprisingly. The ""Viral Straits"" references the idea of something ""going viral,"" i.e. spreading quickly to huge numbers of people on the internet. These sites are often responsible for things going viral, and the memes listed are ones that went viral in the past. Sites 2Channel: a Japanese imageboard that was actually the original inspiration for... 4Chan: an imageboard in which people can upload pictures, while others comment on them. The website is infamous for its loose/often non-existent rules, incredibly vulgar userbase, source of new memes, and spawning of trolls. 4chan's random board, known internally as /b/, is almost constantly flooded with porn and image macros. The fact that 4chan is a very small island on this map (to the far right on the map - left of ""dragons"" in the sentence Here there be anthropomorphic dragons) made quite a fuss for Randall. And this caused the comic to be mentioned in FRUIT OPINIONS! on the Blag. Although this comic was one of the more controversial, it had nothing on the impact of 388: Fuck Grapefruit, which was the cause of the Blag entry as that became the most controversial comic written to that point (i.e. 2008): ...beating out comics about cunnilingus, the Obama endorsement, and my making 4chan tiny on the map of the internet. (See the grapefruit comic for more details). Reddit: the self-described ""front page of the Internet"" in which users submit stories, photos, and videos, and the best are ""up-voted"" to the top of the page. Digg: a former competitor to Reddit in the social-news sphere, but has been sold since this map was drawn and restarted as an aggregator of news stories. Fark: A website that writes humorous commentary on various news reports, especially the strange, bizarre, or things from the political far-left and far-right. Something Awful: a website that is meant to showcase all things ""awful."" SomethingAwful also has a large trollbase, but they tend to be more honorable than the ones from Encyclopedia Dramatica and 4chan. One example is there being a spotty holding of the no-furries rule in the forums. The forums themselves are famous because of the holding of the ""Let's Plays"" of Dangan Ronpa and Super Dangan Ronpa 2, which had cooked up public interest to the point of there being an English-language release of the games. /.: Slashdot, a news site for technology-related news stories, which are submitted by its users. The ""Slashdot effect"" is named after this site. YTMND: a community in which users can create meme-type nonsense by playing music over an image (either static or animated). Its name is an acronym for ""You're The Man Now, Dog!"" Stumble Upon: A website that attempts to develop a profile for users in order to recommend which websites they might enjoy. Del.icio.us: Another image and website aggregator, linking to various things of interest. It uses tags to let people find specific types of content. (Note: Since this comic, this website was renamed as ""Delicious."") Memes and related Isle of Slash: ""Slash fiction"" is a type of fanfiction that takes two male characters from another work of fiction and puts them in a plot where they have lots of sex with each other. Named because of a common way of writing pairings in fanfiction, ""X/Y"", with the / being pronounced ""slash."" Adding to this, ""Isle of"" sounds like ""I love."" Numa: A reference to the viral video ""Numa Numa,"" consisting of a man dancing and lip-syncing to the song ""Dragostea din tei"" (Romanian for ""Love from the lindens""). Your Base: A reference to the ""All your base are belong to us"" meme, a line from the game Zero Wing, a game with a huge amount of hilariously badly translated Engrish dialogue. See 286: All Your Base for more discussion of the meme. Bay of Trolls: Trolls are people who attempt to stir up controversy by intentionally saying statements meant to annoy others into responding. ""Bay"" can refer to both a sheltered port and to an animal's cry, so ""Bay of Trolls"" can be read as ""Shelter for Trolls"" or ""Angry Shouting of Trolls."" Given the communities surrounding it, both would make sense. Soviet Russia: ""In Soviet Russia"" jokes are a style of joke commonly associated with -comedian Yakov Smirnoff, which has since become an internet meme. Example: ""In America, you always find a party. In Russia, Party will always find you."" — playing off of the idea that ""Party"" can also refer to the Communist Party. The meme version usually isn't as clever as that, though. See ""in soviet russia."" SPAAARTA: As in, ""THIS! IS! SPAAARTA!!!"", a famously over-the-top line from the movie 300. [edit]MMORPGs and related games (Northeast by East) An area dedicated to MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games), large-scale games with huge numbers of players put into the same world. The label ""Here there be anthromorphic dragons"" references a common marking on old maps (""Here there be dragons"") but updates it to joke about the more humanoid dragons seen in many games, or again, how dragons, especilally anthropomorphic dragons, are very-very popular in the furry community. Yahoo Games: A branch of Yahoo (see ""The Icy North"") dedicated to games (mainly boardgames). UO: Ultima Online, one of the first MMORPGs, and the first to grow to any size. Based on the long-running Ultima RPG computer games. Started 1997. EQ: EverQuest, another important early MMORPG, started 1999. UO and EQ have declined significantly since then; for a while, they were each the iconic MMORPG, but that role has been taken over by... WoW: World of Warcraft, an MMORPG launched in 2004, again based on a previously-existing RPG series, and by far the largest and most iconic at the time of this comic's creation. A few others have attempted to challenge it since. Runescape: Free-to-play fantasy MMORPG; the largest in existence. FFXI: Final Fantasy XI, the eleventh installment in the Final Fantasy series of video games, and the first to be a MMORPG. It didn't really take off until after this comic was made. Lineage: 1998 MMORPG. Particularly popular in South Korea, a country with somewhat of a cultural obsession with video games. Second Life: A virtual world, noted for largely working from user-generated content, which can be sold by users for real money. See Second Life. Third Life is a joke based on Second Life — if it existed, it would presumably be a game people play to escape Second Life, which they play to escape their first, real life.","[Hand-drawn fantasy style map with land and sea areas representing populations of online communities.

262: IN UR REALITY,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/262:_IN_UR_REALITY,computers,"Hey, at least I ran out of staples.","The LOLcat meme genre involves pictures of cats in various poses and facial contortions accompanied by deliberately misspelled captions. Black Hat claims to be from the Internet and is thus creating LOLcat memes by literally gluing captions to Cueball's cats.  The title text suggests that Black Hat is using glue only because he ran out of staples; fortunately for the cats in the picture, glue is much less painful than a staple. The title is also a reference to the ""I'm in ur base killing ur d00dz"" catchphrase from real-time-strategy games and The Staple Madness.",[Black Hat is holding a cat and a piece of paper. Cueball has raised his arms. There are three cats with captions stuck to them.] Black Hat: Oh hi; I'm here from the Internet. Cueball: What are you doing!? Black Hat: Gluing captions to your cats. Cat: rrrr
274: With Apologies to The Who,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/274:_With_Apologies_to_The_Who,computers,"Trivia: Roger Daltry originally wrote ""Don't try an' Digg what we all say"" but erased the second ""g"" when he moved to reddit.","This comic refers to the song ""My Generation"" by the British rock band The Who, which was released in 1965. The song is about intergenerational conflict and has been regarded as a very decided proclamation of youthful rebellion. Cueball adapts the lyrics to describe his own generation, the Millennials. As people born from the 1980s onwards grew up with the internet, this generation is also nicknamed ""digital natives."" It is therefore natural that the updated lyrics should refer to blogging and internet slang. The actions performed by Cueball while typing the text relate to the original music video, in which The Who smash their instruments in true rock star fashion. Cueball wails his keyboard like a guitar and smashes his monitor in the end.  The title text jokingly suggests that the band's lead singer Roger Daltrey originally meant the line  as a reference to the social news site Digg, but changed it after switching to its competitor Reddit.  The song was actually written by guitarist Pete Townshend  ""Daltrey"" is mis-spelled.  An explanation of the terms in this comic:  The original lyrics of the song run as follows:","[Cueball is sitting at a desk with a computer, typing.] Monitor: People try to shut us d-d-down  just 'cause our music gets around [Cueball is standing on his chair and typing with his keyboard across his hip.] Monitor: Old folks act like total noobs get off our net; you block the tubes [Cueball is really wailing on the keyboard.] Monitor: Why don't you all just d-d-disconnect and don't try an' grok our d-d-dialect [Cueball smashes the keyboard into the monitor.] Monitor: I'm not tryin' to cause a big s-s-sensation  I'm just bloggin' 'bout my generation"
286: All Your Base,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/286:_All_Your_Base,computers,The AYB retro-return-date (Zero Wing Zero Hour) should be around AD 2021.,"The comic refers to a popular internet phenomenon (meme) called ""all your base are belong to us"". This catchphrase originates from the arcade shooter ""Zero Wing"" and is a popular example of a poor translation into the English language. The phrase was popularised throughout the Internet and referenced in various images and videos. It is considered one of the earliest Internet memes, with the first occurrences dating back to the year 1998.  Cueball has, according to the comic, participated in the spread of the meme during its heyday. Ponytail wonders at his keeping the content he created years ago, as the meme's popularity has massively decreased since then. Cueball answers that this was always his favourite meme, and that he is waiting for the day it gets revived. His second to last line, ""What you say!!"" is a line from the game as well, although he says it much sooner than its supposed return to popularity.  By using the example of internet memes, the comic also relates to the general principle of fashion that everything once popular will, after a long enough time, be again in vogue. Trends experiencing this renaissance are often referred to as retro. Internet phenomenon can be observed to follow the same rule, although with much shorter intervals due to the speed of information turnover.  The title text prophesies the return of the ""all your base"" meme in 2021 (similar-sounding to ""AD 2101,"" the date mentioned at the beginning of the game). It also contains a pun on the term ""zero hour"" and the name of the game which initially brought the phrase into fashion.","[A section of a Linux terminal window is shown.] Text from window:  [Ponytail is at computer.] Ponytail: What's with the All Your Base stuff? Didn't that die like five years ago? [From off-panel]: Yes.  [Cueball enters panel.] Cueball: It was my first internet meme, and my favorite. Others tired of it, but I never did. Cueball: So I wait.  [Cueball raises his fists.] Cueball: Someday, decades from now, people will have forgotten. It will be fresh again. Cueball: Retro. Cueball: And when that day comes,  Cueball: I WILL BE READY! Ponytail: You need a hobby or something. Cueball: What you say!! Cueball: Wait, too soon."
352: Far Away,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/352:_Far_Away,computers,Sometimes an impulsive 2:00 AM cross-country trip is the only solution.,"Cueball and Megan are in a long-distance relationship; in order to overcome the distance which separates them, they're keeping in touch with an instant messenger. Because their contact is limited to text, they have to write out the actions they wish to enact. Cueball is frustrated with the limitations of these place-holding phrases and longs for physical contact, going so far as to imagine himself hugging Megan in the messenger window.  In the title text, Cueball suggests that, sometimes, the only way to end his frustration is to travel across the country and see her face-to-face.","[Cueball hugging Megan in the messenger window.] Cueball: Meh. Cueball: Some nights, typing ""*hug*"" just doesn't cut it."
386: Duty Calls,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/386:_Duty_Calls,computers,What do you want me to do? LEAVE? Then they'll keep being wrong!,"Cueball, and many Internet nerds, feel an irrepressible urge to correct people on the Internet, and often get intensely invested in arguments over mundane or insignificant topics. In this comic, Cueball is presented as an exaggerated example of one such arguer.  His statement that ""This is important"" shows his excessive investment in whatever [unnamed] topic he is arguing about.  Additionally, Cueball's interpretation of the argument as ""someone is wrong, I need to correct them"" rather than ""someone disagrees with me, I should learn from them"" parodies internet arguers' insistence in the obvious, objective superiority of their viewpoint.  The title text reinforce this satire.  The phrase ""Duty Calls"" used in the title is traditionally used in much more dramatic contexts [say, by a police officer, firefighter, doctor, etc. when talking about their job], so applying it to the job of arguing on the internet is a humorous mismatch that puts Cueball's disproportionate investment into perspective. Cueball's exasperated, all-or-nothing retort ""What do you want me to do? LEAVE?"" in the alt text further highlights the absurd nature of his emotional investment in this argument.  His reasoning that ""they'll keep being wrong!"" if he leaves suggests that the only solution he sees is to continue to argue until everyone on the internet has agreed with him on all issues–a ridiculously impossible plan.  By taking this satire to its logical conclusion–an eternity of arguing on the internet with no time for pleasure in real life–Randall reminds the reader that getting emotionally involved in internet arguments at the expense of real life is a terrible, terrible idea.  In 955: Neutrinos another incarnation of Cueball is cured of a similar disease. A much later comic is simply called 1731: Wrong, but here it is not the other people who are wrong!",[Cueball is behind a computer.] Voice outside frame: Are you coming to bed? Cueball: I can't. This is important. Voice: What? Cueball: Someone is WRONG on the internet.
438: Internet Argument,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/438:_Internet_Argument,computers,It's easier to be an asshole to words than to people.,"Since the first time the internet made possible to have sustained conversations with people in remote locations, it was found that most people tend to use harsh language in these conversations much more often than they would with regular spoken face-to-face conversations. This effect is similar to what happens when people drive a car: they're much more likely to get exasperated or angry at other drivers than they would when not driving.  Also, some people collectivelly known as Trolls find it funny to disrupt other people's conversations in internet forums, posing as innocent speakers. Examples of this can be entering a conversation between cancer patients suggesting the use of some ""miracle"" cure, or just asking simple, obvious questions and then pretending to not understand the answers. Most probably, trolls wouldn't have this behavior if they were speaking to a group of people in real life. A similar concept is Wikiterrorism, where someone intentionally includes false information in Wikipedia to see how long it lasts before someone notices.  In the first two panels, Cueball is  having some harsh words and probably insults with another troll. Megan takes hold of Cueball and flies him to the other one, so they see each other face to face. In this situation, they both remain silent as none of them find anything to say to the other.  When Megan returns Cueball to his original computer, both keep their conversation, but without the insults.  The title text just summarizes the whole idea into a single sentence.",[Cueball is typing profanities into his computer.] [Friend is typing profanities into his computer.] [Megan floats in behind Cueball.] [Megan lifts Cueball.] [They are flying over mountains.] [Megan and Cueball are floating in front of the friend and his computer.] [She sets Cueball down in front of the friend and his computer.] [Megan lifts Cueball again.] [They are flying.] [Megan sets Cueball down in his chair at his computer.] [Cueball is typing at his computer.] [Friend is typing at his computer.]

The one-minute preview, unofficially nicknamed ""2 Girls 1 Cup,"" is a viral video that became a well-known internet meme. It is therefore not surprising that only the input combination of x=2 and y=1 generates a significant number of search results, being 257 times as frequent as the runner-up, ""1 Girl 1 Cup.""  The cells in the table with zero hits are white. From 1 to 9 they are yellow, and above that they are orange - except the maximum, which is red. As the second largest count is below 10,000 (7503) and the maximum almost two million, it is impossible to say if the red color is reserved for the maximum or for any number above a given value, say from ten thousand or up to above a million hits.  The title text suggests other combinations like 1 girl to 10,000 cups (very large number of cups to one girl), 2 girls to (5+3i) cups (a complex number), 65536 girls to 65536 cups (216, the first integer that can't be represented as a two-byte unsigned integer), and finally 3 French hens and 2 turtle doves to 1 cup. All are phrases with apparently no search results.   The last phrase is a reference to the song The Twelve Days of Christmas. After the publication of this comic, the phrase has been cross-posted at various sites in order to generate search results and prove the statement in the title text wrong. The same has happened to other entries, as often happens shortly after Randall posts something regarding Google searches.","Google results for ""<x> cups <y> girls"" [There is a table with eight columns and eight rows.

Since this comic was released in October 2008 and the presidential election was in November, it was then unknown which of the candidates would become president by the time the comic was set (Spring 2009). This is why the president in the comic is out-of-panel and therefore not revealed to us. As it would turn out, the president inaugurated in January 2009 was Barack Obama, who has gone on to demonstrate a tactical use of the Internet (including the more frivolous aspects of it) for public relations purposes. The suppositional president in the comic is less savvy.  The tubes being clogged is a reference to the, now deceased, Alaska Senator Ted Stevens who, during a congressional debate on net neutrality described the Internet as a series of tubes (be sure to listen to the audio clips in that Wikipedia page, and you'll see why he became a big hit with the Internet). Ted Stevens also gained notoriety for backing a proposal to build a bridge to nowhere using federal funds. The question ""What are they a-Twitter about now?"" refers to the website Twitter, which is a microblogging and social networking site.  Cats are notorious for being hard to herd, thus the idiom ""herding cats"" meaning an extremely difficult task that can very quickly get away from anyone undertaking it. Lolcats are pictures of cats, usually in humorous poses, that have insipid captions on them. The conflation of lolcats and the herding idiom escaped the president (who is presumably somebody not familiar with the former term). The title text refers to Ceiling Cat, a lolcat parody of God.  As with cats, Bloggers are an ideologically diverse bunch, and are hard to get to go in a single direction.  The proposed ""Secretary of the Internet"" would likely be a new position on the President's Cabinet, which currently consists of the heads of 15 executive departments and are, with the one exception of the Attorney General (who heads the Department of Justice), titled ""Secretary of Department"".  All comics in the Secretary series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  It is possible that this series is a continuation of 493: Actuarial, in which Black Hat demonstrates great power over even Internet trolls via his sociopathic ways. This would explain why Black Hat was chosen as Internet secretary.","Spring 2009— The new president faces a crisis... [Cueball is talking to an unseen Mr. President, who is sitting behind a desk.] Cueball: Mr. President, the bloggers are restless. Mr. President: What are they a-twitter about now?  Cueball: It's the tubes sir. They're clogged. We put too much stuff on them.  Mr. President: How bad is it? Cueball: The internet could be inoperative within days.  Cueball: We can't let a crucial resource go unshepherded. Mr. President: Go on.  Cueball: I recommend you appoint a Secretary of the internet. Someone to impose some orders on this mess.  Mr. President: Ordering bloggers around? Doesn't sound easy. Cueball: No; it's like herding lolcats. Mr. President: What? Cueball: Nothing.  Mr. President: Do you have someone in mind for the post? Cueball: I know just the guy.  Soon: Phone: Ring [Black Hat looks away from his computer at the ringing phone.]"
495: Secretary: Part 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/495:_Secretary:_Part_2,computers,That helmet won't save him.,"Whenever something big happens the news media likes to have at least two things: interviews with people that are the news, and on-the-scene reporters. In this case Blondie as a news anchor is shown to begin with talking about Black Hat and she has even been out at his house. Even if those reporters are simply standing in front of a building that something happened in, they have to be on-scene. To thwart the media (and probably everyone else), Black Hat has built a moat around his apartment building. The second reporter is on-the-scene from the Internet, or rather, one of its darkest corners: 4chan. In more detail, 4chan is a collection of image boards, which act somewhat like forums, where users go to share images. The different boards are named by their ""folder"" structure, for lack of a better term. Therefore, the name /b/ comes from its URL: 4chan.org/b/. Pronounced ""slash bee"" (because the second forward slash is not necessary), /b/ is the ""random"" board, where anything goes, where anything is the superset of all sets, as in anything. Absolutely. Anything. As in, going more than two seconds without seeing pornographic content or hateful slurs is almost unheard of. /b/ is also the one that gets the most publicity, because it has started most of the memes [1] on the Internet, as well as the birthplace of Anonymous. The chaotic nature of the forums explains why the title text suggests that the reporter isn't safe, even though he is wearing a helmet. In fact, a goofy helmet like that is liable to get the trolls on him faster than if he didn't have it.  Ron Paul is a man who is currently a U.S. Representative for Texas. At the time the comic was published, he was running, for the second time, for President of the United States.  A haberdasher is a person who sells small articles of clothing that have been or can be sewed. In modern English a haberdashery (where a haberdasher would work) is a place that sells hats.  Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign did, in fact, use a blimp which was named the Ron Paul Blimp. However, despite their elegant appearance, blimps are not a very fast way to travel.  The images on the board behind the reporter are: The Fonz, /b/, a CD, and Epic Fail Guy, spelling out ABCDEFG.  The title text states that the second reporter (Tom)'s helmet won't help him, though from what, it is unclear as he himself stated he wasn't sure why he was wearing the helmet.  All comics in the Secretary series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  It is possible that this series is a continuation of 493: Actuarial, in which Black Hat demonstrates great power over even Internet trolls via his sociopathic ways. This would explain why Black Hat was chosen as Internet secretary.","[Blondie as a news anchor sitting behind a desk is reading from a paper she holds in her hands.

512: Alternate Currency,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/512:_Alternate_Currency,computers,"For the first time ever, the phrase 'I'd like to thank everyone at 4chan for making me successful and happy' is uttered.","Cueball is shown watching television, where it is announced that the US dollar has collapsed and been replaced by an 'alternative currency' of humorous pictures commonly shared on the internet. Such a currency would be utterly useless; for untraceable and easily counterfeited .gif and .jpeg files to become more monetarily stable than the US dollar would mean that the economy is all kinds of screwed, to the point of utter absurdity.  The title text pokes fun at users of 4Chan who are notoriously known for their habit of hoarding image macros, a practice he suggests is almost useless except in the instance jokingly suggested by the comic. 4Chan is also reputable for reducing the Happiness and Success of many people their community targets anonymously.  Randall also pokes fun at himself in saying ""I have been preparing for this moment my whole life"", indirectly implying he is also guilty of this practice.  The ""rare pepe"" meme that has recently sprouted on 4chan implies that some photoshopped pictures of Pepe the frog are valuable and that they could be sold. 120 Rare pepe's reached a price of $99,166 on eBay before being removed. [citation needed]","Television: With the collapse of the dollar, the government has endorsed an alternative currency. Your monetary worth is now determined by the number of funny pictures saved to your hard drive.  Caption reads: I have been preparing for this moment my whole life."
553: Pirate Bay,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/553:_Pirate_Bay,computers,We find you guilty of closing your torrents as soon as they finish. Your sentence is unremovable Hungarian subtitles on everything.,"The Pirate Bay is an Internet website dedicated to facilitating Bittorrent downloads of popular media. The site's servers were taken down, briefly, and the operators were taken to court in Sweden, back in 2009.  Unlike normal downloads, files downloaded via Bittorrent are not stored on any web server, but instead transferred in small pieces by other people torrenting the same file; these other people are called ""peers."" Bittorrent allows websites to provide downloads without using up disk space or bandwidth serving up the entire file; instead, they can host smaller torrent files, which simply describe what the finished file should look like and a few ""tracker"" servers where lists of other peers can be found, and the peers themselves handle all of the bandwidth issues. This approach is used by a number of websites for completely legal downloads (it's popular among smaller game companies providing digital downloads, for instance), but it's mainly associated with piracy.  However, Bittorrent depends on peers actually having the file blocks that you need. People who have already downloaded the entire file, but continue to connect to the network solely to provide that file to others, are called ""seeds,"" and they are an essential part of a healthy torrent. General etiquette demands that people should continue to seed a file until the ratio of data uploaded to data downloaded exceeds 1, although many people feel that one's ratio should be much higher. In any case, closing your torrents as soon as they finish, as mentioned in the title-text, is extremely bad etiquette, so it is punished with nuisance subtitles. This punishment was likely chosen because finding correct and well timed subtitles, in whatever language, for a pirated show tends to be quite hard sometimes.  This comic is essentially a pun on this second meaning of the word ""peer"" - in the US court system, a ""jury of your peers"" means a jury composed of everyday people like you, while the Pirate Bay operators interpret it to mean a jury composed of people who they've shared files with in the past. The Cueball that does the talking, and thus is the prodigy of the comic, feels that his approach would give him lenience in the trial, since he has always seeded well, thus ensured those peers had a good downloading experience.  The title text shows what punishment this kind of peer group would make if they find you guilty - unremovable subtitles in Hungarian. Many pirated videos originate from countries where no dubbed version is available in the regional language, so the only way to understand what's being said is by applying subtitles. These videos are then uploaded with subtitles still included, causing consternation among downloaders who can understand the spoken words but not the subtitles. Annoying Hungarian subtitles are just an example for a language most people don't understand. Finnish, Czech, or Polish wouldn't be better.","[Caption above the frame:] Awaiting the judges' ruling at the Pirate Bay trial.  [4 Cueball-like guys in a cell: 3 sitting down on a bench and one is standing, presumably looking at the fence.] Cueball: I wish this were in America. Cueball-like guy: Why? Cueball: I hear we'd go before a jury of our peers, and I've always seeded generously."
573: Parental Trolling,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/573:_Parental_Trolling,computers,They'll pick music and culture that they know annoys you. Building in behavioral easter eggs is a fair retaliation!,"Set in the future, a daughter approaches her father playing a music video of Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"". The daughter insults her father's generation's versions of playing pranks, specifically Rickrolling. The daughter refers to this as ""trolling"" (part of the comics title), which is popular jargon for trying to disrupt a person or community via an action to elicit an emotional response. The humour is in that the dad reveals he has 'trolled' his daughter by creation a reaction in which her speech centres would shut down when she gets upset, thus eliciting an emotional response which perfectly displays his prank. This would not be possible in real life unless he messed with her brain which would be dangerous and illegal.[citation needed]  In this comic, the girl holds an ultra-thin tablet, a futuristic technology when released, a year before the release of the iPad. It also shows a curved computer monitor and keyboard, which seem to float above the desk.  The title text refers to the conflict between teenagers and adults over music and culture, with teenagers often listening to music which annoys their parents. 'Easter egg' is a term used to describe a hidden inside joke or feature inside software. Here, the daughter has been treated like a piece of software by her father Cueball. He states that since the kids on purpose chooses music and culture that they know annoys their parents, it is a fair retaliation to build in such Easter egg responses. Many people would probably disagree on this, but maybe not so much parents with teenagers at home...  ""Teehee"" could also be a reference to NigaHiga's YouTube channel.","[In a frame crossing the top border of the first panel of the comic:] The future  [Cueball is sitting at a futuristic desktop computer with the curved screen and keyboard both floating above the table, and a girl with pigtails is standing behind him with a portable ultra-thin screen.

591: Troll Slayer,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/591:_Troll_Slayer,computers,We have met the enemy and he is us.,"Stephenie Meyer is the author of the Twilight novels, a series of vampire novels popular with young teens. It is a love it or hate it type of novel, with a large following and a large portion of haters as well.  In the comic, 4chan, an imageboard, is featured. Imageboards such as 4chan have the feature to post anonymously. The users of 4chan launch an attack on a Twilight board and Stephenie Meyer asks them to stop. When they refuse, Meyer writes 4chan into her next novel, thereby drawing in a large number of fans of her novel as a counter-attack to what 4chan ran on the Twilight forum. This results in what the original 4chan users consider a ruined imageboard (not that this plan would have any chance of success in the real 4chan, but there's the joke as presented).  The title of the comic is drawn from the internet slang term troll, which refers to actively attempting to get a rise out of a forum. In this instance, 4chan attempted to troll a Twilight board and Meyer acted against the troll, making her a ""slayer"" of them. Obviously the pimpled boy she chats with is very dismayed by this result, as there are now so many more vampire-book-fans than computer geeks on 4chan, and they cannot get through with any of their funny/evil plans anymore. There may also be a reference to the famous vampire slayer known as Buffy, seeing that Stephenie's main character vampires do not need to be slain, but she then turns on those who tries to do so in real life on the message board.  The pictures used on the two panels showing the 4chan imageboard tells a lot about their users. It is unclear what the text page refers to. And also what it is that Cueball is standing next to. But a black hat, as shown in the third picture is typical for an internet troll (see the xkcd version of Black Hat), and also the guy saying LOL is already laughing out loud at you before you read his text. He also LOL's in his comment about the angsty teens that reads the books, and whom he looks forward to trolling.  In the second 4chan panel all four images relate to Twilight. The first picture most likely depicts Edward Cullen and Bella Swan (from the movies) standing with their backs against each other. This person enjoys being anonymous. The second picture with the text Dawnz refers, in ""plural"" form, to the last book Breaking Dawn which was split into two films part 1 and part 2. This person wish to know about peoples favorite vampire, exactly the kind of questions the trolls would have mocked on the Twilight board, now infesting their own site. The third picture is of a person (man/woman?) who have tried to dress up like a goth vampire, even commenting on the darkness of the picture. The last picture depicts the cover of the last book Breaking Dawn with the two chess pieces. This fan seems to be searching for a date around Dallas...  The title text refers to Walt Kelly's famous saying. Kelly used it to refer to all of mankind, whereas here it refers to the users of 4chan, by bringing on the enemy of their forum themselves.","[A list of post comments alongside pictures on a website. The first picture shows a page from a book/website with a small black picture with a white feature in the upper left corner and text to the right and below it.

The third picture shows a man with a black hat holding up a sword to the left and a trumpet to the right. The fourth and last picture is cut off in the middle at the bottom of the frame.

Across the top border of the frame is a smaller frame with a caption:] Hours Later:  Stephenie Meyer (typing): Hi, it's Stephenie Meyer. Fine, you don't like my books. But please leave us alone.

621: Superlative,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/621:_Superlative,computers,"Stay while I recount the crazy TF2 kill I managed yesterday, my friends.","The comic parodies a famous advertisement campaign for the Dos Equis beer brand. In the campaign, Jonathan Goldsmith plays ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"", a suave elderly gentleman with a number of astonishing life experiences and skills. The campaign's format generally includes the narrator presenting hyperbolic descriptions of the man's accomplishments, followed by the man delivering his signature catchphrase, ""I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis."", which has been widely adopted as an internet meme.  Cueball plays the antithesis of the protagonist in the campaign: the least interesting man in the world. Unlike the stories in the advertisement, his affairs tend to bore the listeners. Being the generic everyman, he possesses no outstanding capabilities at all. While the original is said to ""speak French... in Russian"", Cueball seems to have forgotten his French altogether. He also has apparently nothing of interest to tell, either in real life or in his blog. Instead, he will talk away about his weird dreams and his success in video games. Moreover, he is unable to stand too much beer and therefore absolutely ill-qualified to advertise it.  The title text is a reference to the slogan of the campaign ""Stay thirsty, my friends."" It also references Team Fortress 2 (TF2), a multi-platform, multi-player First-person shooter game.","He has dreams. [Cueball is gesturing to Megan.] Cueball: I was in this weird cross between work and my old house... Which he'll tell you all about. He can speak French. Or could in high school, anyway. A little.

624: Branding,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/624:_Branding,computers,"Actually, 'RSS&M' is kinda catchy.","This comic pokes fun at web sites (adult-themed sites in particular) which try to inflate their popularity by comparing themselves to other popular online services.  The strip shows four such advertisements that appear to Cueball as he browses the Internet.  Adblock is a browser extension which prevents advertisements from being displayed. Presumably Cueball normally browses the Internet with Adblock enabled, and thus would not see any of these ads.  The first advertises a website that brands itself as the ""Facebook of sex"". Because Facebook is ubiquitous, this is probably a good branding idea. Facebook is known to most users and connotes an easy-to-use platform where it's very easy to find people, chat with them, share pictures, etc. For someone looking for sex, this would probably seem like a good site to use. There are, in fact, sites that use this branding in their advertisements and/or their user interface which is likely what inspired Randall to write this comic. Cueball sighs and moves on, probably having seen this kind of ad many times already.  The second brands itself as ""Twitter for 18+ singles"". It is a similar but seemingly invented ad which again plays on the ubiquity and popularity of Twitter. Twitter being a (generally) public chat forum which limits posts to 140 characters is still popular enough to get some attention and make someone think about going to the site.  Sending messages to the world in 140 characters or less might be somewhat less of a versatile platform than Facebook for chatting with other singles, but still perhaps viable. Cueball notes that it is becoming more and more popular to brand adult sites by comparing them to popular non-adult sites.  This third takes a turn for the unusual, branding itself as ""Google Reader for S&M"". Google Reader is a now-defunct platform that allows users to aggregate web feeds such as RSS feeds into one place for convenience. The service is notably less well-known and popular than Facebook or Twitter, and given that it doesn't directly link you with other people, doesn't have the same connotation of allowing you to connect with others. Perhaps it would be a site that allowed you to aggregate various fan fictions, blogs, or other written works relating to S&M. However, Cueball is surprised such a site would exist.  The final ad brands itself as a ""GitHub for lesbians"". GitHub is a website that allows developers to collaborate on software projects using the Git revision control system. The concept is absurd — GitHub has a specialized function unrelated to anyone's gender or orientation, and it's barely a social network at all; the usefulness or appeal of such a system made specific to lesbians is not apparent. Cueball is surprised and possibly even intrigued by this last ad.  The title text relates to the third panel.  RSS is a technology involved in Google Reader. RSS&M is a portmanteau of RSS and S&M.  This is a possible way for the third web site to brand itself.","Browsing without adblock [Cueball is sitting at a computer.] [Pop-up window with red background.] The Facebook of SEX! Click now!

Please be at the UN tomorrow at 8:00 sharp.,"This comic re-imagines a scene from Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, this is shown in the first two panels depicting the siblings Locke and Demosthenes, as Cueball and the girl. Their real names are Peter and Valentine Wiggin (and these first names are used in the official transcript on xkcd). In the book these two kids write their opinions on their world's version of the internet to gain extreme political influence. Below is a synopsis:  Spoiler alert!  In the book Ender is an above-average-intelligence boy who is selected to become a potential leader of Earth's ""Defense"" Forces in the event of another Bugger invasion (later re-titled the Formic invasions). Meanwhile, Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine decide to save the world from itself. They do this by asserting themselves as wise demagogues who comment on political events on what are known as the ""free nets"" which are nets open to comment by anyone in the world. They choose pseudonyms to write under, as no one would take the words of children seriously, choosing Locke (Peter's pseudonym), and Demosthenes (Valentine's) and begin work. Eventually they gain enough respect to be invited to participate in moderated political debates in the higher class nets. By the end of the book, Peter has become the leader of the world, and Valentine runs away with Ender to a planet formerly inhabited by Buggers to live out their lives in peace. End spoiler alert!  Ender's Game was published in 1985, when most people had never used (and some had never heard of) the internet. The first webpage set up with individual personal opinions (leaving out forums and bulletin board services) was online in 1994, the word ""weblog"" was invented in 1997 and ""blog"" in 1999. When Orson Scott Card wrote Ender's Game, Peter and Valentine's plan was based on a sci-fi idea expected to occur in the near future.  However, this apparently science-fictional future concept is now just the mundane (and extremely un-influential) act of blogging. In 1985, Orson Scott Card's idea of how politics works in practice may have seemed a little naive, but now that blogging is an everyday phenomenon, Peter and Valentine's aspirations seem downright silly. We see their plan to win vast political influence manifest itself as a WordPress blog, and a particularly unimportant one at that, with 0 comments on most posts.  The joke hinges on the underwhelming reversal of Peter and Valentine's expectations. It forms both a parody of science fiction that has been rendered outdated by technology, and also a parody of the expectations well-intentioned people have going onto the internet to express their opinions.  The titles of Peter's blog posts parody the arrogance of internet commentators, with names beginning with things like ""Everyone's wrong about..."" This further underscores the lack of influence his WordPress blog would have and his naivete, as this is a typically unconvincing way to speak to people about politics, but someone with the arrogance to think everyone will naturally see their genius and insist they be put in charge of the world would not realise it.  In the bottom right corner there are links to other blogs. One is for Demosthenes, but the other is for FiveThirtyEight, a real political blog that was fou nded by Nate Silver in 2008, more than a year before this comic was released. It was still owned by Nate in 2009, the year of this comic's release, but in 2010 the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and in July 2013, ESPN announced that it would become the owner. The blog takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college: 538. It is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging. Nate Silver has been referenced, several times in xkcd, though mainly in the title text, before this comic for instance in 500: Election.  The title text uses Locke's full name, Peter Wiggin, and is formed as a short letter that informs him that he has become the president of the world, and that he should meet tomorrow 8:00 sharp at the united nations (UN) headquarters. This is a very child-like representation of how a presidential appointment might be announced, further riffing on the naivete of the plan in the first place.   Also note that the note is addressed to ""Peter"" rather than ""Locke""; Peter's attempt to remain anonymous has failed miserably. The title text says that Peter got the presidential post because he received enough up votes on his reddit comments!  During their conversation, Peter is shown feeding a squirrel. In Ender's Game the character of Peter Wiggin is a sadistic sociopath - and there is a particular scene in the book where Valentine stumbles across a skinned squirrel still twitching in pain.  References to both Ender's Game and Squirrels are frequently recurring tropes in xkcd.","[The ""real"" names and the fact that the squirrel is vomiting comes from the official transcript on xkcd.]  [Valentine (a.k.a. Demosthenes, with long dark hair), is laying on her back on the ground looking up at the sky with her hands behind her head. Peter (a.k.a. Locke, looking like Cueball) is attracting a squirrel with some food his hand.] Valentine: Ender's up there saving the world, but down here it's falling apart politically. What can we do?  [Peter turns towards and sits down, leaning back on one hand. Valentine sits up in a similar position. Her hair looks like a mix between Megan and Hairbun's hair. The squirrel behind Peter is bending over the food Peter has thrown out for it.] Peter: I know — we get on the nets and anonymously post political opinions. People reading our articles will see our intelligence, recognize how clear and logical our arguments are, and insist that we be put in charge, so we can fix everything! Valentine: Brilliant!  [Beneath the first two panel is large panel displaying a blog page. The background is light gray and then there are four white rectangular sections with rounded corners.] [There is a heading in the top central section:] Locke Powered by Wordpress  [Below is the largest section, which extends below the panel. It has a scroll bar to the right which is partly scrolled down. The last sentence of a post can be seen at the top, with a time stamp below.

713: GeoIP,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/713:_GeoIP,computers,"Meet hot young singles in your mom's basement today'? Man, screw you, GeoIP.","GeoIP is a service that converts IP addresses to their respective location on the Earth. This is done by looking up the IP address in a database maintained by various internet service providers. Advertisers often take advantage of the Joneses effect by creating localized ads which misleadingly appear to be specific to your location, but are often simply stock photographs with the name of the nearest town superimposed on top.  The comic satirizes this phenomenon. The International Space Station (ISS) has a high speed data downlink, but no direct connection to the internet. But here, Cueball trolls the advertisers from on board the ISS, by inserting his actual location on low Earth orbit into the database under that IP address. He proudly present his result to Ponytail where the advertisements claim that there are ""local girls"" in low Earth orbit; a distance of roughly 420 kilometers above the Earth surface, and thus at least that far away from all other girls in the world if they are not on the space station.   The title text shows GeoIP has become so accurate that it can now pinpoint the user's location to his Mom's basement. In United States, an adult living with his/her parents is termed shameful for that person, since it means that the adult does not have a job and cannot support himself. The ads are typically of the form -- ""Meet hot young singles in <user's location>"" where the <user's location> part is filled in from GeoIP. In this case, the GeoIP is so accurate that it not just identifies that user is in his parents' house, but it also pinpoints the location that he's hiding in the basement, perhaps because he does not want to be seen by people visiting his parents. Thus GeoIP is unknowingly shaming the user by reminding him that he is in his mom's basement, and hence the ""Screw you"" response.","[External view of a the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting the blue Earth below, shown with white clouds as stripes below and black sky above. Dialog, written in white on the black sky, comes from within the ISS.] Cueball (inside the ISS): Yes! Ponytail (inside the ISS): What?

[Internal view of the satellite, Cueball and Ponytail are floating weightlessly around, Cueball is at a laptop style computer mounted to the wall.

741: Blogging,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/741:_Blogging,computers,I'm looking to virally monetize your eyeballs by selling them for transplants.,"This comic is a satire of the conflict between consumers who expect quality results and creators who just want to make easy money by pandering to their audience. Cueball says the key to making a successful blog is to build a relationship with your readers. While this may be a good way to ensure you are delivering content that is relevant to your audience, if a blogger keeps the audience's interests as the foremost priority, the blog may become focused on making their core audience happy rather than quality. When an audience member raises the concern that quality should be a paramount concern if you want to impress people, Cueball responds that content (the quality of the blog's content) will be addressed later in the speech. This quickly placates the audience member, illustrating how the audience (for example, readers) of a service can be easily satisfied by telling them what they want to hear. This validates Cueball's point that the audience does not want quality as much as they want to hear their own ideas repeated back to them.  Alternative explanation: This comic is a shot at all the typical blogging and social media instruction that is given. Cueball indicates he believes great content is not the highest priority when writing a blog, relegating it to at least part three of the coverage. The person in the audience, who is representing the ""normal people"", shows that people actually go to blogs for good content and couldn't care less about the other ""strategies"" the person on the stage is talking about. ""Awesome! I love content,"" is probably highly sarcastic, implying that Cueball's talk is rather devoid of it. It could imply that the speaker thinks this talk is mostly marketing jargon that misses the fundamental aspects of writing skills (style, personality, good ideas, research, basics of style) and focusing instead on schemes to artificially gain popularity.  The title text takes a jab at blogs concerned with ""viral content"" and ""monetization"". That is, bloggers are only concerned about their audience because they might potentially give them money. Cueball drops some marketing jargon — ""monetize the reader's eyeballs"" — in order to disguise his true purpose: illegal organ harvesting.","[Cueball stands on a stage before a large audience, holding a pointer and using it to highlight something on a screen behind him. He interacts with a member of the audience after making a point.] Cueball: The key to making a successful blog is building a relationship with your readers. Audience Member: I thought it was ""make your updates good so people will want to read them."" Cueball: We'll discuss content generation in part three. Audience Member: Awesome! I LOVE content."
773: University Website,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/773:_University_Website,computers,"People go to the website because they can't wait for the next alumni magazine, right? What do you mean, you want a campus map? One of our students made one as a CS class project back in '01! You can click to zoom and everything!","This comic uses a Venn diagram to point out that there is often a significant disparity between what a university displays on the front page of its website and what users — particularly prospective students — are primarily interested in finding there.  This is often because those who are making the university website instinctively believe, from their perspective, that the website should contain things that the university is proud of, or that they personally find useful, so they are unable to look at it from the perspective of a person who is new on campus and simply wants to know what number to call for campus security. Thus, simple details like contact information and university data are often overlooked.  The title text presents a satirical response from the school defending their site design, consisting mostly of PR worthy of an alumni magazine (a publication that is seldom anticipated so eagerly). It also uses sarcasm to make fun of university websites that have wildly out of date site design (web technology was relatively primitive in 2001) and a CS (Computer Science) student built it instead of a professional.","[A venn diagram.] [The left circle is labeled ""Things on the front page of a university website"" and contains:] ""campus photo slideshow"" ""alumni in the news"" ""promotions for campus events"" ""press releases"" ""statement of the school's philosophy"" ""letter from the president"" ""virtual tour""  [The right circle is labeled ""Things people go to the site looking for"" and contains:] ""list of faculty phone numbers and emails"" ""campus address"" ""application forms"" ""academic calendar"" ""campus police phone number"" ""department course lists"" ""parking information"" ""usable campus map""  [The only item in the overlapping section is:] ""full name of school"""
802: Online Communities 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/802:_Online_Communities_2,computers,"Best trivia I learned while working on this: 'Man, Farmville is so huge! Do you realize it's the second-biggest browser-based social-networking-centered farming game in the WORLD?' Then you wait for the listener to do a double-take.","This comic shows a map of internet communities where the size of each region roughly corresponds to its size, and its proximity to other regions indicates similarities. This is the successor of 256: Online Communities. It differs in that it is updated, and furthermore, instead of using the membership of whichever service to determine its size on the map, it uses its ""daily social activity."" The map actually has two super−maps intended to show the relative usage of types of communication: the online community map is surrounded by the much larger ""countries"" of E−Mail, SMS (""Instant Messaging"") and ""Cell Phones,"" which in turn are surrounded by the even huger ""Spoken Language."" It is unclear whether ""Cell Phones"" is intended to represent an independent region, or whether it is meant to be a sub-region of ""Spoken Language."" The ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that cell phones are the primary medium of SMS, and are also used to access email and online communities. It's also unclear why other forms of communication, such as handwritten letters, are not included. At the title text Randall explains that, using his definition of ""most activity per day,"" Farmville is actually the second most popular social-network farming game - the Chinese game Happy Farm was more popular at the time. This strikes many English-speaking xkcd readers as odd, because Farmville is much more famous, leading one to wonder how it could not be the most played. The phrase ""browser-based social-networking-centered farming game"" is an example of an overly-narrow superlative. [edit]Facebook Region The Facebook region deals with social networks, that is, websites oriented towards having people meet. Facebook is a social networking site that allows people to meet old real−life friends and make new friends that share similar interests. One of its most notable features is that a member can update a ""status"" or make normal posts about the happenings of the member's life, complete with pictures, other members ""liking"" these posts. The size of the Facebook region is not exaggerated; most websites seem to allow ""liking"" their content or allow/require logging in the website with a Facebook account. There even are cell phones with a ""Facebook"" button! FarmVille and Farm Town are Facebook games in which users manage farms. Happy Farm, the Chinese game that inspired the other two, does not require Facebook integration, so it is separated by a solid line from Facebook. The ""Unethical Bay"" refers to how these games tend to addict players into constantly buying virtual items of questionable value. People You Can't Unfriend refers to people whom, due to real-life expectations and relationships, unfriending them is difficult, no matter how you really feel about them. Blatherskite River refers to the conversations on Facebook, which may be long yet devoid of general meaning or logic. Data Mines refer to the data mining that Facebook does with the interests of its members. This fuels the profitable advertising business at the expense of customer trust. Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions refer to how interactions with family members on Facebook suddenly become more awkward because everyone on Facebook (and sometimes off Facebook, given that you do not necessarily need to log in if you want to see someone's Facebook account) if you are discussing with your family through post comments. 524,287 Strong for Mersenne Primes refers to the communities who gain followers for a cause. A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is 1 less than a power of 2; 524287 is the 7th known Mersenne prime. Jungle-Bay Mountains of ""It's Complicated"" refers to one of Facebook's options as to what a user's relationship status currently is. A Jungle-Bay Mountain is a complicated and undefined climate, hence the complication. ""lamebook bay"" refers to the online website ""lamebook"", where users post photos of funny things that happen on Facebook (these can include statuses, ""fails"", put-downs and images.) ""Old Facebook"" Resistance refers to Facebook's earlier users, who have often resisted (and resented) changes made to Facebook as it became more popular. Privacy Controls is located on the map surrounded by a Lava Pool, which is a reference to how difficult it is to find the privacy controls within Facebook. Niche Market Mountains refers to social networks aimed towards more niche markets are located. Similar to how mountains tend to be isolated from mainland, niche social networks tend to be just that: niche, without much interaction with the general populace. Charred Wasteland of Abandoned Social Networks refers to the tons of websites wanting to take advantage of the success of websites like Facebook to compete or even overpower with them. Even so, these websites tend to not have the userbase or even the expertise towards the long-term, hence they become wastelands: environments devoid of life, except the few life forms that are from these wastelands (in this case, the ones who are loyal to the website or which are sadly few). In the Charred Wasteland stands Ozymandias, the titular broken statue of Shelley's poem. In the poem, only ""two vast and trunkless legs of stone"" and a ""shattered visage"" are all that remain of the once-great statue and both of these features are present in the comic. According to the poem, the pedestal before the broken statue reads ""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings..."" hence ""friend of friends"" below Ozymandias on the map. In the north are the Duckface Mountains and the Red Cup Mountains.""Duckface"" refers to this incredibly obnoxious facial expression, and ""red cup pictures"" are any pictures containing party-goers holding disposable red plastic beverage cups. Facebook is absolutely flooded with both types of pictures. In the south is Buzzword Bay. Buzzwords are words and phrases that make you sound a lot more topical than you actually are, used to garner attention; again, Facebook status updates are commonly filled with buzzwords. While Facebook is the largest ""country"" of the Facebook Region, there are a lot of smaller ""countries"" that represent smaller social networks. Below Facebook (and ""Old Facebook' Resistance"") is Diaspora, a fully open-source, decentralized, privacy-respecting-and-expecting alternative to Facebook. From what this map tells, Diaspora is little-known, even if Facebook is taken out of the context. StudiVZ is a German-speaking social network similar if not a ripped-off version of Facebook. XING is a German-speaking social platform similar to LinkedIn. Ning is a service to create custom social websites. Its free services shut down in 2010. Taringa! is a Spanish-speaking social network that is based on a forums. Copyrighted material is frequently found there. Next to the Euro(pean) Gulf is Skyrock (social network site), a French-speaking social network. Wer-kennt-wen is a German-social network somewhat like MySpace. Nasza-klasa.pl or NK, is a Polish-speaking social network based on school relationships. Badoo is a social network primarily based on dating and picture-sharing. Classmates.com is a service in which the user can meet classmates that came from the same high school. The website is probably best known by its memetic advertisement that said ""She married him??!! And they've got 7 kids??"" (Incidentally, there is more to the coupled picture than what the advertisement says.) Myspace is a social networking website that is a kind of proto-Facebook: users could customize their one-page websites with whatever they wanted, make their interests and daily lives public, and interact with other users. Back in the mid 2000s, MySpace was the largest social network, many people using the website; however, the surprisingly-less-customizable Facebook ended up taking the place of MySpace. The ""bands"" country of MySpace refers to how a lot of bands in the day advertised and interacted using the website. Indeed, the latest incarnation of MySpace (in terms of 2013) is more oriented towards band members. LinkedIn is a social network aimed towards people in the workplace, which is why it is adjacent to Corporate Bay. Orkut was one of Google's first social networks before Google made Google+. It shut down in 2014. Hi5 is a social network that is very popular among people in Latin America. Renren (「人人」, ""people"" in Chinese) is ""a Chinese copy of Facebook."" Bebo was a social network popular in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It went bankrupt in 2013 and will move away from social networking and into apps. Friendster - One of the first major social networks, it has fallen way off in usage in recent years and was eclipsed by MySpace. It is still popular in Asia. Vkontakte or VK, is the second largest social network service in Europe after Facebook. It is available in several languages, but particularly popular among Russian-speaking users around the world. Netlog is a Belgian social networking website specifically targeted at the global youth demographic. Mixi is an online Japanese social networking service. Qzone is a social networking website, which is big in China. According to a report published by Tencent, possibly surpassing other social networking websites like Facebook and MySpace in China. Tuenti is a Spain-based, social networking service, that has been referred to as the ""Spanish Facebook."" Cloob is a Persian-language social networking website, mainly popular in Iran. After the locally (and internationally) popular social networking website Orkut was blocked by the Iranian government, a series of local sites and networks, including Cloob, emerged to fill the gap. Kaixin001 is a social networking website which ranks as the 13th most popular website in China and 67th overall. Piczo was a privately held blog website for teens. In November 2012, Piczo.com shut down. Odnoklassniki is a social network service for classmates and old friends. It is popular in Russia and former Soviet Republics. Adult FriendFinder is a pornographic dating site. Match.com is a dating site, mainly targeted at people looking for marriage. Ok Cupid is another dating site, however it has been owned by Match.com since 2011. PlentyofFish is yet another dating site, also owned by Match.com since June 2015. Sulawesi is a real-life island in the Indonesian archipelago. It also appears in 256: Online Communities. [edit]MMO Isle MMOs (short form of ""Massive Multiplayer Online Game"") are online games where multiple people take the role of a character and play in a setting hosted by the game. Habbo Hotel is a website where someone creates a human avatar an interacts in a virtual world that is not that different from the one in real life. Club Penguin is Disney's MMO where someone creates a penguin avatar and interacts with other in a more polar, cartoony setting. Club Penguin is aimed towards children. Maple Story is an MMO that has a more natural setting. The most distinguishing feature of Maple Story is its cartoony pixel art. GameFAQs, while not an MMO, is a website that has the largest repository of walkthoughs, that is, guides that help someone beat a game. GameFAQs is notable for not only its large repository of walkthroughs of games that are across an extreme variety of consoles, handhelds, and even computers (not all of them MMOs), but also the drama that is rumoured to happen in the GameFAQs forums. IGN (full: Imagine Games Network), while also not an MMO, is the largest website that gives news on video games in general, not just MMOs. Each of the games mentioned in the site have pages that have summaries, reviews, screenshots, other art, videos, and links to news related to its games. FFXI (full: Final Fantasy XI) is an MMO from SquareEnix, being the first MMO of the popular Final Fantasy series. Runescape is an older MMO. Starcraft II is a realtime strategy game with a science fiction setting that heavily involves space travel. While technically not an MMO, it has a significant online multiplayer component. WoW (full: World of Warcraft) is the definitive MMO, being not only the most popular and one of the longest-running but also the most expansive (having its own spinoff games, comic books, novels, and even figurines), WOW giving the idea of how an MMO should be. A player can choose from a variety of races, each with its own heavy history. Second Life is similar to Habbo, albeit with a bigger suspension of disbelief (one example being that the player does not need to be a human) and in a 3D setting. NationStates is a text-based political simulation game. Notably, some of its traffic comes not from the actual game (which is optional), but the extensive set of political, roleplaying, and general forums attached. Urban Dead describes itself as ""A Massively Multi-Player Web-Based Zombie Apocalypse"", which sums it up pretty well. KoL (full: Kingdom of Loathing) is a comedic browser-based MMO-ish RPG with minimalistic stick-figure art. CDC Games is a Chinese company reputed to be the largest MMORPG distributor. EVE Online is a science fiction MMO which is notable because of its virtual economy. Gaia or Gaia Online, while not an MMO, is a forum oriented towards pop culture, including video games and Japanese media. Its most notable feature is the heavy customization possible of a member's pixel-art avatar. Its members tend to roleplay a lot, albeit in a more written, story-based form. Gaia has gained a reputation with its members stealing art and causing drama. The ferry that links the gaia island with 4chan was most likely due to the ""boxxy"" row, where vlogger boxxy posted videos of her using gaia, which then were circulated on 4chan. This resulted in a division of the sites users, and many more hacking attacks, including a DDOS attack on 4chan itself. EverQuest (full: EverQuest) is one of the first MMO's, it's still running and has a huge number of expansions. UO (full: Ultima Online) along with EverQuest this was one of the first and longest running MMO's. CoH or City of Heroes was a superhero-based MMORPG that was shut down November 2012. Atlantica (full: Atlantica Online) is a turn-based MMORPG. Lineage is a Korean MMORPG, it's North American servers were closed 2011/06/29 due to being unprofitable. Lineage II is a Korean MMORPG, mainly played in Asia along with its predecessor. It adopted a Free to Play model on 2011/11/30. SubSpace was a 2D, topdown shooter released in 1997. The servers have been shut down, but it continues to operate through the work of fans. It's widely considered an early entry into the MMO genre due to its unprecedentedly high player count. Other notable regions include: The Mountains of Steam, referring to the game distribution service Steam where people can buy and download video games in general, not just MMOs. There is also an extensive community where users can share content, and instant messaging chat by text, voice, or game streaming. River Grind refers to ""grinding."" In most MMOs, the character is a fighter of some sorts, yet starts at a level 1, signifying the character's aptitude level in combat. The character can level up and gain more aptitude levels through earning experience, of which the most reliable and otherwise common way is the process of ""grinding,"" that is, repeatedly fighting opposing monsters (sometimes of a level notably lower that your character's), gaining experience points from winning these battles until your character gains a level, that is, ""levels up"". While a practical necessity in strengthening the character, this process can be tiresome, hence the expression ""grinding."" Spawn Camp refers to ""spawn points"", the places where AI-powered enemies and players who have died in-game respawn, and the act of ""spawn camping"", in which the player character simply stands behind or around the spawn points to fight the enemy creatures or respawning players as soon as they appear. Gulf of Lag refers to how the MMO can be slowed down a considerable amount due to the large amount of players simultaneously using the same server, this congestion bogging down the server and frustrating the users. End Guy for the Internet refers to ""end bosses,"" the last — and usually hardest to defeat — ""bad guy"" in a game (or a section of a game). [edit]YouTube Region The YouTube region refers to websites that are based on user-created content. YouTube is the definitive video website where people can upload videos with the purpose of public viewing, ranging from home movies through official music videos through Let's Plays of people playing video games to questionably-legal uploads of cartoons and films. Google had purchased YouTube. Many of the sites on the map are just references to viral videos at YouTube: Viral Shores refers to how viral videos (whether they be viral marketing or simply memes) tend to proliferate on YouTube. Britney likely refers to pop singer Britney Spears and the ""Leave Britney Alone"" guy. Maru Gulf refers to Maru the Cat, a YouTube celebrity also mentioned in xkcd. Prairie Dog Habitat likely refers to the viral video Dramatic Chipmunk (which is actually a Prairie Dog). Rick Rolling Hills references, well, Rickrolling. More information here. The ""deserted"" note likely refers to how Rick Astley himself is tired of the meme, or again, how people tend to leave the video upon getting ""Rick Roll'd,"" never actually going to the video with the express purpose of viewing the video. Lunar Landing Soundstage is, of course, a reference to the Moon landing conspiracy theories, which Randall has railed on before. OK Go Bay refers to the band ""OK Go"" who have multiple viral music videos on YouTube, most famously ""Here it goes again"" featuring treadmills. The HTML5 swamp refers to YouTube's spotty support of HTML 5 (an update on HTML that is frequently touting its media capabilities, making HTML 5 a viable alternative to Flash). Of course, by the time the comic was written, HTML 5 was still in its infancy. The Music Video Bay refers to the amount of music videos (official or otherwise) are present in YouTube. Other counties of the YouTube region include: vimeo, a website where people tend to showcase artistic content that they made on their own, notably independent studios. Snob Sound: Flickr, a website where people can upload and share photographs they took. Fotolog, a photo website very popular in South America in 2004-2008, which was used as a social network. Last.fm, a music website that is notable of its ""scrobbling"" feature. deviantArt, the largest art website, where people can upload, sell, and buy not only art itself, but also video, audio, Flash-work, and even skins (the original purpose of deviantArt). While many big-name/professional people and organizations have their works in deviantArt, the site is more infamous for the large amount of people who upload low-quality fan-art and fan-characters, most notably of media from Japan. Another point of infamy is the large amount of drama that can happen in the website. Newgrounds, a website that hosts art, (Flash-based) videos, audio, and (Flash-based) games to which other users can comment and rate. Even so, content from Newgrounds tends to be obscene, though there is a filtering system if a viewer does not wish to see obscene content. Chatroulette is a website where people are randomly paired up with each other and video/text chat. Brickshelf is the online resource for LEGO fans. Tumblr, where people could make a blog and post text, pictures, video, audio, quotes, and links. The most distinguishing feature is the ability to ""reblog"" these posts from other's people's blogs into the user's own blog. Notable features of Tumblr include sketchblogs (where people upload their sketches), Ask blogs (where people answer questions other users ask, the moderators of these blogs usually pretending to be a character from a form of media), and the large amount of ""social justice"" (a highly controversial political movement). (See also 1043: Ablogalypse.) b3ta is a popular British website, described as a ""puerile digital arts community"" by The Guardian. The Isle of teenagers who just discovered macroeconomics is a joke about how teenagers tend to think that the world and the economy are a lot simpler than they actually are. Combined with the typical internet mindset, this leads to a lot of teenagers posting blogs and videos and comments on blogs and videos describing how idiotic the government and other red-tape-related adults are. The Snob Sound could refer to the large amount of people who look down on others in the surrounding websites (one example being an original artist looking down on people who draw mainly fan-art). The Iraq is a reference to Miss Teen USA 2007, in which Ms. Teen South Carolina, Lauren Katlin, said ""I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like such as...the US should help the US and should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we are able to build up our future."" The usage of ""the Iraq"" has became a meme. [edit]Twitter Region Bieber Bay is a reference to Justin Bieber, a pop singer whose singing sprouted on YouTube and became very popular on Twitter and other social media. He is very much vilified because of his rather feminine appearance and his hordes of fans (called ""Beliebers"") that seem to support him to ridiculous extents. Lately, though, Justin Beiber has taken a ""bad boy"" attitude because of all the Beliebers who are willing to defend him no matter what, him partaking in a lot of questionable activities that include tattoos, questionably-legal substances, and buying prostitution, thus lowering his popularity in the general populace.

Waves is a pun on the fact that so many people used the word ""Breaking"" at the beginning of tweets that do not warrant that tag that the word has lost most of its meaning and become a joke. It is a pun because waves ""break"" on the shore. Web 3.0 refers to the unofficial term Web 2.0. In this case, ""Web 1.0"" refers to websites that give information to users. Web 2.0 refers to websites where the users themselves create content. Web 3.0 has sometimes been used as a term for semantic web, a machine-readable version of the web, but this usage is far from universal. Hashtag games whose popularity confuses and depresses you refers to the game where a user posts something under a particular hashtag and others respond with their own ideas, all tagged under the same phrase. This has been very popular for no clear reason, as Randall notes. [edit]Geotagged Bay Yelp is a website where people post reviews of real-life public locations (one example being restaurants).

[edit]Skype Region The Skype Region refers to different IM, or Instant Messaging services, that enable almost-real-time text chatting between multiple people. These often allow services like voice chat and even video calls. Skype is, according to Randall, the most popular of these among the internet. It has many features to allow peer-to-peer voice chats, as well as allowing calls to be made at a price to actual phones. AIM or AOL Instant Messenger is a chat client created by AOL.

Since it is still in use by some, it gets the tag ""Still Around!"" on the map. IRC Isles refers to the ancestor of Internet-powered chatting. People would have connected to a server and spoke publicly. IRC is still in use (as of 2014), notably in getting help from other users. One of those isles is #xkcd which is an IRC community around xkcd.

Photo Blogs are commonly used to chronicle the lives of the authors through photographs. Diary Blogs are another popular use of blogs (and, in fact, the original use) where authors write commentary about their lives. Bay of Grammar Pedantry deals with the fact that, whether due to a lack of proper education, a habit of using ""chat-speak"" in the text-limited SMS and MMS, or simply due to the (generally) more relaxed nature of the Internet, blog authors tend to write with horrible composition, a point of annoyment to a lot of other people due to the subsequent increased difficulty of reading the horribly-written material. Fandom Blogs are blogs created by a ""fandom"" which is a community of fans. A fandom blog deals with the subject matter of the respective fandom.

There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.  A peninsula on the south-west, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the south-east of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the south-west part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.  The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.  In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmville and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.  To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.  East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)  To the southwest of Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well.

This meant some comparing of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.  Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leaf reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).

834: Wikileaks,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/834:_Wikileaks,computers,STUDENTS ARE CALLING PRESIDENT JOHNSON EN MASSE TO PROTEST THE BOMBING AND IT'S JAMMED THE WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD. COULD THEY COLLAPSE OUR CRITICAL PHONE SYSTEMS? HAS THE FIRST TELEPHONE WAR BEGUN? STAY TUNED FOR MORE ON THIS DANGEROUS NEW TECHNOLOGY.,"This comic references WikiLeaks, a site to which classified data can be sent for publication, while nobody would know who leaked the data.  Many people dislike WikiLeaks, but proponents claim that, since government is supposed to work for the people, all government information should be available to anyone who wants to see it. WikiLeaks' actions are illegal in most countries, and the people maintaining WikiLeaks stay anonymous, with the notable exception of Julian Assange, the spokesperson. Among the supporters of Wikileaks are the 4chan-based activism/hacker group Anonymous, who, for the week or so prior to this comic's release, used DDoS attacks to take down servers for companies that aided the governments of the world in taking down Wikileaks and its CEO, Julian Assange. Amazon, PayPal and MasterCard were all targets of Anonymous. The claim 'We are legion' is a reference to Mark chapter 5 in the Bible, in which Jesus throws out a group of demons that call themselves Legion, ""for we are many.""  The comic imagines an ironic scenario in which WikiLeaks, the organization Anonymous fought to protect, stays true to their mission of releasing secrets to the public, and publishes the personal information of Anonymous members. The joke in the comic notes a contradiction in Anonymous's position, relying on strict secrecy of its members' private information while supporting an anti-secrecy organization like WikiLeaks. This may be a reference to an incident in 2009 when WikiLeaks published a leaked list of some of their anonymous donors, following their then-policy of complete impartiality regarding leaks.  In theory, Anonymous consists of everyone who takes steps to remain anonymous, not merely the hackers and criminals. In practice, Julian would merely have to post a list of Wikileaks contributors.  The title text appears to be a news wire from during the Vietnam War when Lyndon B. Johnson was President in the United States. The students were calling to protest the War, in what xkcd implicates as the first DDoS attack. A DDoS attack is a Distributed Denial of Service attack, one of Anonymous' favorite tactics, in which the attackers send vast quantities of traffic from many different points to take down a web server, or, in the case of the title text, a phone network. Taken as a whole, the title text satirizes news reports in which a DDoS attack is confused with an actual hack, as only in the latter does the attacker gain (partial) access to the system itself.","[A black formal suit with no head is talking.] Suit: We are Anonymous. We are legion. We are no one and everyone. And we are here to fight for WikiLeaks.

837: Coupon Code,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/837:_Coupon_Code,computers,This also guarantees he won't be one of the ones to get a bobcat.,"Some online stores allow you to enter a coupon code for a discount on one of their products. Coupon codes may be a single, simple word or a complex sequence of characters. In this comic, Cueball enters a long and detailed blackmail message in the normally short coupon code form, hoping that blackmail could serve the way a coupon code would.  This works so well that Cueball is discounted the full price of the product he's buying. The humor comes from the fact that Cueball's intimidation works as if the online seller was an actual person, and not a computer.    The title text references 325: A-Minus-Minus; it has become a running gag that bobcats are occasionally sent by mail by Black Hat in various comics.","[The panel shows an online shopping form.] Shipping: $14.08 Total: $80.02 If you have a coupon code, enter it here: [An empty form.] Check out  Cueball is looking at his computer.

855: 1999,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/855:_1999,computers,"Whoa, twenty-two in two hours!' 'Your site got twenty-two hundred hits in two hours?' 'No. Twenty-two. But still, that's like half the people on the internet!'","This comic is a parody of the movie The Social Network, a movie about the founding of the popular social network site Facebook. Here, scenes from the movie are reimagined to feature Zombo.com instead. Zombo.com, also known as Zombocom, is a website that was created in 1999 and using only Flash animations. Randall, like many others more, doesn't like this technique at all. The animation consists of a circle of quickly pulsating dots and a friendly deep male voice repeatedly welcoming the visitor to ""Zombocom"" and explaining that there was no limit to what could be done at the site, or rather, no limit except yourself. The message repeats while, ironically, there is absolutely nothing that can be done at the site until the message completes, at which point a link saying ""Sign up for our newZletter"" appears, linking to a page saying that the selected option is not available yet. If the link is not clicked, the Flash player will reset. Thus, you can still do nothing on the site.  The humor of the parody comes in substituting Facebook, a useful and popular website, for Zombo.com, a novelty site which gained attention for its complete uselessness.  Turn on your speakers and check zombo.com for yourself.  The last four panels are all direct parodies of specific scenes from The Social Network. The second panel is a takeoff of the scene where Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg comes up with the idea for the site, saying that people like checking up on their friends and acquaintances, so why not build a site that lets them do that? Because Zombo.com has no actual function, in this version the founder can't specify what he wants the site to do.  The third panel is taken from a scene where Zuckerberg is seen intensely focused on his work programming the site, his headphones insulating him from the outside world. His assistant describes his state as ""wired in"" and demands that he not be disturbed. In the comic, as Zombo.com is a very simple site which does not need much coding, the assistant offers the possibility that the founder is stoned as a reason for his focus. Indeed, it's one of the few conceivable reasons that one would be this focused on such a boring and pointless website.  The fourth panel is taken from a scene where co-founder Eduardo Saverin tries to push for monetization of Facebook, while investor and consultant Sean Parker argues against. The actual dialogue is ""You don't even know what the thing is yet. How big it can get, how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool? A billion dollars."" Here, instead of a billion dollars, the Parker character argues ""Circles,"" playing off Zombo.com's un-lucrative nature and the silliness of the design.   The final panel is taken from a scene where Parker advises Zuckerberg to change the name of the site from TheFacebook to just Facebook, calling it ""cleaner."" Here, he advises to change the name of Zombo.com to just Zombocom. Why the website is pronounced ""Zombocom"" rather than the more expected Zombo Dot Com is a mystery known only to its creators; perhaps, like in the movie, they also considered it cleaner.  The title text is a reference to a quote from the movie, specifically a conversation between Zuckerberg and Delpy (Zuckerberg is the first quote). In the actual film, Zuckerberg answers ""twenty-two thousand"" rather than just ""twenty-two"". This is a joke to the effect that, back in 1999, there weren't really that many people on the internet, and very few of them would have gone to Zombo.com","It's easy to forget, as we heap awards on The Social Network, That before there was Facebook, MySpace, or even Friendster... One website dreamed bigger than them all.  [Cueball and another are talking.] Cueball: People like doing stuff. So why not build a website that offers that? Another: Offers what? What would I do there? Cueball: Anything! The only limit is yourself!  [Another scene. Hacker, wearing headphones and oblivious, working at computer.

862: Let Go,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/862:_Let_Go,computers,"After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected.","It is human nature to lose interest in difficult or boring tasks, and instead do something easier, more interesting or more rewarding in the short term. While procrastination and distraction from more important tasks has always been present, this comic casts a light on the internet and the huge potential for distraction which it provides.   The first two frames in this comic are the set-up, and contain the websites CNN and Reddit and thoughts over the top of them. These types of websites are regularly updated with new content are prime candidates for distraction. The thought bubbles indicate that the reader is fully aware that they shouldn't be looking at these websites, but is unable to stop himself. Even the very rational thought that checking news stories more than once a day is bordering on pointless doesn't seem to stop him.  In the third frame, it starts to look a little different as the screen is not a computer but is in fact the targeting computer from Luke Skywalker's X-wing. At this point it becomes clear that there are far more important tasks at hand, namely flying the craft. Even then, Luke has an internal conflict and considers checking Facebook, but mentally checks himself, and to prevent himself from further compulsive browsing shuts down the system. The thought bubble at the bottom is one that is probably familiar to many people (especially students), where he realizes that he has to turn off the computer to actually concentrate on the important task.  In the fourth frame, we finally get the movie reference from Star Wars as Princess Leia and one of the Rebel Alliance's officers are gathered around the holographic table that allows them to follow the battle. In the movie, Luke turns off his targeting computer because he uses the force to fire the torpedoes at the right time. But in this comic, Luke turns off the computer because he keeps getting distracted by Reddit and CNN. When they ask whether he is alright, he responds in the way most people would who have nearly been caught wasting time on the internet. This is however a quote of what he actually replies in the movie.   See the Destruction of Death Star scene on YouTube. The Let Go remark from Obi-Wan Kenobi that had given the title to this comic occurs about two minutes into the clip. Though here it is a reference to let go of refreshing websites...  The headlines on CNN read 'Bees?', 'Where is Oman?', and 'iReport (we mean you, that is.)'.  The headline Bees? could be a reference to Cards Against Humanity. One of the white cards says exactly that. It could also just be a question to the picture above - if it was bees following the guy.  The headline Where is Oman? is below a map where land is white. It shows Cyprus, Northern Egypt and the Middle East with the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (seas are grey). Oman is not on this map as it is not situated on the Persian Gulf; it's on the Gulf of Oman and on the Arabian Sea, both of which can be considered parts of the Indian Ocean.  The title text is a serious solution to a procrastination problem that we see in the comic, later explained to take the form of simply rebooting the computer.",[Reddit page.] Luke (thinking): I shouldn't be looking at Reddit. Why can't I stop?  [CNN page.] Luke (thinking): Refreshing CNN again. Do news stories so affect my life that I benefit from checking them more than once a day?  [Shutdown screen.] Luke (thinking): I should at least check Faceb... no. Screw it. I can't do my job when I'm distracting myself every five minutes like this.  [Two people before a battlefield screen.] Cueball: His computer's off. Luke - You've switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Luke: Nothing. I'm all right.

Sharing the top with the internet libertarians are Nate Silver and several politically-active kite designers.,"The Nolan Chart is a visual representation of the political spectrum that measures not only liberal vs conservative tendencies but also libertarian and statist tendencies. In this comic, it is taken to a different end. One one side are both Democrats and Republicans and on the other side are baseball fans. In the typical Nolan Chart, Libertarians are in the top quadrant, but in this one ""Internet Libertarians"" take the spot because they love the Nolan Charts (which are found online) and have a lot of political opinions.  Nolan may also refer to baseball hall of famer Nolan Ryan.  In the title text, the NFPA-compliant chemical manufacturers are mentioned because of this diagram. Sir Charles Wheatstone was the inventor of the Wheatstone bridge, which is also diamond-shaped. The image text makes reference to Nate Silver, who previously worked for Baseball Prospectus and now writes a data-driven political and sports blog called Five Thirty Eight for ESPN. He is both a lover of diamond-shaped diagrams and has political opinions. Politically-active kite designers both would have strong political opinions (it comes with the territory of being politically active) and would love diamond-shaped diagrams, presumably because they would be interested in blueprints of kites.","[Diamond-shaped four-panel diagram with each panel labeled.

The title, ""Extended Mind"", refers to a theory proposed by philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers, which postulates that the mind not only includes what can be found in the skull, but also incorporates external things, like Wikipedia.  The title text refers to an observed phenomenon that many of Wikipedia's page links eventually lead to the Philosophy page. This may be due to the fact that the first few links in any article tend to reference more general or abstract ideas, which eventually gravitate towards philosophy. This is not actually true, though. It works for the spark plug page and countless others but not for all. The comment section below has some examples, but many of them are not working anymore, because Wikipedia references change in time.","[An IM window is open over a Chrome window with tabs for Spark Plug, Feeler Gauge, and Wikipedia.] Message with Mike1979 Mike1979: I replaced my spark plugs and now my car is running weird.

Took me a bit to realize I'd been tricked into setting up a daily exercise routine.,"Fitocracy is a web site that turns workouts into a social game by awarding points, badges, levels and all sorts of other gamification. Megan and Cueball, by their judgment, have spent approximately two hours engaged in sexual activity. However, according to this cartoon, Fitocracy does not consider sex to be an activity acceptable for its site, despite the vigorous nature of Cueball and Megan's sexual workout.  The title text explains how sites like Fitocracy are so successful. Because human brains, especially the cynical ones, like to game the system whenever they can, they will find easy things to do that also score high. In the case of Fitocracy, these are simple exercises that add up a lot when applied daily. But the creators of Fitocracy (and other such successful sites, like Weight Watchers or Lumosity) know this, and, as ""in Soviet Russia"", the system games you, as shown, to adopt an exercise regimen, or to lose weight, or to get smarter, or whatever else there is.  Sex does raise your breathing rate and heartbeat, but as sparkpeople (a similar site to fitocracy) notes, it is not as effective as a session at a gym, as it does not typically use the main muscle groups in their full range of motion and doesn't sustain a raised heartbeat for a sufficient length of time. They consider sex to be less effective as cardio than brisk walking, as it burns only about 100-200 kcal per hour, which is little raised above a typical resting rate of about 60 kcal per hour.","[Megan and Cueball have sex up against a wall.]  [Megan and Cueball have sex standing in an armchair.]  [Megan and Cueball have sex in a swing, swaying above a table with a flower vase on it.]  [Fitocracy.

979: Wisdom of the Ancients,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/979:_Wisdom_of_the_Ancients,computers,All long help threads should have a sticky globally-editable post at the top saying 'DEAR PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURE: Here's what we've figured out so far ...',"This comic refers to a common experience that those trying to solve tech problems have. Typically, people search on Google to try to find solutions to the problem. Sometimes the solution can be found on a software program's website, but the most helpful solutions frequently come from discussions on message boards, particularly for more obscure problems. This is because the odds are rather high that someone else, years ago, had the same problem you're having and resolved it.  However, in this comic, Cueball is unable to find any mention of the problem he's currently facing except for one forum post about it that did not include the problem's solution. This is akin to finding an FAQ with questions but no answers.  The title is a satirical reference to the notion that the ""ancients,"" i.e. from thousands of years ago, possessed knowledge that has been lost to the centuries (such as exactly how Stonehenge was built), and that artifacts from those times do not fully divulge such knowledge. The fact that the ""ancient"" referred to in the comic is from 2003 (only 8 years before the comic was published) is an exaggeration of the feeling that the forum poster is lost to the sands of time, but in some sense this feeling is nonetheless true, since Cueball is unlikely to be able to contact her or him.   The title text is a suggestion to forums to be aware of the fact that people are likely going to come across such posts in the future and therefore to provide handy summaries of the most helpful conclusions of long threads for them, since combing through several false starts and failed attempts to resolve a problem can be quite tedious.  In 1722: Debugging the title text also mentions googling an error message, explaining what it means if you get zero results.  http://www.mirrorsoferis.com/forum/thread05232003a.html","[A poem is written outside and right justified along the left edge of the panel to the right.]    Never have I felt so close to another soul   And yet so helplessly alone   As when I Google an error   And there's one result   A thread by someone with the same problem   And no answer   Last posted to in 2003  [Cueball stands in front of his desk, having risen so the chair has moved away behind him.

1031: s/keyboard/leopard/,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1031:_s/keyboard/leopard/,computers,Problem Exists Between Leopard And Chair,"Randall's browser looks like Google Chrome and he has installed at least four extensions on it, which explains the little symbols to the right of the address bar. Extensions are small programs that install into your Internet browser and change the Web pages as you view them. Some make pages easier to read, some remove ads (the third extension is AdBlock) and so on.   For the joke in this comic, an extension accidentally replaces the word ""keyboard"" with ""leopard"" in a regex (or regular expression). In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means to ""match"" (specify and recognize) patterns in text, such as particular characters or words. The command to substitute/replace a string is ""s"", e.g. ""s/old/new/"" replaces any occurrence of ""old"" with ""new"". The title therefore contains the command to change ""keyboard"" into ""leopard"".  It's not clear what the extension Randall installed was actually supposed to do, but most extensions that revolve around text replacement are humorous in nature (such as Cloud to Butt, which replaces all instances of ""the cloud"" with ""my butt"").  The title text references the common IT phrase ""Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair"" or PEBKAC, which means that the problem is caused by the user, not by any failure of the computer.  There has been several comics using substitutions, both before and after this one.","[There are two browser windows open on a computer screen.] [The first browser window, taking up most of the screen, but partly blocked by the other window at the bottom, has a Wikipedia article open.

1058: Old-Timers,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1058:_Old-Timers,computers,"You were on the internet before I was born? Well, so was I.","In this comic the man with the beard thinks he is Leet and tries to show this to his conversations partner by calling her noob (see also n00b). He claims that he has been on the internet since the BBS days, and thus long before his conversation partner was even born.  A Bulletin Board System, or BBS, is an online service based on microcomputers running appropriate software. They were the precursors to modern day online forums. So no one could have been on-line longer than him.  However, he is up against Science Girl who tells him he is wrong. She explains that her parents took samples of their sperm and egg and sequenced the DNA. The resulting genome was then e-mailed to the Venter Institute where they synthesized the genome and used this to create the egg and sperm that became Science Girl.  The J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) is a non-profit genomics research institute founded by J. Craig Venter, Ph.D. in October 2006. Although what Science Girl is describing may be possible this comic must take place in the future as this has not yet been used to create human beings.  Her point though is, that the man is wrong when he says that he has been on the internet. When you are ""on-line"" you are really just looking on the screen where the results found ""on"" the internet is displayed. So he has been looking at the internet. The girls genome (which is basically the closest you can come to the data a computer would need to create you) has been send on-line in an e-mail. So in her words, she has actually been there.  Objectively, the Science Girl is just as bad as her adult conversational partner; simply being the most significant advancement in test tube babies in over two decades doesn't prove anything about your personal knowledge or experience. Subjectively, however, her reputation alone is more than enough to stun and thus ""defeat"" anyone who actually understands her special heritage, as well as of course her pun and correction regarding being and looking on the internet.  The title text is another common retort from ""old timers"" that they have been doing X since before the younger person was born. In this case, Science Girl accepts that the old timer was ""on the Internet"" before she was born, but so was she... At least in the form of her genetic information.","[A man with black hair and a neck beard types away at his computer screen.] Man (typing): Whatever, noob.

1081: Argument Victory,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1081:_Argument_Victory,computers,"Really, the comforting side in most conspiracy theory arguments is the one claiming that anyone who's in power has any plan at all.","Cueball is arguing  with a conspiracy theorist, who is sitting in front of his computer talking back. They are probably using Skype, FaceTime, or another video calling service, as Cueball later asks  him to watch closely, holding his phone up to show the other guy what he is doing.   Cueball's opponent seems to ignore all reliable sources, like Snopes and Wikipedia on top of several journals, instead preferring sources that are seemingly not credible (but that do agree with him). These conspiracy "".net"" pages typically just have a black background and uses several different sizes of fonts, the larger (and probably also in bright colors), the more convincing, seems to be the belief, and Cueball cannot take these kind of sources seriously. "".net"" websites can be made by anyone and have little limitations. The maker of a "".net"" does not need to show sources of information, or even their name. As such, "".net"" websites are notoriously unreliable and often have viruses or other malware. The Truth about Black Helicopters is an example of one such website, supposedly explaining the truth behind government ""Black Helicopters"".  The conspiracy theorist insists that by trusting reliable sources, Cueball is simply buying in to the cover-up. Cueball says he can win the argument, and will show him how, and then ceases to argue further in favor of going down a waterslide while holding up the phone to show the other guy how to have a good time. Since conspiracy theorists tend to be intransigent, Cueball sees himself as the victor after ceasing to argue with a guy who cannot be argued with, and instead decides to have some fun. This is even improved by the fact that it makes his opponent angry.   The joke here is also in the title of the comic which is Argument Victory something that is very hard to achieve by on the web... Cueball won this victory not by arguing but by stopping this argument he was having with someone that could/would not be argued with.  The title text points out that belief in a conspiracy presupposes that those with the power to carry out the conspiracy actually have a plan, a situation which might be found more ""comforting"" than the alternative that those in power are just muddling through with no plan at all. This concept is revisited in 1274: Open Letter.","[Cueball, looking right, is talking at his smartphone while holding it up in front of his head using both hands.] Cueball: I can't believe you're so wrong.

The reply from the conspiracy theorist is shown to come out of the phone with a jagged arrow and likewise speech bubble.] Cueball: Watch closely— I'm about to win this argument.

Just remember to constantly bring up how cool it is that birds are dinosaurs and you'll be set.,"Cueball lost the server password and is asking Megan what it is. Megan correctly comments that she can't be sure through text-based messages that it's really Cueball asking for the password; it could be someone impersonating him attempting to socially engineer access to the server. Cueball answers by starting to develop a cryptographic protocol they can use for proof of identity, probably something like OTR Messaging as implemented in many XMPP chat clients or Feige–Fiat–Shamir identification scheme. In reality, it would already be too late for that — they should have prepared something beforehand. Before he even finishes, Megan answers ""It's you"", meaning that no one else is so geeky that they would answer like that. Cueball, dismayed at the fact that his geekery has become a defining characteristic of his and also at a lost opportunity to devise his protocol, shouts ""No!"".  In the title text, Randall suggests that this is, in fact, his own personality, and that anyone reading the comic can now impersonate him. For a bonus, he notes his own fascination with the fact that birds are just modern dinosaurs, which one could use to impersonate him as well.","Cueball: Hey, I lost the server password. What is it, again?  Megan: It's— ...Wait. How do I know it's really you?  Cueball: Ooh, good question! I bet we can construct a cool proof-of-identity protocol.

1226: Balloon Internet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1226:_Balloon_Internet,computers,I run a business selling rural internet access. My infrastructure consists of a bunch of Verizon wifi hotspots that I sign up for and then cancel at the end of the 14-day return period.,"The comic references Google's new Project Loon, a balloon powered Internet service which was officially announced June 14, 2013 and is currently in proof-of-concept testing stages. A test above New Zealand, involving about 30 balloons and about 50 users, was successfully conducted on June 16. The project, taglined ""Internet for Everyone"", is intended to eventually provide Internet access to people in rural areas and in disaster areas that have limited or no access to land-based Internet services.  Randall is poking fun at the tagline ""Internet for Everyone"" — meant to mean anyone could have Internet access regardless of location — by instead literally bringing the Internet to Cueball, who retired in a deserted area, away from all technology, to read a standard paper book. In the comic, one of the balloons sneaks up on Cueball before speaking and startling Cueball, effectively becoming a nuisance, interrupting Cueball's reading of a book and leaving Cueball wondering what has happened. In Randall's world, the tagline could be restated as ""Internet for Everyone — whether they want it or not"".  The title text describes Randall's own plan to provide rural internet. He will operate in a region where Verizon Wi-Fi infrastructure already exists, and take advantage of their 14-day return policy to effectively obtain internet access for free, which he will then sell under his own brand.","[Cueball sits on a hill reading a book.] [Cueball remains engrossed in the book.

1234: Douglas Engelbart (1925-2013),http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1234:_Douglas_Engelbart_(1925-2013),computers,Actual quote from The Demo: '... an advantage of being online is that it keeps track of who you are and what you're doing all the time...',"The comic describes and references The Mother of All Demos in honor of Douglas Engelbart, who died on July 2, 2013.  The demo is renowned for the numerous technologies Douglas' team introduced, which the comic references before sliding into apocryphal claims. At the first panel he presents various inventions, including the Computer Mouse. The second panel contains the opening lyrics of Leonard Cohen's song Hallelujah. The ""Secret Chord"" is a reference to his ""Chord Key Set"" he also presented at this demo. This relatively obscure device, essentially a piano with five keys, was meant as an alternative to the well-known keyboard. The third is a reference to contemporary internet memes, specifically cat pictures and YOLO.  The title text is a reference to recent revelations about spying by the United States National Security Agency, which was making headlines when this comic was published. While it might have seemed like an advantage at the time, in a modern context this aspect of the internet appears disturbing.  Several of the inventions presented by Douglas in 1968 were years ahead of their time, and many would prove to be very influential in the development of personal computing. Some of the technologies demonstrated found success in the following decades, while others did not.  Cathode ray tube  Computer mouse  Text movement/cloning  Joint file editing  E-mail  File sharing  Audio codec  The third panel exaggerates Douglas's claims to a hilarious and ridiculous level.

1238: Enlightenment,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1238:_Enlightenment,computers,"But the rules of writing are like magic spells. If you never acquire them, then not using them says nothing.","This comic is a reference to a scene one might imagine in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in which Yoda expresses doubt in a young Anakin's potential to join the Jedi order. Yoda delivers a speech similar to the one that Ponytail gives here, except that the end of the sequence he presents is ""the dark side"" instead of ""being an asshole"". Yoda is ultimately correct; Anakin's fears lead him to join the dark side so that he may keep his loved ones from dying; this is at the expense of the stability of the galaxy, however, and his actions are in vain, as his wife dies nonetheless. The circle on the ground is also taken from the Star Wars scene, and Cueball is presumably in the Mace Windu role.  Here, Randall compares Anakin's decision to join the dark side to the propensity of many Internet commenters to correct others on their spelling and grammar, and to the extreme prevalence of criticism over commendation or confirmation. Randall's point is that correcting people, like joining the dark side, ultimately stems from insecurity.  Ponytail and Cueball challenge Megan to type the sentence ""I heard you're idea's and their definately good"", which contains four common misspellings (you're instead of your, idea's instead of ideas [see greengrocers' apostrophe], their instead of they're, and definately instead of definitely) and a grammatical error (a missing comma before the word ""and""). Regarding the content, this sentence is one that is highly unlikely to be ever read in an internet argument, as almost every time people still have things they claim to know better about. Megan thus can't bring herself to typing this sentence, having spent so much time judging others for their trivial errors, even when they're saying helpful things like the sentence in question. Instead, it is strongly implied that she smashes the computer and runs away — demonstrating the sort of anger that ""Grammar Nazis"" and internet wiseacres like her can feel about punctuation and spelling errors, and about content-related errors respectively. Cueball and Ponytail remark on this, both failing to use apostrophes.  The title text refers to Terry Pratchett's novel Equal Rites, in which the characters discover that the most powerful magic is not using magic — with the distinction that not using magic because you don't know how is not the same as choosing to refrain from using magic when you do know how. Randall is comparing this with use or misuse of the rules of Standard English: not even knowing the rules is not admirable, whereas knowing the rules but choosing to disregard them is. There is also a double meaning - not writing anything at all is in fact ""saying nothing"".","[The two Internet Bodhisattvas Ponytail and Cueball lecture Megan encircled by a wheel placed upon the ground.] Ponytail: To achieve internet enlightenment, you must free yourself from insecurity. Megan: But insecurity keeps me humble! Ponytail: No. Insecurity leads to conceit. Conceit leads to judgment. Judgment leads to being an asshole. [A laptop is placed on a stand in front of Megan.] Megan: I'm ready. How do I begin? Ponytail: Type this sentence. [White text on black background.] I heard you're idea's and their definately good. [The laptop has been smashed to the floor. The circle, once full of hope and excitement, is now full of despair and no Megan.] Ponytail: She wasnt ready. Cueball: Its a difficult road."
1258: First,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1258:_First,computers,"Fortunately, exactly zero other annoying internet behaviors have developed during this time.","Cueball is commenting on the urge some people have to be the first to make a comment on any given posting, be it a blog post or a YouTube video or some other commentable content, and to obnoxiously point out that they have made the first comment. This often manifests as the poster simply posting the word ""First"" without contributing any actual content to the discussion.  In the first two panels, Cueball stares at his screen, implying that a long time passes before he finally points this out. He has probably submitted a post and is awaiting for comments that are not coming. Cueball might actually have mixed feelings about the practice slowly dying out. However, someone offscreen is worried he will jinx it, encouraging more people to do so. See also 269: TCMP and 1019: First Post.  The title text sarcastically states that no new annoying internet behaviors have emerged since the ""first post"" trend began which would continue to annoy users: a fact which is clearly wrong to anyone who spends a length of time on the internet. See for instance 493: Actuarial.","[Cueball sits at his desk, using a computer.]  [Cueball is still sitting at the desk, but with hands off the keyboard in his lap.]  [Cueball is in the same position as before, talking with off-panel.] Cueball: After a couple of unbearable decades, the ""first post"" thing seems to be dying a quiet death.

1305: Undocumented Feature,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1305:_Undocumented_Feature,computers,"And it doesn't pop up a box every time asking you to use your real name. In fact, there's no way to set your name at all. You just have to keep reminding people who you are.","An undocumented feature is a part of a software product that is not explained in the documentation for the product. Cueball has found such a feature, a chat room intended to ask for help, accessible through the help page of some unnamed old Windows utility. The people who found the chat room started out using it for its intended purpose (helping users of the utility by contacting other users), however as time has passed they have become friends and enter the chat only to talk to each other, with no relation to computer problems.  A virtual machine (or VM) is a computer program designed to emulate the hardware of a full computer. In this case, users of the old chat room create VMs only to have the old operating system installed which included the utility program. They use this setup only to access the old chat room. This is shown in the third panel where Cueball is using a modern laptop to enter the chatroom (presumably by means of a VM), whereas Ponytail is most likely using an old computer (as evidenced by the CRT monitor).  A chat room like this must be hosted on some outside server, so the narrator of the comic wonders who runs this server. An obvious thought about this is if and when the server will be shut down, effectively cutting all communication among chat users. Another obvious thought is why the utility author is still maintaining the chat server, since its original purpose of allowing communication between users with problems with the utility program is no longer an issue as everybody has migrated to more modern systems. The comic suggests that the reason for doing this can be a bored sysadmin, who is just reading the messages of the chat users and following their lives but never writing anything. This would turn the chat room into a soap opera for the sysadmin.  The Deep Web is a term used to refer to any information which is available online, but is hard to find (usually because there are no links to that information in web pages). The chat room described would be an example of this. From this point on, the comic takes an existentialist turn (a frequent xkcd trait), talking about how life is short, everything has to end, etc.  The last panel is a reference to Facebook's recent announcement that it would start autoplaying video ads, and the title text refers to YouTube requiring its users to use their real-life identities instead of just nicknames. These last parts of the comics somehow reveal that the point of the whole comic is just to complain about aggressive money-driven policies used by modern social networks in general and Facebook in particular. It is hinted that Randall would prefer older technologies, where limited resources would forbid autoplaying videos or huge databases with every detail of every user's life.  It's possible that the comic is about an actual chat room, but more likely it is a complete invention, since if it were real someone would have been able to trace its origin. However, if it is real, the participants would not want to confirm this in order to protect their privacy.  The title text mentions the simplicity of this chat; even user names do not exist and other users could only be identified by their behavior because the user names are random and can change on every login.  There are many examples of undocumented features in programs written for old versions of Windows, for example:","[A support window is shown.] An old Windows utility has an undocumented feature. If you open ""help"" and click on the background, you get dropped into a ""support"" chat room. Support Window: Launching support forum...  [An active conversation between two people is shown.] Only a few of us ever found it. But we became friends.  [Cueball and Ponytail are at computers.] We kept launching the program to check in. Eventually some of us were running VMs just to keep accessing it.  [Another conversation.] As the Internet aged, so did we.  [Three question marks.] We don't know who runs the server. We don't know why it's still working so many years later. Maybe we're some sysadmin's soap opera.

[The bubble is now smaller, and some parts of a web are shown.] A life's worth of chat,  [More of the web is shown.] Buried in the deep web.

'Show me that thing I was looking at a moment ago' might just be too complicated an idea for the modern web.,"Infinite scrolling is a technique in web design where a large data set is displayed as a seemingly infinite list, but in reality only the visible part of the list (and the surrounding data) is rendered. This is done to work around memory limitations of old browsers and mobile devices or to save on data transfer size.  The problem with this technique is that if you navigate from this page to a different page and go back, the location of the scrolled data set is often lost and the top of the data set is displayed again. Also it is usually not possible to point a URL directly to a certain section of the infinite list, a practice known as deep linking. For these reasons, many prefer pagination, the method traditionally used in books, over infinite scrolling.  In this comic Megan is handling the book gingerly as if it were a device with a touchscreen where the book is displayed as an infinite scrolling text. Touching a link would navigate away from the list and the current reading position would be lost.  In the title text it is an ironic suggestion that the ""back"" button is now useless. The back-button is supposed to give you this functionality but due to the failure to implement continuous scrolling sites and deep-linking correctly they are typically useless when the user is reading infinite-scrolling data (or worse, flat-out counterproductive, giving you the wrong page).","[Megan stands at a desk, reading a book, touching it very gingerly. Cueball is standing behind her. Cueball: Why are you turning the pages like that? Megan: If I touch the wrong thing, I'll lose my place and have to start over.  If books worked like infinite-scrolling webpages"
1333: First Date,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1333:_First_Date,computers,"I sympathize with the TPP protagonist because I, too, have progressed through a surprising number of stages of life despite spending entire days stuck against simple obstacles.","TPP, or Twitch Plays Pokémon, was the first of a creative and radical new variant of streaming gameplay videos created in early 2014 — a few days before this comic was released.  Some consumers enjoyed watching video games being played by other people (usually 'popular' gamers known for entertaining gameplay), thus streaming sites dedicated to streaming gameplay were created. Twitch.tv was one such site.  Whereas traditional video game streams involved the channel broadcaster or another personality playing the game, the channel ""Twitch Plays Pokémon"" recorded a bot playing an emulated game of Pokémon Red for Game Boy. The game inputs given by the bot were based on players' messages in the video stream itself. Thus, the watchers of the stream were playing the game themselves using chat ""commands."" The Pokémon character behaved incredibly erratically, frequently getting ""stuck against simple obstacles"" (as mentioned in the title-text) and moving about in a strange manner (""Why are you up there?""/""Bye...Okay, coming back now"").   Despite this, the character advanced surprisingly far in games. They have beaten the Elite Four and Champion of generations I, II, III, IV, and V, and VI.  Twitch Plays Pokémon is currently on its second season, and will play Pokémon Colosseum next. You can see the state of the player characters' Pokémon and inventory at game end in this Bulbapedia article.   TPP surged in popularity rapidly since its inception, reaching 80,000 channel viewers within five days. Derivative channels (such as 'TwitchPlayers') soon arose, turning ""Twitch Plays..."" into an idea rather than a single channel; that of crowdsourcing a task, such as controlling a single person (as in the Pokémon games) for erratic and often hilarious results. The stream, which is still active as of this writing, has reached memetic status.  In the above comic, Cueball and Megan are on a date. However, Megan is behaving very erratically. Cueball determines that Megan is being ""controlled by Twitch,"" as her behavior matches well with that of the TPP protagonist (whose name, canonically, is Red).   Megan loudly declares at one point that she is ""SAVING"" her 'game progress', referencing the incessant saving in TPP via random button presses. The random ten-letter string she says is reminiscent of the nicknames that all of TPP's Pokémon end up with as the players move haphazardly across the game's keyboard.   Her fascination with the ""cool spiral"" is an allusion to TPP players' fascination with the Helix Fossil, an in-game item. As user input often leads to checking of the in-game backpack followed by erratic commands to handle the items within, it was common for various valuable items to be haphazardly thrown away. However, players quickly discovered that the Helix Fossil, as a key item, could not be tossed. The players' realization that the Helix Fossil would stay in the bag almost permanently throughout the game caused TPP players to jokingly regard it with a near-religious reverence for its constant appearance, with many acting as if the protagonist was ""looking to the Helix for guidance"".  The title text, as explained above, simply is a light-hearted joke from Randall, empathizing with TPP as he has also spent real-life days stuck against simple obstacles, and is surprised by how far he has gotten in life despite this fact.","[Cueball and Megan sit at an intimate dinner table. They have plates and glasses of wine in front of them.] Cueball: So, did you grow up around here? Megan: I love you. Cueball: ... huh? Megan: Waiter! One of everything on the menu.  [Megan stands up. Standing on her chair, she's holding a plate.] Cueball: Why are you up there? Megan: I'm stuck. This plate looks delicious. Aaaoogaoag.

1334: Second,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1334:_Second,computers,"Let me just scroll down and check behind that rock. Annnnd... nope, page copyright year starts with '19'. Oh God, is this a WEBRING?","Google is a popular search engine. Google's searching algorithms are widely regarded as the most accurate and useful. If your search terms were sufficiently detailed, you will be able to find what you were looking for on the first page. Having to view the second page indicates your search terms were too vague or the answer to your query doesn't exist. Especially when the search results are a thousand or more items, only the very first results are mapping to the real idea of the user. The second page is not helpful for the issue.  Cueball, after failing to find his query in the first page of results, takes a curious peek at the second page. This is represented by a not-at-all subtle metaphor in which Cueball is about to wander into a sun-baked desert. According to the title text, he finds one vaguely relevant webpage, but it's over 17 years old.  The title text refers to webrings. Webrings consist of multiple websites that are connected together, usually with a common theme. They connect from one website to the next, eventually leading back to the starting site. They were popular in the 1990s as a way of boosting your search ranking, but newer algorithms in Google and other search engines are now detecting and penalizing web sites for such tactics. Webrings were also used in pre-google days to make it easy to find websites sharing a common theme, but since one site going down broke the ring, they were very inefficient. Seeing a webring means a site has not been updated since the mid 90s.","[Cueball in a desert standing before a rock.] Rock: Greetings, stranger. Rock: Whatever quest drives you, abandon it.

1348: Before the Internet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1348:_Before_the_Internet,computers,We watched DAYTIME TV. Do you realize how soul-crushing it was? I'd rather eat an iPad than go back to watching daytime TV.,"A girl with a ponytail asks Megan what life was like before the Internet. The girl obviously was born after the Internet was invented. Megan responds that life was very boring without computers or mobile phones. This comic appears to be a parody of the common complaint — often done by elder people — that life was better and more fulfilling in the ""good old days"", in that there weren't so many distractions and people could actually get things done that were meaningful. The ages switch roles with the younger character being prepared to believe that life was more fulfilling before technology, and the elder rejecting the proposition.  To Megan, even a more fulfilling and engaging life ""wasn't worth"" the price of what it meant to be bored in the days before smartphones and computers that could go online. Even though the ponytail girl says that she still experiences boredom in spite of having advanced technology to occupy her, Megan assures her that her version of boredom is nothing like what those in the pre-Internet days had to endure. Again, this is a reversal of the typical exchange in which a young person tries to insist that they still have social contact/get out and about/do worthwhile things in their spare time, and the elder person responds, ""Not like we did.""  The title text continues in this vein as Megan talks about what people in her day resorted to doing when they were bored, for lack of anything better to do: they watched daytime TV. Daytime television consisted mainly of soap operas, talk shows, game shows, infomercials and children's programming and is notorious for being, in Megan's words, ""soul-crushing"". To round off the comparison, Megan uses a modern-day metaphor to express her extreme distaste for daytime television, saying that she would rather ""eat an iPad"" than go through that again. In other words, modern-day gadgets are so much better that she'd still have more fun if she were eating them than if she had to go without them.  Megan might just be responding with the opposite of what she's expected to say in this dialogue in order to mess with the younger girl. In reality, life was neither likely to be noticeably more fulfilling or noticeably more boring without technology: it was just life. People are equally capable of wasting their time and of doing worthwhile things regardless of what age they live in, and those who wax nostalgic about an older, better time are liable to forget that. This recalls the Hedonic treadmill theory which states that people will always be at roughly the same level of happiness regardless of positive or negative events or technological advances in civilization.","[Young girl talking to Megan, both holding smartphones.]  Girl: Do you remember before the internet? Megan: Oh yeah, totally. Girl: what was it like? Megan: Not having a phone or computer to distract you? Girl: Yeah. Megan: It was SO. BORING. All the time. I just sat there. It was the worst. Girl: But wasn't it, like, more fulfilling? Engaging? Megan: Wasn't worth it. Girl: I still get bored. Megan: Not like we did."
1361: Google Announcement,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1361:_Google_Announcement,computers,The less popular 8.8.4.4 is slated for discontinuation.,"At the time of this comic's release, Vic Gundotra had recently left Google. Because he was the head of Google+, this has caused many people, including TechCrunch, to theorize that Google+ is going to be shut down, despite the continuing comments from Google that it will remain active and updated.  Google has a history of closing popular services listed.  The comic extrapolates this to an announcement that Google would be closing all its popular services, up to and including its e-mail service, Gmail, and even the core business of the company, its Internet search engine, to wholly concentrate on a relatively obscure part of its product lineup. According to Google, its Public DNS servers (Domain Name System servers), better known by their IPv4 addresses 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, are supposed to be a faster alternative to using one's ISP's DNS servers (because of caching effects due to a large user base), as well as less susceptible to censorship. When Turkey started blocking access to Twitter and YouTube in March 2014, Turkish ISPs first did this on the DNS level by manipulating the results from their own name servers. The most popular workaround was using Google's DNS server instead, so much so that its address was written as graffiti on the side of a building.  The joke may also be related to the fact that 8.8.8.8 is an IP address heavily used by network administrators to perform connectivity tests (ping) because it is easy to remember and fast to type. Google would want to concentrate on this feature to build a business model using that fact.  The reason behind this decision may be that Google considers a DNS server, a fairly low-level component of the Internet's service stack, to be the optimal place to collect information on its users, an accusation leveled at Google ever since it introduced the service.  The title text refers to the impression held by some that Google will shut down services that prove less popular than desired at short notice, even though they may in fact have a significant user base. A recent example of that is the closure of the RSS aggregation service, Google Reader, in July 2013. While the same DNS service is provided under both addresses, the more memorable 8.8.8.8 is likely to receive far more requests than 8.8.4.4.  Google quickly responded with an acknowledgement of XKCD. The TXT record for the DNS name of IP address 8.8.8.8 was set to ""http://xkcd.com/1361/"", as can be seen via these various commands (for Microsoft Windows usually only nslookup will work)","[Cueball is standing at a lectern marked Google.] Cueball: The rumors are true.

1370: President,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1370:_President,computers,Anyone who thinks we're all going to spend the 2032 elections poring over rambling blog posts by teenagers has never tried to read a rambling blog post by a teenager.,"This strip shows a discussion between an adult and a teenager about an aspect of the future. Randall likes this setup, allowing to put in perspective the various ""decay"" predictions and shows his optimism.  Here, the subject is scandal. How will a generation that is documenting and leaving behind a permanent public record of its juvenile misadventures - immature and impolitic writings, photographs of inebriation at parties posted on Facebook, Twitter posts about breakups, etc. - produce successful future politicians? Won't future opposition researchers and reporters have enough embarrassing material to destroy any Millennial's public reputation? In previous generations, juveniles were freer to go through this phase of development without leaving behind a digital record, making it easier to sidestep or paper over rumors of youthful misbehavior. See, e.g., George W. Bush, who dismissed questions about his rumored use of drugs in his youth by saying only, ""When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.""  The child's answer, in addition to teasing the adult about her generation's coming obsolescence, is that the next generation will be fine because in the future no one will care. The title text amplifies this optimistic message, suggesting that old blog posts by former teenagers will just seem boring, not salacious. Randall offers no explanation for this upbeat spin, but it is a recurring topic and some have argued elsewhere that the potential power of Internet-chronicled youthful indiscretions will be defused because everyone will be in the same boat, making future voters (and, in another context, employers) more tolerant of such things.  The strip also contains an existential twist, as shown in the child's answer. It alludes to every generation's dismissal of the next, as actually being due to psychological insecurities. We may disguise our dismissals by attacking their faults & different lifestyles. But in truth, these dismissals are actually rooted in our innate fear of becoming obsolete, useless, surpassed, and lost in a bewildering world that has passed us by.",[Ponytail and Science Girl are walking together.] Ponytail: I can't imagine anyone who grew up on the Internet being able to run for President.

1434: Where Do Birds Go,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1434:_Where_Do_Birds_Go,computers,Water/ice has a lot of weird phases. Maybe asking 'where do birds go when it rains' is like asking 'where does Clark Kent go whenever Superman shows up?',"Cueball searches Google to find out where birds go when it rains. He finds that the question is asked worldwide, across many different languages and websites. A variety of screenshots are shown of different websites and forums where users have asked where birds go when it rains, with at least nine languages shown. The bottom of this panel fades to white, suggesting that the occurrence of these questions stretches on and on. Cueball expresses delight at the idea that this question is the one to which everyone wants to know the answer; worrying about birds getting wet is ""the thing that unites us"".  Later in the comic, a bird in the rain is also searching on the Internet for where birds go when it rains. This is humorously implying that a significant set of these questions are being typed by birds looking for a dry place after being caught in the rain, and not humans. This makes Cueball wrong; worrying about birds getting wet does not unite us. In reality, as the comic states, birds look for shelter so they can stay dry. On a rainy day you can usually find birds in leafy trees, caves or other kinds of cover.  In the Superman comics, Clark Kent is Superman, so you never observe both Clark Kent and Superman simultaneously. By analogy, the title text whimsically suggests that a possible inference from the observation that you never see birds and rain together is that birds are the rain. Perhaps birds are an unknown phase of water. In addition to its familiar phases of ice, vapor, and liquid water, water has more exotic phases such as low-temperature and high-pressure ices and supercritical gases; why not birds?  The title text imbues the question with more philosophical significance than it warrants (prompted, perhaps, by Cueball's earlier hyperbole), and points up the irrationality of the implication that a question must be deep simply because a lot of people ask it, and that such questions demand a complex, radical answer.      Ok, maybe I'm an idiot for asking this, but during the slew of several storms in California the last couple weeks, I began to wonder where the poor birds go to stay dry?

1454: Done,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1454:_Done,computers,"I'm sorry, but the author of this Facebook comment clearly believes you were.","This comic is a joke about the hyperbolic expression shut it down being taken literally. If someone thinks that a device has achieved its goal they shut it down. After an idea or product that people think is well made is created people will joke that the process that created it should be shut down, as if the process has achieved its ultimate purpose. This is most often used sarcastically for an inferior product or idea. Taking things literally is a common theme in the xkcd comics.  Curly-hair sits at a computer anxiously and nervously writing a message to someone she cares about deeply, possibly a child to be adopted or a romantic interest. Curly-hair plans on saving enough money to have the person flown to her location from ""half a world away."" Curly-hair ends the message with a promise to communicate daily until the two are able to meet. When attempting to send the message, however, Curly-hair discovers that their internet connection is down and the message goes unsent.  Ponytail explains there was a ""ridiculous video"" to which someone had commented ""That's it. Shut down the Internet. We're done."" This was taken literally and, because enough people agreed with this comment, the internet was shut down and Curly-hair was left unable to communicate with her love.  The joke being that the internet was creating something far more valuable between Curly-hair and her love than a ridiculous video, thus highlighting the beautiful and far reaching potential impact of the internet. The likelihood of the entire internet being shut down based on a single comment being vanishingly low adds to the humor.  In the final panel Curly-hair states wistfully that she was not done with the internet. The title text is Ponytail's response, which asserts Ponytail's belief that Curly-hair's message could not be important because the Facebook comment asserted that nothing of any significance could come from the internet after the ridiculous video.","Writer (typing): I had started to think I was asking too much, that I needed to settle.

1631: Longer Than Usual,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1631:_Longer_Than_Usual,computers,"--> [ Well, this is embarrassing. ] <--'","The comic starts a small flow chart with ""This seems to be taking longer than usual."" It then presents two alternative continuations of the sentence, which radically alter the interpretation of the starting sentence, resulting in humor.  ""This seems to be taking longer than usual"" is an error message displayed by Gmail (see here) and other software, for example Disqus, (see here). We realize the allusion to Gmail by the first continuation, ""Try reloading Gmail if the problem persists"".  In the second continuation, ""Maybe we should just go to bed"", the opening instead refers to a person suffering from sexual performance anxiety, taking ""longer than usual"" to achieve either orgasm or erection, probably despite considerable efforts of their partner. Often such frustration then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that renders orgasm/erection virtually impossible by ruining the mood. In such situations it is likely that one or the other partner becomes frustrated and gives up, suggesting ""let's go to bed"" instead of 'pointlessly' continuing the sexual activity.  The title text ties both interpretations together by referencing an infamous error message given by the Firefox internet browser. As an error message, it fits nicely with the Gmail interpretation of the comic, though it is equally likely to be used as an apology or frustrated slight in the sexual interpretation. It would be a likely next line after ""this is taking longer than usual"". Alternatively, it would be embarrassing to get the two responses confused, thus necessitating a flowchart as a guide.  It could also simply be a jab to people who stay online late even when doing nothing, as when a lag occurs, and finally realising it might be better to switch off the computer and go to bed; or people who stay up late obsessed that ""Someone is wrong on the internet"".  This is not the first time Randall juxtaposes sex and more abstract topics, such as sex and math in 487: Numerical Sex Positions or sex and engineering in 592: Drama","[A flowchart with one starting bubble at the top.

1732: Earth Temperature Timeline,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1732:_Earth_Temperature_Timeline,computers,"[After setting your car on fire] Listen, your car's temperature has changed before.","This comic is a timeline on how the temperature has changed from 20,000 BCE (Before Common Era) to the present day (2016), with three predictions for the rest of the 21st century depending on what actions are taken (or not taken) to stop CO₂ emission. This comic is a direct, but much more thorough, follow up on the previous global warming comic: 1379: 4.5 Degrees. By having readers scroll through millennia of slow-paced natural changes, Randall uses the comic to confront the the rapid temperature rise in the recent years.   Over the past 100 years, human action has produced a large amount of CO₂ emissions, which have caused a rise in average global temperature through the greenhouse effect. This is called global warming and is part of a climate change, a subject that has become a recurrent subject on xkcd. There are still many people who claim that this is not happening, or at least that it is not caused by any human actions, called climate change deniers. One argument of theirs is that global warming is happening for natural causes, summarized with the phrase ""temperature has changed before"".  This comic shows that while temperature changes have indeed occurred before, the speed of the current temperature rise is much, much faster than those measured for many previous thousands of years. The comic became so popular that Randall postponed the release of his next comic to keep this one on the front page one day longer.   The temperature curve is a dotted line most of the time, but from about 1850 to 2016 the measurement data is good enough to let the curve become a solid line indicating that this is not an estimate. Before 1850 the temperature is an estimate based on the sources given. And likewise into the future the three possible curves are also dotted to show that they are predictions, based on how seriously the population of Earth takes knowledge (and comics) like this.   Although this is a topic Randall obviously takes very seriously, and by far most of the facts fit with known history, he still includes several jokes in the comic. See also the table explaining each item in the comic. So after the election of a climate change denier later in the year of this comic's release, several sad comics has been posted. Some of the reason could be that Randall no longer believes that even his worst fears (as expressed by the current path at the bottom) will hold up, when USA gets a president, who will on purpose act in a way that scientist claims will make the temperature rise even more. See more here.  The title text compares the saying that ""the temperature has changed before"" comparing temperature changes over thousands of years to the rapid global warming over the last century with saying that the ""small"" changes to the temperature a car experiences over the years of normal usage should not make you worried over the rapid temperature increase that happens when someone sets your car on fire. A related joke was used recently in 1693: Oxidation.  The image attributes climate data sources as ""Shakun et al. (2012), Marcott et al. (2013), Annan and Hargreaves (2013), HadCRUT4, IPCC"":  Note there are several spelling errors in the comic, so please do only correct spelling errors that are not part of the comic!

And arrow pointing left to the left of the center and another pointing right to the right of the center has labels. Below these is the temperature scale of the X-axis, with 9 ticks between the borders each with a label ranging from -4 to +4°C compared to the 1961-1990 average, but with another step in each direction not labeled towards to axis so the chart covers -5 to +5°C compared to the 1961-1990 average.] Temperature  Compared to the 1961-1990 average Start Colder Warmer -4°C -3°C -2°C -1°C 0°C +1°C +2°C +3°C +4°C  [To the right of the chart is a gray text standing on the side down along the outer boarder of the chart with the sources for the chart:]  Source: Shakun et. al.

The two central columns are white, and then from there to the left the background becomes a faded color that changes from light blue to blue at the edge in four steps. Similarly to the right the color changes from light red to red. To the left there is a time scale taking 500 years leaps from 20,000 BCE all the way to year 1, where there are two years, one for BBC and one for CE. The 500 year leaps continue until 1500 CE and from there the steps are down to 100 years until 2100 with also present day 2016 labeled. After 1500 the CE is omitted. The labels stop there, but there is space below covering down to 2200 CE. There is clearly visible division line across the chart on the level of each of the 500 step, and fainter lines for each of the 100 steps all the way even though only the last 5 of these 100 steps are labeled. There is a similar clear line at 2016. Below each step on the Y-axis is noted, and then any text starting before the next step is noted below indented. If there are extra image belonging to text this is indented once more. The graph that the whole chart is about is a dotted line that begins at the “start” point mentioned above at -4.3°C and then begins to go straight down. It will change left and right all the way down. To being with all text and most drawings are to right of the dotted curve. Whenever something is to the left it will be noted.

1773: Negativity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1773:_Negativity,computers,[Google search] how do I block my lawn,"Cueball is going outside for some fresh air because he wants to escape the trolls of the Internet, which is known for hosting several hostile and unpleasant ideas and people. However, as he walks, some grass speaks up to insult him, and Cueball is upset to find that he hasn't escaped the negativity at all. (see 1749: Mushrooms which involves an unusual occurrence of a vocalizing angry mushroom).  The title text expands on this, with him searching Google for how to ""block the lawn"". Blocking someone refers to a standard setting on websites and online services that can prevent certain users from communicating with you, but it is as yet unknown how this would work for a lawn insulting you. This is made ironic by the fact he is using the Internet to find an Internet technique (blocking) on a non-Internet object, while at the start of the comic, he just wanted to escape the Internet.  The term ""blocking"" is actually used in lawn-care to refer to techniques where sunlight is restricted from reaching the lower parts of the grass stems and to persuade the root system to grow deeper into the soil.  The negativity Cueball meets on-line is likely due to the results of the recent 2016 United States presidential election and this one was released only three days before the U.S. Electoral College voted for Donald Trump to become the 45th president of the United States, and this was still a bit exciting as there where rumors/hopes that some of the electors would not vote for Trump. (But only two changed away from Trump!) That this is likely is further supported with other recent comics. The first of these 1761: Blame is almost a prequel to this one, as it is about being sad about what happens on-line. This comic here was thus the second sad comics following the election, culminating shortly after his inauguration with a comic simply titled 1790: Sad. (See more on other depressive comic in this trivia.)  Later in 1802: Phone, Cueball cannot go outside for a walk without bringing his phone as he cannot stand to be disconnected from his feed, which is the exact opposite of what he tries in this comic. Although in the title text he does try to disconnect, he then finds that this is also bad because it leads to social isolation.","[Cueball walking on grass] Cueball: It's nice to get outside, away from the pain and negativity of the internet,  [Cueball stops walking] Cueball: And just enjoy the cool breeze and the grass under my feet.

149: Sandwich,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/149:_Sandwich,computers,Proper User Policy apparently means Simon Says.,"On a UNIX computer system, users can be assigned to all kinds of rights, for example rights to access to certain directories and files to execute certain commands. The sudo command lets certain (authorized) users override these policies by executing the command (everything after the word ""sudo"" on the command line) as the root user. Root (sometimes called the superuser) has complete system powers, exempt from all access controls. One very common activity for UNIX administrators is to install or configure software using the UNIX make command, e.g. % make install.  Often this command requires administrative permissions in order to complete successfully, which in practice means the ""make this"" command will fail unless it is typed as ""sudo make this"" instead. Forgetting to start the command with ""sudo"" is a fairly common and frustrating mistake for people who administer UNIX systems or their personal Linux computer. They then need to repeat the command with ""sudo,"" whereupon the computer responds obediently, and everything works smoothly.  Cueball is demanding a sandwich from his friend. Not being properly asked, the friend denies the request. Cueball then (ab)uses the sudo command on the friend, who then has no choice but to go and make the sandwich, and now does so without complaint, because Cueball has all the rights. For anyone versed in installing system software with the make command, this exchange is intensely reminiscent of the analogous onscreen experience.  Simon Says is a children's game in which a leader gives various commands that must be followed if and only if (iff) the leader prefixes the command with ""Simon says."" The title text compares the way the computer will run some commands if they are preceded with ""sudo"" to the way Simon Says players are supposed to follow orders if (and only if) they are preceded with ""Simon says.""  Alternatively, the title text might merely be referring to the similarity between Cueball ordering his friend around with ""sudo"" to the Simon Says game leader ordering other players around. Wikipedia suggests  that the ""Simon"" in the name of the game may be the powerful lord Simon de Montfort, or a corruption of Cicero, both of whom were influential politicians of their day.","[Cueball is sitting on a couch, talking to a Cueball-like friend.] Cueball: Make me a sandwich. Friend: What? Make it yourself. Cueball: Sudo make me a sandwich. Friend: Okay."
178: Not Really Into Pokemon,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/178:_Not_Really_Into_Pokemon,computers,"As of this writing, Ubuntu 6.10 and Firefox 2.0 have left my computer a complete mess.","Pokémon is a popular franchise that includes 5 children's animated television shows, a collectible card game, and a whole series of video games. The premise is that a young ""trainer"" goes out to explore the world and catch Pokémon: fanciful wild creatures that come in many varieties, ranging from armoured dinosaurs that have drills for horns to robotic bugs that change their type depending on the items they are holding. When the trainer comes across wild Pokémon or other trainers, they use their Pokémon to fight each other.  In this comic, Randall claims that ""I'm not really into Pokémon"" can serve as an all-purpose phrase of condescending dismissal. The implied insult to the thing being dismissed can include:  The example in the comic is Black Hat dismissing Ubuntu, an open-source computer operating system. Ubuntu may have been particularly chosen as specifically suitable for the ""Pokémon dismissal"" for reasons such as:  The title text refers to the complications that new software releases can have on computers, especially if either the release is an alpha or beta release, or if the computer is rather old. Randall specifically mentions Ubuntu 6.10 and Firefox 2.0, both of which were officially released around two weeks after this comic was posted, so the versions causing problems were certainly pre-release editions. While Randall does not detail any specific issues, the title text may paint a picture of two computer programs fighting each other inside the computer and making a mess in the process, as if they were Pokémon.","I have found the perfect phrase for condescendingly dismissing anything: Cueball: Have you seen the new Ubuntu release? Black Hat: Nah, I'm not really into Pokémon."
196: Command Line Fu,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/196:_Command_Line_Fu,computers,"When designing an interface, imagine that your program is all that stands between the user and hot, sweaty, tangled-bedsheets-fingertips-digging-into-the-back sex.","The Linux command line allows a user to make their computer do nearly anything. The only hitch is that the interface is entirely text-based, and reading through user manuals to find the commands that you need can take a very long time.  In this comic, Cueball recounts how he used a command line hack to solve a problem with his monitors turning off during a movie. However, in the time that he spends trying to solve the issue, the woman he had brought home had already left, and his need for a movie to watch was gone.  The title text is the supposed moral to this story: if your user interface takes as long to operate as a command line, you may very well be denying your users the chance to get laid.  Software that jiggles the mouse actually exists, as well as instructions for linux scripting (although installing the necessary libraries might take a while).","[Two men talking.] Cueball: Last night I was watching videos with this girl and my monitors kept turning off - even though I had disabled power save. Friend: Odd. Cueball: However! I wrote a command to jiggle the mouse pointer every couple minutes to keep it from going idle. Friend: Not the first hack I'd try, but see? Linux has problems, but it gives you the tools to deal with them - and save your date! Cueball: Actually, I was half an hour into the pointer scripting documentation when she got dressed and left."
215: Letting Go,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/215:_Letting_Go,computers,At least I never gave her the root password.,"In fiction, a character who has had a romantic relationship end will be shown taking some act to remove a sign of their partner's presence in their life, e.g. removing/selling a wedding or engagement ring, removing the partner's toiletries from the bathroom, or deleting the partner's phone number from a cell phone. This is used to symbolize that the character has accepted the end of the relationship and is ready to move on, no longer pining for their loss or seeking to restore the relationship.  The first three panels imply that Cueball was presumably in a now-terminated relationship with Megan. The final panel shows him using the Unix command 'userdel' to delete her user account from his computer. The joke here is that he considers this to be a significant part of accepting that she is no longer a part of his life, where most people would consider it a routine administrative task.  The title text refers to Cueball's thankfulness that he never gave Megan the password to the administrator ('root') account on the computer. It is unclear why this is; he might be worried that she would have used the access to perform malicious actions after the breakup, or simply glad to be spared the need to change the root password. Alternately, it could be a metaphor for marriage and/or a closer emotional relationship, and he is glad that he did not allow her an even greater hold on his heart before the breakup (which would, of course, have entailed commensurately more pain when she did leave him). Not sharing the root password is indicative of a lack of trust in their relationship, which could be a factor in the initial breakdown.","[Cueball is holding a picture of himself and Megan in a heart; it has been ripped down the middle, separating the two people.]  [Cueball sits at computer, looking at the picture.]  [It is night.

272: Linux User at Best Buy,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/272:_Linux_User_at_Best_Buy,computers,We actually stand around the antivirus displays with the Mac users just waiting for someone to ask.,"Best Buy is an American chain of electronics and media stores. As with many such big box shops, they only sell pre-bundled software and boxed pre-built hardware, where the computers on offer are either Macs or other PCs, usually pre-installed with some variant of the Mac OS X or Windows NT operating system families. Most personal computer hackers/enthusiasts (as opposed merely to workaday computer users) wouldn't be caught dead buying a pre-made computer, preferring instead to build their own using self-selected hardware components and install and configure their own preferred operating systems and software. As such, the subtext is that somebody buying a complete pre-packaged home computer system at Best Buy wouldn't know or care much about computers.  The salesperson is trying to sell antivirus software to Cueball because selling such software (e.g. Norton or Kaspersky) to prospective Windows PC owners is generally a good sales tactic. The vast majority of all computer malware is engineered specifically to exploit Windows, and Windows' inherent anti-malware protection might most charitably be described with the phrase ""lacklustre, but not as bad as before."" Windows users therefore will want antivirus protection, especially for use on a brand new machine that will soon be connected up to the Internet. Moreover, because the ecosystem of viruses and malware that thrive by infecting Windows PCs is constantly evolving (see 350: Network) and being redesigned to take advantage of new exploits and fool last-month's antivirus software, it is quite prudent for a Windows PC owner to always keep their malware protection absolutely up-to-date, and many such security suites need to be regularly renewed with new versions.  While some viruses and malware can afflict Linux, in general UNIX and workalike operating systems of its type (e.g. BSD) are far more robust and secure than Windows, with fewer exploitable vulnerabilities; so, Cueball is confident (probably rightly so) that he will be fine without added security. Moreover, Linux is free software, so although malware protection usually isn't necessary for it, excepting for tasks requiring very high security standards (such as on servers and supercomputers), if extra protection is desired by the user, it is generally easily obtainable, often gratis.  Back in 2007, after the commercial failure that was Windows Vista and with a stagnant Mac market, many in the Linux community believed that Linux would soon wipe out Windows as the operating system of choice for desktop PCs, after years of slow-but-steady growth. This explains the cheeky triumphalism of the final panels of the comic, in which Cueball hops on his quick, slick vehicle and speeds away. It's worth noting that  The title text makes sense in light of the fact that, like Linux, the software design of OS X (both are based on Unix, OS X through Darwin - see 676: Abstraction) limits the amount of harm that can be done by malicious software, and Macs thus also have fewer viruses and malware than Windows. Apparently, Mac and Linux users flock together just waiting for some salesperson to come along and mistake them for someone gullible enough to use Windows. This is taking the piss out of the smugness sometimes to be found among Mac and Linux users, who may view their preferred systems as hip and different from the ""mainstream"" Microsoft systems that they feel are manifestly inferior.","Salesman: Interested in updating your antivirus software?

278: Black Hat Support,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/278:_Black_Hat_Support,computers,So as not to leave you hanging -- it was a problem with select() calls.,"This strip portrays Black Hat providing support for Linux, but in fact he provides only annoying and unhelpful advice just for his own personal amusement.  The support line is clearly for Linux, as stated in the introduction, and the client on the phone clearly has a Linux problem. However, Black Hat is intentionally giving irrelevant instructions that refer to the Windows OS (Start Menu, My Documents Folder).  Finally, Black Hat asks the client on the phone to ""bear with him"" and suggests that the client should use a highly obsolete mechanism to look for the answer to his problem, namely AOL keywords. AOL is well known for producing one of the earlier online communities and has since fallen largely out of favor. The client hangs up the phone.  The title text mentions the function select(), which allows you to write asynchronous IO access routines by checking if it is ready to be read/written to at a specific moment. This is different than a threaded model, in that it can happen in a single thread. The danger of such programming is that if you do not coordinate the reader/writer properly, you can create a deadlock, which can result in the consumption of a lot of resources.","[Black Hat is sitting at his computer, wearing a phone headset.] Black Hat: Thank you for calling the Black Hat Support Line, your first source for Linux support.

340: Fight,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/340:_Fight,computers,And she put sweet nothings in all my .conf files. It'll take me forever to get X working again.,"The boot sector of a hard drive is where the information for operating systems is stored. It tells the computer to load a program; in most cases this is an operating system. If this sector is overwritten, an operating system stored on the drive can't be booted into.  The first two panels indicate that Megan is still mad at Cueball from a fight from the night before and the third panel shows promise of her forgiving him through an overly affectionate love note. However, the last panel reveals that she used the love note to overwrite the boot sector of Cueball's computer out of anger.  The .conf files of Linux- and Unix-based systems are text based files where all the settings for various applications are stored. Since all the configurations were replaced with ""sweet nothings"" - whispered lovers' talk, or literal nothings (blank space or meaningless jumbles of characters) - none of the programs work as they should. X is the X Window System, the most common GUI framework used on modern Linux and Unix systems. Once upon a time it was notoriously hard to configure correctly, even when starting from a known good configuration, let alone a destroyed one.  (More recent versions of X configure themselves correctly for most users without a .conf file.)","We had a fight last night.

434: xkcd Goes to the Airport,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/434:_xkcd_Goes_to_the_Airport,computers,"Under three ounces, but it stains panties.","The various characters of xkcd cause problems at the airport due to their various quirks.  Panel 1: Beret Guy and Megan are lost, following each other in a loop. Beret Guy displays his obsession with baked goods as he also does in later comics: 442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel and 452: Mission.  Panel 2: Cueball tries to carry a lockpick set (a tool able to unlock doors without the original key) through security. The security guard tells Cueball that he has to come with him, but Cueball wants to tell the guard about ""this hacker girl"" before going with the guard. This may be spoofing the incidents where someone has been manipulated into smuggling drugs or other contraband by a romantic interest they met on the Internet. The hacker girl could be Elaine from the 1337-series.  Panel 3: On the plane, Cueball has been instructed to disable the wireless transmission functionality of his device. Many airlines require passengers to disable mobile phones on aircraft as well as other radio transmitting devices because they may interfere with the radio-based navigation and communication equipment of the aircraft. However, his laptop is running Linux and he doesn't know how to change the wireless settings; he's reading the manual for the program that controls the wireless radio. However, this is probably not the ideal situation, as the airplane is pressed to take off. Man page was also referenced in 293: RTFM. Much later a plane was again linked to a man page in 912: Manual Override.  Panel 4: Black Hat tries to carry a container of liquid through security. According to US law, the maximum amount of liquid that can be taken onto a plane in a container is three ounces, a security measure taken to prevent terrorists from taking explosives onto planes. When the guard has doubts about the amount of liquid in the vial, Black Hat implies that the liquid is actually blood from a churchmouse.  This is referred to later in 526: Converting to Metric, which claims that a fieldmouse has much less blood than that.  The guard is visibly uncomfortable and clearly does not want to deal with the issue any further.  The title text continues off the final panel, saying that there are less than three ounces of blood in a churchmouse, but it ""stains panties"", an undesirable scenario. However, this undesirable scenario is paralleled by the implied undesirable scenario of a terrorist attack due to explosive liquids, the possibility of which caused the law. The title text seems to parody the prospect of an explosion with the relatively insignificant staining of panties, a term for women's underwear. This may also be a menstruation joke.","[Standing outside the Airport. There is a sign saying ""Airport"" and a plane in the background.] Megan: Okay, what airline? Beret Guy: I'm following you. Megan: ...I'm following you. Beret Guy: I assumed we were walking to the bakery. Megan: You always assume that!  [Presumably the security checkpoint.] Security Guy: Lockpicks?

456: Cautionary,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/456:_Cautionary,computers,"This really is a true story, and she doesn't know I put it in my comic because her wifi hasn't worked for weeks.","Cueball's cousin decides to install Linux on her new PC, and calls Cueball, whom she views as her personal Linux expert. The overarching joke revolves around the fact that Linux, especially home PC-based GNU/Linux, is much more often used as a ""hobby"" OS, as compared against a ""productivity"" OS such as Windows or OS X. Large numbers of people use Windows or Mac by default, because it came with their computer hardware when they bought it, and it already had the software suite they wanted to use installed along with it. Linux, on the other hand, rarely comes pre-installed on PC hardware and generally must be deliberately chosen and acquired; and while it can be set up to achieve efficient and productive workflow in virtually any area on PCs, because it often must be consciously selected, installed, and configured by users, it tends to either attract or, in a few cases, create individuals who take disproportionate pleasure in, and derive self-identification from, hacking the operating system itself. Thus, many people who are Linux enthusiasts began by not really knowing anything about it other than that it's free of cost, but the process of actually building Linux on their machines gradually led them to take an increasing interest in it, which the comic humorously likens to substance addiction.  Xorg (officially X.Org) is an implementation of the X Window System, a program responsible for the graphical display used on Linux. If it has configuration problems, which was quite common with some video card drivers back in 2008 (especially those  for ATI Radeon cards), it is often difficult and/or painful to fix (see 963: X11). Man pages are manual pages for Unix-based operating systems and software, usually accessible online but also bundled with the software itself.  Considered helpful and clear by the sorts of advanced computer users who typically run Linux, the text only documentation requires a bit of a learning curve and not generally adequate for less-technical users.  Here the joke starts to build in that Cueball's friend, a computer novice who just wanted something to work out of the box, is now having to learn how to understand Linux documentation in order to even 'attempt' to fix her ongoing Xorg problem (likely an inability to start a graphical terminal, something a novice user would depend on).  In the third panel we see that the friend's problems are persisting.  She may have been able to get a graphical terminal to work, but now Ubuntu's built-in auto configuration tools are failing to 'address' another critical problem, and possibly getting in the way of fixes suggested in the previously mentioned man pages.  The friend suggests that she is considering a more ""advanced"" distribution in the hopes that they might offer some additional flexibility to fix the problem at hand. A Linux ""distribution"" is a suite of tools and applications that provide a specific user experience on top of the core Linux operating system. Each distribution, or ""distro"", has a different look and feel, and different feature sets and design philosophies. Ubuntu is a very popular ""beginner"" version of Linux, designed to ""just work"" and be familiar/usable to people fresh out of Windows. Debian is a popular but somewhat more ""advanced"", ""Unix-like, distro, that is nevertheless considered mainstream with a huge and diverse base of supported software that generally requires more Linux know-how to configure and use.  In fact Ubuntu is based on Debian and it would not be considered much of a leap for an Ubuntu user to switch.  Gentoo, on the other hand, is a very advanced distro allowing for extreme customization and optimization but requiring extensive install and setup time.  It is generally considered to be the most difficult form of Linux to use and is often joked about as being a form of technological masochism.  It appears that during her six weeks struggle to build her system, Cueball's friend has started to consider that her problem would require a solution that could only be accommodated by Gentoo.  In the fourth panel there is a strong implication that the friend has indeed switched to Gentoo because a hallmark of that distribution is the kernel (the basic core of the operating system) must be compiled from source code upon installation.  Source code is a computer program expressed in an somewhat human-readable format, often simply as text. However, source code cannot be run directly by a computer, and instead needs to be ""compiled"" into a low level machine instructions the computer can understand. This means that with Gentoo, instead of downloading an already functional Linux system to install and run, users download the source code for the system, customize it to their own needs, then compile the code into a runnable version of the OS, all before they can begin to use the system. The friend has been forced to do this because whatever her problem is, the solution required a customized kernel.  This could include needing the kernel to be compiled in a non-standard way not supported by more mainstream distros, incorporating experimental third party code into the kernel or modifying the kernel herself to fix the problem.  Compiling a kernel with the aforementioned modifications is a tricky affair since any mistake or oversight can render the kernel, and thus the computer, non-functional.  If a mistake is made or the custom kernel does not fix her problem  the kernel needs to be compiled anew.  The fourth panel also implies the friend has been stuck in a Trial and error loop, compiling the kernel over and over again for the better part of 6 weeks in an attempt to fix her problem.   To many such advanced users, their installation of Linux is like a hobby sportscar: A never-ending project, constantly tweaked and cleaned and adjusted to improve performance, that spends far more time sitting around with its hood open than actually being used for its ostensible purpose.  However, for more typical users who are interested in a functional computer system instead of a toy or project system, Linux can be highly frustrating, requiring far more time and effort just to bring the system to the point where they can use it for what they wanted to do all along.  By week 12, Cueball's friend is likely suffering from the Sunk cost fallacy, in that she believes that since she has put in so much time she needs to see it through.  She might also be optimistically underestimating how much additional work will be required since at each point Linux does at least offer potential solutions due to its customizability.  Finally there could be an element of Target fixation, in that the friend has become so focused on the problem, she has forgotten about her original plans for the computer or that Windows is still an option.   In the fifth panel, Randal riffs on the old anti-drug message ""Parents, talk to your kids about drugs before someone else does"", with the meaning being if a responsible adult does not educate their kids about the dangers of drugs (or Linux), then someone else (likely a peer) might convince them that drugs (or Linux) is a good idea.  This brings us to the overall theme of the comic in that Linux might 'seem' like a good idea for the average, less-technical user, but in reality will open up a world of pain that will hinder their ability to be a computationally functional member of society.  There is an additional call to the theory of gateway drugs where mild drugs like alcohol or cannabis will lead to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin.  In the comic, Cueball's friend starts out with Ubuntu, a ""gateway"" version of Linux.  However it quickly leads to harder and harder versions, all in a futile effort to solve her problem, with the end result being her vanishing for weeks inside her house like a junkie hopelessly hooked on drugs.   The title text continues the joke about Linux's poor support for many Wi-Fi cards common in 2008, a device that is not only well supported on Windows, but was typically seen as making networking easy for less technical users.  While the comic primarily pokes fun at the difficulties in using Linux (circa 2008), it indirectly shows some of the advantages.  The first one is that it is a freely available alternative to Windows and the second is that it provides users the tools to make fixing problems possible, whereas with Windows the only problems that are fixed are the ones Microsoft chooses to fix.  The comic is also somewhat anachronistic as over time hardware support in Linux has become much more robust.  It is currently unlikely that Cueball's friend would wind up in kernel compile hell to enable basic functions such as graphics and Wi-Fi.  The world's most popular operating system, Android, is a flavor of Linux and the growth of web-based applications have pushed much of even the desktop user experience into the browser.  As of 2017 it would be unlikely that the friend would even consider a desktop computer, instead relying on her Android phone or tablet.","Linux: A True Story: [Cueball talks on a cell phone.] Week One: Cousin: Hey, it's your cousin.

Cueball has created a patch that allows support for processors with 4,096 cores, even though most computers have only 8 cores or fewer. He considers this to be more worthwhile an endeavor than full-featured Flash support, which is much more commonly used. Flash movies are known for their bad performance and high consumption on CPU power compared with other movie formats. Cueball's friend is uninterested in the 4,096-core-processor fix, and only wants to know if it will help him with Flash video.  However, as of 2013, there are commercial computer systems that can be actually configured up to 2,048 cores (4,096 threads), e.g. SGI UV 2000. Linux powers 95% of the world's supercomputers, so while Flash video on desktop Linux would directly affect more people, the high performance computing industry relies on and actually funds Linux development. It should be noted that GNU/Linux now supports flash via Gnash. The first stable release was February 15, 2012; over two and a half years after this comic was written.  The title text mentions the ""American political satirist, writer, director, television host, actor, media critic, and stand-up comedian"" Jon Stewart which further refers to his famous American late night satirical television program The Daily Show. The show is also available on the internet (www.thedailyshow.com), presenting the shows on Flash videos.","Cueball: It took a lot of work, but this latest linux patch enables support for machines with 4,096 CPUs, up from the old limit of 1,024.

797: debian-main,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/797:_debian-main,computers,dpkg: error processing package (--purge): subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit 163: OH_GOD_THEYRE_INSIDE_MY_CLOTHES,"Debian is a Linux distribution most notable for introducing APT (Advanced Packaging Tool). APT is a tool that functions as an automated general software installer for Linux systems; all one has to do is tell it what software package they would like to install, and the program will automatically fetch the software and all of its dependencies (other packages that a program relies on, such as a library for processing ZIP archives) from a central repository. It will also automatically handle upgrades by automatically checking if the repository version of a package is higher than the currently installed version, and it can even handle the use of multiple repositories and linking between them; for example, if a piece of software is deemed worthy of inclusion in Debian's main repository, but as a stable release, the software developers can provide their own repository to provide a more experimental version for users who want it, and once that repository is added to APT's source list, APT will automatically realize that it should use the experimental version, since it has a higher version than that of the main repository. Although this wasn't the first package management system for easy Linux installation (that honor goes to RPM), it is the first one that seamlessly integrated online installation and upgrades into the mix.  debian-main is Debian's main repository, included by default in all Debian installations. It's what you might call the ""canon"" of Debian, containing only those packages that have been approved by official Debian developers. Thus, getting a package on debian-main means that it, theoretically, conforms to a standard of quality.  In this case, however, the Debian developers seem to have not noticed that one of the dependencies for the package is ""locusts."" Locusts are real insects, the migratory forms of several grasshopper species, that are best known for breeding extremely quickly, swarming, and devouring all green plant matter they come across, resulting in crop devastation (some consider this a plague). In some parts of the world they are also considered a delicacy. Cueball probably does not appreciate this as they crawl over his body searching for food, apparently spontaneously generated by APT as it saw that it needed ""locusts"" to install the package.  The title text is an error line from dpkg, the program used to install/remove APT packages. Every package contains several scripts (although some of them may be empty) that are run on various events related to that package; these are used to perform any setup/cleanup tasks the package needs. This line is an error line indicating that one of those scripts has failed. The relevant portions are:","AAAAAAAA [A swarm of insects cover Cueball and his computer.

824: Guest Week: Bill Amend (FoxTrot),http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/824:_Guest_Week:_Bill_Amend_(FoxTrot),computers,"Guest comic by Bill Amend of FoxTrot, an inspiration to all us nerdy-physics-majors-turned-cartoonists, of which there are an oddly large number.","Bill Amend, author of the newspaper comic FoxTrot, draws for Randall in this special 'Guest Week' edition of xkcd. In the first two panels, we see Jason Fox, a geeky 10-year-old from Amend's strip. Jason asks to draw comics for Randall. When Randall refuses, he uses the sudo command, used in POSIX systems to perform an action as an administrator/super user. This forces Randall to agree. This is a reference to the very popular comic 149: Sandwich, which has now become a geek culture catch-phrase.  In the first comic, Cueball is making a pun on the word attractive. In the first context it means a person is  ""good looking"" or ""beautiful"" which the (presumably) female character attributes to her hair. In Cueball's context, it means that he is feeling an increased gravitational pull from the woman, due to her increase in mass (see Gravitation). This setup is also very typical of the Jason Fox character, who, ostensibly ten, is supposed to be too young to like girls.  Werner Heisenberg postulated in 1927, his eponymous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which roughly states that in quantum mechanics one cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle. The joke is that (presumably) Elisabeth Heisenberg does not know the position of her keys, because she knows too much about their (the keys') momentum. (This is also the subject of 1473: Location Sharing.)  In many parliamentary and congressional halls it is customary, when calling an issue to vote to have the people who want the issue at hand to be passed to say out loud that they agree. The customary response to this is to say ""aye."" The dissenters are then asked. Their response would be ""nay"" or ""no"". Then the volume (by rough decibels) of the assenters and dissenters are weighed. If it is close, a more formal vote may be called. ""Aye"" is pronounced the same way as the letter ""i"" and ""i"" is the mathematical value of the square root of negative one, which can be used to represent an imaginary number.  The title text of this comic draws attention to the fact that there are a number of notable people who have become famous as cartoonists, but also hold degrees in physics or have a strong interest in physics. This might seem unusual, because the average person might see physics and art as incompatible, and this is why Randall writes ""an oddly large number.""

While Christmas is principally a Christian reimagining of a Pagan holiday, celebrating the birth of Jesus on December 25, there are many traditions around the holiday, among them a tradition that on Christmas Eve Santa Claus will make his round delivering gifts to good children.  Rob sits behind a Linux computer and tried to change his user account from his normal access to the access of a super user by using the command ""sudo su"". Sudo is a famous phrase in xkcd lore, made famous by comic 149: Sandwich. Before allowing administrator access (as root user), it asks for a password. The field is blank because, in most Linux systems, the characters of the password are not shown. When Rob is unable to use the command his account is not authorized and the system says that the incident ""will be reported"" (usually to the system administrator, so he can see if someone is making repeated attempts at accessing administrator privileges).  In the comic, however, sudo and the system report the incidents to Santa Claus, who, in Christmas lore, makes a list of who is naughty and who is nice. If you are nice then you get presents, while if you are naughty, you get a lump of coal. When sudo reports to Santa that Rob's account is not authorized, he puts Rob on the naughty list.  In the title text, which is a parody of the famous Christmas song, ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"", /var/spool/mail/root is the root (superuser) mailbox on a Linux system, where the incident described in the comic would commonly be reported to.","[Rob is sitting at a computer.

910: Permanence,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/910:_Permanence,computers,This hostname is going in dozens of remote config files. Changing a kid's name is comparatively easy!,"Choosing a name for a server is both an important and non-trivial task. It is non-trivial enough that there are official communications on how to choose a good name and why many ideas are bad, for example RFC 1178 Name Your Computer. It is important to pick a good name because changing it is costly once many reference to the existing name are widespread. For example, RFC 1178 states:  So Cueball wants to make sure that he chooses a great permanent name, that he can give to the server he is running.   When Megan quips on how quickly Cueball named their daughter Caroline (a living being - that is, the type of entity that would give the server purpose), Cueball retorts that he was under pressure at the time: Megan tried to name said daughter ""Epidural"" in honor of the painkiller drugs that were being injected into her spine at the time. Megan tries to justify this by explaining that those were very good drugs, but thus also confirms Cueball in that she was drugged, not in her right mind, and thus not making good decisions (despite epidurals working by stopping nerves in the spinal cord from transmitting signals, and would not have an affect on the brain seen in someone given an opiate or narcotic. She may, however, have been motivated purely by the fact that the drug stopped the pain of labor or a cesarean section).  In the title text Cueball mentions that he thinks that it is easier to change a person's name than to change the hostname of a server because of the number of changes that would need to be made to each of the machines that would have saved the old name of the server. It seems, however, that Cueball has never had to wait in line at the Social Security Administration office or at the Department of Motor Vehicles, as both of those events typically take excruciatingly long amounts of time. On the top panel is the sketch of a Debian Installer showing hostname dialog for its menu-driven frontend.","[A large panel the combined width of the four panels below it.] [A blue Linux terminal installer screen with a grey box that is labeled ""[!]CONFIGURE THE NETWORK"" in red.

912: Manual Override,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/912:_Manual_Override,computers,I think you mean 'GNU Info Override'.,"There are two jokes in this comic. The first is that the pilot typed ""man override"" to manually override the plane's computer and steer the plane to safety, but instead he ends up opening the manual page for ""OVERRIDE"". The second joke is making fun of a trend in documentation for Unix-like systems using the free GNU toolchain.  Historically, UNIX systems had a way to access descriptions of the available programs by using the ""man"" command (from ""manual""). Typing ""man [program name]"" would output a concise, helpful text, called a ""man page"", describing the program's functionality, available command-line options, a list of related programs, etc. For some GNU-based systems, however, the output of ""man [program name]"" will be entirely too brief, mainly telling what the program does, then directing the user to invoke a GNU-specific information system (GNU Info). GNU Info pages can be quite useful, e.g. they often contain much more information than man pages, and are hypertextual, allowing quick navigation through a network of content-related Info pages; however, they often are much more complex to search through than simple man files, which take the form of single scrollable pages, one per program.  As such, the humour is predicated upon understanding the frustration which sometimes arises when GNU/Linux users seek out a man page, hoping for an easy, digestible read, only to find that the man page they opened merely redirects them to another, less accessible network of hypertext Info pages. This can be especially annoying when it interrupts a person's workflow; e.g. when what they wanted was to spend three seconds looking up the proper format of a particular command line function, and instead they end up redirected to a maze of detailed documentation. To add injury to the insult, sometimes the Info pages aren't actually installed, causing the ""info"" viewer to just render the same old ""man"" page that had the directions in the first place.  The title text provides a tongue-in-cheek correction to the comic's title, suggesting that rather than typing ""man(ual) override"", the user/pilot should type ""info override"" to search GNU Info instead.","[A plane is in a nosedive with smoke pouring from one wing. Text comes from someone reading in the cockpit.] ""This is the emergency override system, which can be used to regain control of the aircraft. Complete instructions for activating this system are available as a GNU info page."""
156: Commented,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/156:_Commented,computers,Your IDE's color may vary.,"When Cueball asks Black Hat for a favor, he seems to be making a rude gesture, by lifting a finger towards Cueball. The word he says Commented! does, however, not seem to fit with the shorter four letter word usually combined with such a gesture.   Cueball also fails to understand this, but as it turns out, as the panels move around Black Hat and zooms in on his fingers, he is not making this rude gesture, but is instead actually lifting two fingers toward Cueball, forming a double slash and thereby ignoring both him and his question for a favor, by commenting him out programming style, even to the point where Black Hat sees the commenting out slashes, Cueball, and anything he says in the color for ignored parts of the program (or real world in this case).  In certain programming languages (including but not limited to C (since C99), C++, C#, Java, Javascript, PHP, and Scala), inserting a double slash (//) in a line marks everything after the double slash in the line as a ""comment,"" i.e. something for humans to read that generally helps them understand the code better, rather than something for the computer to execute. Since all comment lines are ignored when a program is run or compiled, it is possible to simply put a double slash in front of any line of code to skip that line. This is known as ""commenting out"" the line.  An Integrated Development Environment (IDE for short) is an application that programmers use to write, compile, execute, and debug code. Many IDEs color-code text to make reading the code easier. In IDEs like Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio, a line that is commented out will be colored green; however, the color may vary depending on which IDE you use, and can usually also be customized. The title text refers to this variation among IDEs' color schemes.","[Cueball calls out to and Black Hat while they are some distance apart as seen from the side. Black Hat is holding an arm out towards Cueball making a gesture and speaking one word.] Cueball: Hey, can you do me a favor? Black Hat: Commented!  [The same setting seen from behind Black Hat with Cueball drawn much smaller in the background.] Cueball: Huh?  [Black Hat's hand is shown in close up. He is holding his first and second fingers parallel and at an angle towards the ""small"" Cueball to the left of the hand. The two fingers, as well as Cueball and his next line, are green.] Cueball: Wait, what does that gesture even mean?"
163: Donald Knuth,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/163:_Donald_Knuth,computers,His books were kinda intimidating; rappelling down through his skylight seemed like the best option.,"Donald Knuth is a computer science Professor Emeritus at Stanford University who is famous for writing The Art of Computer Programming and developing the TeX computerized typesetting system.  An array in computer science is a structure that stores multiple values in a fixed order, and the elements are accessed by their index number.  In Pascal, for instance, one writes array[1] to access the first element in the array. Most ""modern"" (read: descended from C) languages use 0 as the index for the first element in the array, but it is possible (if one is careful about it) to ignore the 0th element and use 1 as the first index. In some programming languages (such as Ada) it is possible to select an arbitrary range of indices for each array type, so the first index might be not only 0 or 1 but even 100000. Cueball is complaining that Black Hat was not consistent in his choice of where to start his arrays. This is a valid complaint, as a lack of such consistency can make coding errors both more likely and less easy to detect.  Black Hat cites Donald Knuth to support his rebuttal, but the quote he uses does not seem relevant.  It turns out that Black Hat had illegally entered the professor's house in order to question him on indices. Donald Knuth's words were not an intellectual response to the question, but rather an alarmed response to the presence of an intruder.  It is not clear if Black Hat is aware of this.  The title text suggests that Black Hat finds Donald's books intimidating, due to perhaps their size or complexity, to the extent that he considers breaking into Donald's house (a risky, difficult crime) to be the better option in finding his answer. Even for Donald Knuth's books, this is very exaggerated and illogical behaviour.    🐸","[Black Hat and Cueball are sitting back to back at two separate desks, typing.] Cueball: Man, you're being inconsistent with your array indices. Some are from one, some are from zero. Black Hat: Different tasks call for different conventions. To quote Stanford algorithm's expert Donald Knuth, ""Who are you? How did you get in my house?"" Cueball: Wait, what? Black Hat: Well, that's what he said when I asked him about it."
217: e to the pi Minus pi,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/217:_e_to_the_pi_Minus_pi,computers,"Also, I hear the 4th root of (9^2 + 19^2/22) is pi.","e is a mathematical constant roughly equal to 2.71828182846. π is another, roughly equal to 3.14159265359. Both are transcendental numbers.  The first panel discusses eπ − π, which is around 19.999099979 — very close to 20.  Black Hat explains how he tricked a programming team into believing that eπ − π is close enough to 20 that the computer should be unable to tell the difference, and that any noticeable deviation from 20 results from errors in the code. This made them waste a lot of time trying to find a nonexistent bug until they realized that Black Hat was lying (clearly they had not known him for very long).  Floating point numbers are how computers store non-integer real numbers as decimals — or rather, in most cases, approximate them: infinite amounts of data would be required to represent most numbers in decimal form (exceptions are whole numbers and terminating decimals). The ""floating-point handlers"" would be the code performing the eπ − π calculation.  ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery, sponsoring the International Collegiate Programming Contest.  Some random facts about the math here:  The title text pokes fun at another coincidence: ∜(9² + 19²/22) ≈ 3.1415926525, close to π (deviating only in the 9th decimal place). The humor comes from the fact that π is transcendental. Transcendental numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed through basic arithmetic with integers; one cannot end up with the exact value for any transcendental number (including π) by adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, exponentiating, and/or taking the nth root of any whole number, meaning the title text cannot possibly be true.  A much later comic, 1047: Approximations, puts forth quite a few more mathematical coincidences.","Cueball: Hey, check it out: eπ − π is 19.999099979. That's weird. Black Hat: Yeah. That's how I got kicked out of the ACM in college. Cueball: ...what? Black Hat: During a competition, I told the programmers on our team that eπ − π was a standard test of floating-point handlers -- it would come out to 20 unless they had rounding errors. Cueball: That's awful. Black Hat: Yeah, they dug through half their algorithms looking for the bug before they figured it out."
292: goto,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/292:_goto,computers,Neal Stephenson thinks it's cute to name his labels 'dengo',"Goto is a construct found in many computer languages that causes control flow to go from one place in program to another, without returning. Once common in computer programming, its popularity diminished in the 1960s and 1970s as focus on structured programming became the norm. Edsger W. Dijkstra's article ""Go To Statement Considered Harmful"" in particular contributed to the decline of goto.  Often people learning programming are told goto is bad and should be avoided, but frequently are not given a reason. In this case, Cueball can see no harm in using goto to avoid rewriting much of his program. As a result, he is attacked by a velociraptor. Velociraptor attacks are a running joke (and fear) often expressed in xkcd. The humor derives from the fact that a velociraptor attack is an unexpected and severe consequence of using a goto statement.  The title text refers to Neal Stephenson, an author of cyberpunk novels. A label is used in many programming languages to refer to a point in a program that a goto instruction can jump to. The joke is that one of Stephenson's characters in Cryptonomicon is named Goto Dengo... when said out loud, ""Dengo"" sounds like ""Then go"".  Like all velociraptors in xkcd, the velociraptor in this comic is specifically the man-sized movie monster from Jurassic Park.  Real velociraptors were more like carnivorous turkeys.  The beast devouring Cueball might actually be Deinonychus antirrhopus.","[Cueball sits at computer, thinking.] Cueball: I could restructure the program's flow - or use one little 'GOTO' instead. Cueball: Eh, screw good practice. How bad can it be? Text on computer: goto main_sub3; *Compile* [Cueball looks at the computer.] [A raptor jumps into the panel and attacks Cueball.]"
303: Compiling,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/303:_Compiling,computers,"Are you stealing those LCDs?' 'Yeah, but I'm doing it while my code compiles.'","Computer programming involves writing instructions for a computer to follow, in a specific programming language, which is largely human readable and writable, at least to programmers who understand that language.  However, for the computers to follow instructions, they need to be given machine code — the actual ""language"" that computers ""speak"" and one that can be written directly with the correct tools, but would be too tedious and error-prone for just about any practical modern project where alternatives exist, where anything more than a Hello World could be awkward to implement straight into machine-code.  Conversion from the more conveniently human-writable code into computer-executable files is performed by interpreters or compilers.  Interpreters (e.g. that for PHP for one example) generally read through the code, or script, each line at a time as and when required, and has to do a lot of work with various processing overheads and the risk of hitting an invalid instruction or mistake in syntax that it can't handle.  It also requires that a relevant version of the interpreter exist on any machine that has to run the script and perhaps some additional knowledge by the end-user.  For widely distributed (and especially commercial) programs, some form of compilation will instead be used.  Compiling may have just one computer system read through the man-written code and (barring errors) produces the equivalent stand-alone and direct machine-readable code, suitable for a given range of computers.  This process might involve several passes to check for 'obvious' errors in the code, as well as converting some programming concepts that are easiest for humans to understand into equivalent concepts that may be far easier for the computer to work with.  As such, compiling takes a certain amount of time at the time of production.  Depending on the size of the project and the power of the computer doing the compilation, it may measure in hours, but at least only needs to be repeated if an untrapped error needs fixing or additional features added in at a later date.  As of 2015 the Linux Kernel contains over 19 million lines of code, arguably a massive job for any compiler, but if done correctly it saves time for all the people who will ultimately be using its output.  Thus, when Cueball is caught wasting time at work, he argues that such activities are not worse than any other possible ones, at this moment.  If his job is writing code and compiling it, then there may be nothing else that he can do right now.  He cannot usefully tweak the code before it finishes compiling and the expected result checked.  The title text takes this a step further.  Cueball claims that all activities are equally benign while the code is compiling — and that includes committing illegal acts, such as stealing LCDs.  Nine years after this comic was released Randall made a comic called 1755: Old Days about how compiling worked in the old days. It was Cueball who asked. The next comic after that, 1756: I'm With Her, was released the Monday before the 2016 United States presidential election. And in that comic a Cueball with a sword on an office chair like in this comic is featured. Seems realistic that Randall had that politically loaded comic ready for some time, and when finding and deciding to use this old version of Cueball, he may have gotten inspired by the compiling theme to make Old Days.","The #1 Programmer Excuse for Legitimately Slacking Off: ""My code's compiling."" [Two programmers are sword-fighting on office chairs in a hallway. An unseen manager calls them back to work through an open office door.] Manager: Hey! Get back to work! Cueball: Compiling! Manager: Oh. Carry on."
312: With Apologies to Robert Frost,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/312:_With_Apologies_to_Robert_Frost,computers,Some say the world will end in fire; some say in segfaults.,"This comic presents a poem about a god's dilemma of whether to create the world using Perl or Lisp, two popular computer programming languages. The god has chosen to write it in Perl but since then appears to lament the choice, apparently expressing that if given the chance to write the world's code again, he or she or it would use Lisp instead.  The implication is that a universe created by Lisp would look better under close examination, the 'founding myth' referred to in the poem.  Instead of an incomprehensible big bang, inflation, dark matter and dark energy, the elegance of Lisp may have led to more elegantly framed laws of nature.  The grammar of Lisp as a language requires the programmer to use a multitude of parentheses, and in many cases it can be difficult to determine whether all of the parentheses have been properly matched up to one another. The last two lines of the poem refer to the plentiful parentheses in Lisp, and the image at the bottom of the panel shows a close-parenthesis at the supposed end of the Universe.  A segmentation fault, also commonly called a segfault, is an error that occurs when a computer program attempts to access computer memory to which it should not have access.  This is a fatal error that will cause the program to stop executing.  This comic deals with similar subject matter to 224: Lisp, in which one of ""the gods"" claims that although the Universe may appear to have been written in Lisp, it was actually written mostly using Perl.  The poem itself and the title text are a parody of ""Fire and Ice,"" written by the American poet Robert Frost and first published in 1920. In this poem, the speaker discusses his stance in the debate on whether the world will be destroyed in fire or in ice. ""A God's Lament"" has a rhyme scheme that is nearly identical to that of Frost's poem. However, it differs in that ""Lisp"" does not rhyme with ""men,"" ""again,"" and ""paren,"" while the corresponding four lines in Frost's poem do rhyme.","A God's Lament Some said the world should be in Perl; Some said in Lisp. Now, having given both a whirl, I held with those who favored Perl. But I fear we passed to men A disappointing founding myth, And should we write it all again, I'd end it with A close-paren.  )"
323: Ballmer Peak,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/323:_Ballmer_Peak,computers,Apple uses automated schnapps IVs.,"This comic is about alcohol and programming ability. Programmers sometimes have a reputation for drinking habits, and programmer gatherings (such as hackfests) tend to offer copious amounts of alcohol. More generally, intoxicated programmers can get the impression that, by being a little disconnected from physical reality, they become more efficient at their programming. The comic is a take on this belief, with two references:  The curve in the comic suggests that, while generally decreasing with alcohol intoxication, at just the right level the skill of a programmer gets terrific indeed. Randall named the peak after Steve Ballmer, as if discovered by him; this references the analogously named Balmer peaks (with one 'L'), and the idea that Steve Ballmer makes for an easy association of programming and alcohol. The peak of the curve occurs at a BAC of 0.1337%, which is a reference to leet. (See this interview with Randall).  The end of the comic turns the whole idea into a sideways jab at Windows ME, a version of Microsoft Windows often criticized for being buggy, slow and unstable: it suggests that ME was developed by programmers completely drunk, because their managers wanted to exploit this ""Ballmer peak"", but did so without any precaution. That idea fit well the result of a buggy and unstable product.  On the contrary, the title text claims that Apple uses this effect with careful calibration, by delivering precise quantities of alcohol (schnapps) to its programmers via intravenous therapy (IV).  An actual research paper published in March 2012 showed that the situation described in this comic is not far from reality. Researchers found that intoxicated participants performed better than sober participants on a test that evaluates creative problem solving skills, and were also more likely to evaluate their own solutions as insightful. However, the actual reported peak was 0.075%, not between 0.129% and 0.138% as displayed in the comic.  In the above-mentioned speech at Google, Randall Munroe explained that he tried to experiment on himself about the relationship between alcohol intoxication and intellectual skills, by solving a Rubik's Cube repeatedly while getting more and more drunk. He eventually found that he could get deeply drunk without degrading very much his performance at solving the puzzle (contrary to, for instance, finding and picking up the Cube which became something of a problem towards the end). He suggested that the Rubik's Cube wasn't a good test to study this relationship, the cube probably being solved with muscle memory rather than real intellectual skills.","[A graph with ""programming skill"" on the Y-axis and ""blood alcohol concentration"" on the X one.] [Cueball is making a presentation with the graph.] Cueball: Called the Ballmer Peak, it was discovered by Microsoft in the 80's. The cause is unknown but somehow a B.A.C between 0.129% and 0.138% confers superhuman programming ability. Cueball: However, it's a delicate effect requiring careful calibration – you can't just give a team of coders a year's supply of whiskey and tell them to get cracking. Spectator: ...Has that ever happened? Cueball: Remember Windows ME? Spectator: I knew it!"
353: Python,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/353:_Python,computers,"I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday. It was wonderful. Perl, I'm leaving you.","Python is a programming language designed specifically to make it easy to write clear, readable programs. Flying is often used as a metaphor for freedom and ease, and here Randall shows Cueball literally flying in response to using Python.  A ""Hello, World!"" program is a very simple program that prints the phrase ""Hello, World!"", used in textbooks to illustrate a given programming language. While this sounds simple, it can be nontrivial in some programming languages where you need to explicitly import a library that contains the print function (for instance, in C you need to begin with #include <stdio.h>) or do complicated things with classes and variables (see the Java ""Hello, World!"" for one example). Python doesn't need any of that: print ""Hello, world!"" (or in Python 3.0, print(""Hello, world!"")) really is all you need to do.  Dynamic typing and significant whitespace are two controversial features of Python, which make some people—like Cueball's friend—hesitant to use the language.  Dynamic typing means that variables do not have types (like ""list of short integers"" or ""a bunch of letters""); any value of any type can be placed in any variable. Dynamic typing allows for more flexible languages, but it means that certain kinds of errors (like trying to subtract a letter from a number) can't be caught until a program is run, and some people think this is too dangerous for the tradeoff to be acceptable.  Whitespace is a string of invisible text characters, like spaces or tabs. In programming, blocks of code controlled by a statement are usually indented under that statement. Most languages require you to use braces ({…}) or special keywords (BEGIN…END) to delimit these blocks; in Python, the indentation itself is the delimiter. Many Python programmers find that this makes code more readable, but many other programmers find it too ""magical"" and don't trust it.  Classes, functions and constants in Python are packed into modules. To use a module, you write ""import module"" at the top of your source file. Python comes with a very powerful standard library of modules to do everything from parsing XML to comparing two sets of files for differences, and new modules can be easily installed from the PyPI repository, which has more than 79,000 more to choose from (as of April 2016). Cueball can fly because he imported the antigravity module. Python still works for Cueball in 482: Height.  In the final panel, Cueball admits that his ability to fly may actually be because he has ""sampled everything in the medicine cabinet"", though he's sure it is the Python anyway. An implication of this is that ingesting everything in the medicine cabinet has given him the feeling of freedom and ease that ""flying"" represents - or that he is hallucinating himself flying and having a conversation with the other character about it. Here, the metaphor of ""feeling like you're flying"" while using Python is transformed back from being literal (Cueball is actually flying) to being metaphorical (Randall feels like he is flying because Python is so easy to use... or because he had too many strange drugs).  Perl, mentioned in the title text, is another programming language with the same target audience as Python, as both are high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. However they strongly oppose each other in their language design:  Since he has discovered Python Randall doesn't like Perl anymore, probably because its syntax is less consistent.","[A Friend is talking to Cueball, who is floating in the sky.] Friend: You're flying! How? Cueball: Python! Cueball: I learned it last night! Everything is so simple! Cueball: Hello world is just 'print ""Hello, World!""' Friend: I dunno... Dynamic typing? Whitespace? Cueball: Come join us! Programming is fun again! It's a whole new world up here! Friend: But how are you flying? Cueball: I just typed 'import antigravity' Friend: That's it? Cueball: ...I also sampled everything in the medicine cabinet for comparison. Cueball: But I think this is the python."
379: Forgetting,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/379:_Forgetting,computers,"Of course, the assert doesn't work.","Cueball is writing a piece of code (probably in the programming language C++) which removes an item from a data structure called a Linked list (the first two lines of the text). Then, he writes a comment (which is delimited by the double slashes) relating the code to his personal life. Finally, he adds an assertion, which is normally a formal specification of a condition which should always be true (with which the programmer ensures that e.g. mass is not negative). But in this case, instead of asserting a software-related predicate, he asserts that ""it's going to be okay"" - and because of how string literals are treated by the interpreter, the assertion will be true.  An ""assert"" is a programming statement that allows you to insert sanity checks into your code. For example, if you were writing a program to calculate the speed of a neutrino, then at the end of the calculation you could say:    If the assertion fails, then the program will stop with an error. This would be much better than publishing an embarrassing paper, for example.   As stated previously, Cueball is removing an item from a linked list. This will essentially delete, or make the computer ""forget"" about the item. Cueball realizes that he cannot forget this emotional event through the use of two commands as he can with a computer, which only makes him feel depressed about an unsaid event, the item -- in a sense -- which cannot be removed.   He writes two comments further clarifying his sense of hopelessness over this event, followed by an assertion that ""it will be okay"", something which has nothing to do with the code he is writing.  The title text explains that assertion in question fails: we cannot be sure that things are going to be ok.","[Cueball sits at computer, coding.]  Cueball: <sniff>  [Cueball lowers his head into his hands and cries.]  [Cueball types again.]"
407: Cheap GPS,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/407:_Cheap_GPS,computers,"In lieu of mapping software, I once wrote a Perl program which, given a USB GPS receiver and a destination, printed 'LEFT' 'RIGHT' OR 'STRAIGHT' based on my heading.","GPS is a system allowing people to find their location and speed on Earth. It was first developed for the U.S. military, but now it sees international usage for everyday navigation. Many motorists today have GPS devices (sometimes just called GPS's) that can give driving directions electronically.  ""Hot and Cold"" is a children's activity/game where one person searches for an object they don't know what it is, and the rest must respond ""Hot"" or ""Cold."" Other words, such as ""warm"" and ""cool"" can be used to describe their distance more accurately. The closer the player is to the mystery, the ""hotter"" they are.  The series of instructions spoken (""cold"", ""warm"", ""hot"", then ""cold"" again) suggests that Cueball either missed a turn, or that he just passed his destination.  Randall describes a past engineering project of his that can only describe turns ""as the crow flies."" So, for example, if he was driving north with the destination to the northeast, the GPS would tell him to turn right even if no such turn was legally possible. Perhaps not very functional, but it is a pretty cool thing to build.","[Cueball driving down the road, with a GPS reading ""COLD"".] GPS: COLD... WARM... HOT! COLD..."
409: Electric Skateboard (Double Comic),http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/409:_Electric_Skateboard_(Double_Comic),computers,"Unsafe vehicles, hills, and philosophy go hand in hand.","This comic is an affectionate parody of Calvin and Hobbes, a newspaper comic drawn by Bill Watterson that ran for ten years from November 1985 to December 1995. Calvin and Hobbes follows the daily life of a rambunctious, precocious six-year-old named Calvin and his sarcastic stuffed tiger Hobbes. The artwork in the second strip is distinctly Wattersonian as well. This comic could be referencing the typical Sunday strip format of having a top line of ""throwaway panels"" that had a one-off gag before the rest of the strip, which was more detailed. This was an effect of Sunday strip formatting in newspapers, where individual newspaper often lopped off the the top one-third of the comic to save space. Thus, strip creators had to use the top panels on throwaway gags or else the readers of a space-saving newspaper would be missing key parts of the strip.  Calvin and Hobbes is also referenced in 529: Sledding Discussion.  Randall has a special fascination with motorized skateboards. A longboard is a skateboard that is longer, and is used for downhill races, and skating through less urban areas (college campuses, for example).  Mario Kart is a game for Nintendo game consoles that allows four players to race each other while having good spirited fun like at 290: Fucking Blue Shells while throwing items at each other. The objects in the fourth panel are Koopa Troopa shells, items in the game. They can be thrown like projectiles to crash into foes, green in a straight line, red homing onto racer in front.  Calvin and Hobbes frequently involves heavy philosophical discussions. In one recurring theme, they ride down a dangerous hill in a red wagon or tobbogan while discussing the nature of morality, usually ending in a crash (examples [1] [2] [3]). This comic inverts that by having Cueball and Megan go uphill while discussing philosophy. Naturally, they collide with Calvin and Hobbes' wagon - which prompts the title text.  Cueball uses the C and Python programming languages as analogies for their ride. In general, Python is easier than C, and abstracts a lot of C's hairier features (""boring parts,"" as Randall calls them). Moving from C to Python is quite a freeing experience; programmers no longer have to worry about pointers, and memory allocation, and just lets the code flow through the programmer until they are one with the Force. Erm, computer. Although it seems - before the crash - that the idea that, programming in C (and skating without electricity) builds character, is about to be explored philosophically (building character is also a recurring theme in Calvin and Hobbes, as documented delightfully in the Calvin and Hobbes wiki).  Electric skateboards have been the subject of several other comics like 139: I Have Owned Two Electric Skateboards, a panel in 442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel and the entire The Race five part comic series.","[Cueball showing off electric skateboard to girl reading something.] Cueball: Check it out!

413: New Pet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/413:_New_Pet,computers,ONE LAPTOP PER HAMSTER!,"Megan and Cueball create a new pet by putting an Eee PC into a hamster ball, allowing it to roll around.  The Asus Eee PC was one of the first subnotebook computers available on the American market, noted for its small size and coming pre-installed with Linux. With a diagonal size of 11 inches, it would take a big hamster ball to carry it like this.  Omniwheels are wheels with rollers mounted on the edge to allow the wheel to slide sideways. The wheels in the drawing look more like Mecanum wheels, which have rollers mounted at an angle to the edge. Both Omniwheels and Mecanum wheels are used in omni-directional drive systems, like you would use to drive a hamster ball from the inside. A webcam is connected magnetically to the top of the hamster ball, which connects to an rf link to transmit wirelessly to the computer.  TCO is total cost of ownership, which is exactly what it sounds like: the purchase price of something, plus all costs of keeping, operating, and/or maintaining that something. It's used in accounting to determine something's true cost-to-value evaluation. In the case of a cat, TCO would primarily consist of food, litter, veterinary care, etc. Refer to trivia for more details. For the device in the comic, there would be a small ongoing cost (occasional recharges for the batteries) after the initial investment.  A Roomba is a self-directed robotic vacuum cleaner made by iRobot.  Python is a programming language popular among geeks running Linux. Among other features, it has a large number of easily installed 3rd-party libraries which make it easy to add features to programs. In this case, Cueball is importing the ""soul"" library to give the new pet a soul – obviously something that a programming language cannot actually do. This is a reference to 353: Python.  The title text refers to the One Laptop per Child project spearheaded by Nicholas Negroponte around 2005, with the goal of building an inexpensive, durable sublaptop that could be distributed to children in developing countries to give them an educational edge.","[Megan is placing EEE PC inside hamster ball. Cueball scratches head.] Cueball: What are you doing? Megan: Mounting your EEE PC in a hamster ball.  Megan: Well, the TCO of a cat is like $1000/year, so we're saving money.

482: Height,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/482:_Height,computers,"Interestingly, on a true vertical log plot, I think the Eiffel Tower's sides would really be straight lines.","Height uses a logarithmic scale to depict the contents of the universe at progressively smaller distances from Earth (less high above the Earth), starting at the highest possible ""point"", the edge of the observable universe, going all the way down to the grass beneath our feet. The comic is a direct companion piece to 485: Depth, also released on a Monday the week after this one. Depth similarly uses the logarithmic scale to depict the Earth at progressively greater magnification (going ""deeper"" down), from Earth's surface (the grass) to the interior of a single proton. At the very top the top (edge) of the observable universe is described as being 46 billion light years above the Earth. The universe is ""only"" about 13.8 billion years old, so the cosmic background radiation that reaches the Earth today, has also only traveled 13.8 billion light years. However, during that time the universe has expanded, so the galaxies that formed from that spot where this background radiation was emitted 13.8 billion years ago, would now be 46 billion light years away. This has lead to many misconceptions regarding the size the most typical being that the radius of the observable universe is ""only"" 13.8 billion light years. See this video, How Do You Measure the Size of the Universe? for a great explanation of the 46 billion light years. To the right of the text, Black Hat stands atop the comic, having just dropped a cat off the edge head first; he is clearly going to test if the cat will land on its feet, being a jerk per his usual character. It will take some time though, before the cat reaches Earth... As one scrolls down, the depicted distances become less compressed, until arriving at the surface of Earth, all the while approaching a 1:1 scale with real-life distances. As shown in 1162: Log Scale, if Randall didn't do this, the comic would be much, MUCH longer. In this comic, most objects that are grounded on Earth are scaled logarithmically on the vertical axes and linearly on the horizontal axes (some are scaled linearly on both axes). Displaying objects in this manner noticeably distorts their shape; the Great Pyramid, for instance, looks not like a pyramid but like a bullet. Outside of the Earth's atmosphere, the objects are placed at their actual distances from Earth on the log scale, but their shapes are not subjected to the logarithmic scaling of Earth objects, instead appearing as they would be seen (otherwise, round objects like the sun would appear more egg shaped, with the flatter side facing upward). However, objects are still much larger or much smaller than they would be in real life, in order to allow them to be properly seen. In the title text, Randall muses on how the inwardly-curved sides of the Eiffel Tower might actually become perfectly straightened when subjected to this logarithmic distortion, although it is shown to bulge in the comic proper, meaning Randall probably doesn't fully believe his own musings. The actual shape of the Tower approximates an exponential curve, which would indeed give a straight line on a log scale, although it was actually designed by Gustave Eiffel to minimize wind resistance rather than to be mathematically exact (the design is so perfect that the amount the Tower sways in the wind is less than the amount it is distorted due to thermal expansion of the sunlit side).

505: A Bunch of Rocks,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/505:_A_Bunch_of_Rocks,computers,I call Rule 34 on Wolfram's Rule 34.,"Cueball awakens to find himself trapped for eternity in an endless expanse of sand and rocks. At first, he uses this time to derive all of mathematics and physics, including quantum mechanics and general relativity. Next Cueball creates a computer that can process any possible function, out of rocks and rules for the interaction between rocks. He then simulates a particle followed by the interactions between particles, followed by the entire universe. The amount of time it takes to simulate the change in the universe from one instant to the next takes an extremely long time as the time it takes to update just one row of rocks can be measured in googols of years, assuming a realistic time to place each rock.  Cueball then apologizes for any flaws we see in the simulation. This implies that the audience is living in Cueball's simulation, making Cueball essentially God.  The final frame cuts to a classroom where a bored student stares at his hands waiting for class to end. Cueball admonishes the student for thinking that class is lasting forever. The joke being that the boredom felt in a classroom is nothing compared to the boredom that inspires Cueball to spend his time toiling to keep the universe moving. Indeed, the minutes of lecture actually took many ""billions and billions of millennia"" for Cueball to simulate.  The title text suggests that Rule 34 should be called on Wolfram's Rule 34. Rule 34 (see 305: Rule 34) is a humorous rule of the Internet which states ""If you can imagine it, there is porn of it. No exceptions."" Wolfram's Rule 34 is a cellular automaton. Therefore, the title text says that someone has made pornography featuring the cellular automaton in question.  The three diagrams in the ""Physics, too. I worked out the kinks..."" panel are, from left to right:  The graph that represents particle interaction is a Feynman Diagram. This shows the interaction of subatomic particles that collide and exchange some momentum via a photon. The slope of the middle line represents the distance moved and the time lost/gained during the interaction.  The Swiss patent office line refers to Albert Einstein, who was employed as a Swiss patent clerk while coming up with his theory of special relativity. This joke is also referenced in 1067: Pressures.  Also, there is a standing joke that very few important inventions have come from Switzerland, since the country hadn't been involved in the world wars, and thus has not been part of the weapons race, nor was it a driving force in the preceding Industrial Revolution.  In the center of the comic, the binary numbers pointing to the particle are both 42. This is a reference to the comedic answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything from the The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.  Cueball mentions that if we see an artifact flutter in and out of reality he must have made a mistake in the last ""billions and billions of millennia.""  This implies that the small period of time the artifact is present in his time is much longer than our universe has existed. That is a very long time. However, because it was a really long time, the difference would be more than just a small mote of dust disappearing.  Cueball uses the rocks to build a cellular automaton, a computational model based on simple rules to advance from one state to the next. Certain cellular automata are Turing-complete, which means that they can be used to represent any conceivable algorithm if expanded infinitely. He specifically seems to be running Wolfram's Rule 110, which is capable of universal computation. When using Rule 110 for universal computation, one builds a background pattern, which can be seen in the comic as the pattern of smaller triangles, and then performs computation by sending out ""rockets"" to collide and interact with each other.","[Cueball is standing in a desert with lots of rocks lying around.

519: 11th Grade,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/519:_11th_Grade,computers,And the ten minutes striking up a conversation with that strange kid in homeroom sometimes matters more than every other part of high school combined.,"This strip is a comparison about the time spent in 11th grade doing various things, and how important those things are to one's future. The first two bars on the chart are 900 hours of class, which is about 180 hours short of how many hours kids spend in school each year (most likely to show the lunch hour), and 400 hours of homework, or an average of about 2.2 hours per school day. Conversely, idly messing around in Perl (a programming language) for only one weekend is shown to have a much larger impact on one's future — specifically Randall's, as learning how to code would have been key to his job as a robotics engineer at NASA. This is likely due to the skills one can pick up in even just a single weekend in contrast to the often redundant, trivial or generalist information that schools tend to convey. Having teachings in school end up not being useful in future is also topic on 1050: Forgot Algebra although there Randall conveys that it is normal and not an excuse to boast about one's ignorance.  The title text is a further exaggeration, claiming that striking up a conversation with the strange kid at school could be far more important than all four years of a high school education.  There is always the chance that ""that strange kid"" might turn out to be the next Mark Zuckerberg. Or that he knows a guy who can find you your first job.

521: 2008 Christmas Special,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/521:_2008_Christmas_Special,computers,How could you possibly think typing 'import skynet' was a good idea?',"This comic is the xkcd Christmas Special from the year 2008. The prologue states that due to the 2008 financial crisis, only very few images of the strip could be produced, leaving the others to be blacked out. It is therefore left to the reader to reconstruct the whole story based on the given images. While it is claimed that the reconstruction should be rather easy, the complicated and abstruse plot-line makes it nearly impossible to fill the gaps. Any attempt at inferring the missing images would therefore be largely guesswork. The comic features the well-known xkcd characters getting involved in a strange fight with cyborgs and raptors on Christmas Eve.  The line ""We apologize for the inconvenience."" is possibly a reference to the famous book series The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams. It appears there as God's Final Message to His Creation, written in letters of fire on the side of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains.  Panel 2: Megan strives to outdo some Christmas lights she has seen on YouTube.  Panel 3: Dissatisfied with her work, Megan is thinking about alternative ways improve her light arrangement. The idea of firing Sodium pellets into snow is probably a bad one, as Sodium reacts exothermically with water and may, in large amounts, induce explosions.  Panel 5: Probably still obsessed with the idea of creating a large and impressive light display, Megan has constructed an electronic device with an Arduino processor, perhaps to make the light chain show patterns. However, the amount of energy she used was apparently too high, causing one of the control boards to sublimate- go directly from a solid to a gaseous state without an intermediate liquid phase. She then wishes she could make the system self-repairing.  Panel 7: Megan's device has developed artificial intelligence, allowing it to feel. This is presumably a result of Megan attempting to make the device self-repairing. This common trope in science-fiction works usually leads to the system's attempting to eradicate its creator. Cueball attributes the emergence of a personality to awesome ease and power of programming in Python.  Panel 11: Out of context, this panel introduces the idea of Santa Claus being a Muslim. This may be a reference to the persistent Internet rumors that Barack Obama is a Muslim, though he declares himself to be a Christian. However, the statement could also relate to the fact the Santa Claus is usually displayed with a large beard, which is sometimes also sported by conservative Muslims.  Or it could just be non-sensical.  Panel 13: At this point the self-aware Christmas light control systems has apparently released cyborgs that tried to kill Megan and Cueball. In order to repel the cyborgs, they have cloned Velociraptors. Cueball expresses doubt whether that was really a good idea. Velociraptors appear frequently in xkcd, cf. comics 87, 135 and 292.  Panel 17: As predicted, the raptors have gone wild, but Megan, Cueball and the two smaller characters (perhaps their children) managed to cage the dinosaurs. They believe themselves safe unless the raptors learn how to build lightsabers. This is a reference to a line in Jurrasic Park where the main characters believe themselves safe, unless the raptors can learn how to open doors.  Panel 19: The raptors have indeed succeeded with constructing lightsabers and must now be fought. The ""Clever girl"" is a reference to a line from Jurassic Park where the raptors outflank (and kill) one of the human characters wearing a similar hat.  Panel 23: IT billionaire Bill Gates has mistakenly killed Santa Claus, possibly in a sword fight. He claims to have mistaken him for Richard Stallman, a prominent free software activist. (Gates strongly opposes the idea of free software and is therefore considered an antagonist by many of its supporters.) The most striking resemblance between Stallman and Santa Claus is probably the long and untamed beard. Comic 225 is one of the most famous xkcd comics and features Stallman involved in a sword fight.  Panel 29: Megan asks Black Hat where he obtained the enormously large christmas tree that can be seen on the right side of the picture. It is implied that he logged Yggdrasil, a giant ash tree in Norse mythology. According to tradition, Yggdrasil is the world tree representing the whole of creation and holding together the cosmological structure.  Panel 31: Randall wishes Merry Christmas to all xkcd readers.  The title text refers to panel 7. In Python, modules are imported using the ""import module"" syntax. Skynet is a self-aware artificial intelligence system featured in the Terminator film series as the main antagonist. Importing the skynet module might therefore account for Megan's system's developing an evil personality.  Note that this comic was first published in another version that had panel 29 as panel 27 and the ""Merry Christmas from xkcd"" message at the bottom. As 27 is not a prime number, the current version was published in lieu of the erroneous one.  It has been observed that the top left nine panels form a Glider in Conway's Game of Life. The glider is sometimes used as an emblem representing hacker subculture, although rotated by 90 degrees. It remains however unclear whether the occurrence in the comic is intentional or owed to the prime number pattern.","The 2008 XKCD Christmas Special Due to the slowing economy, we could only afford to produce the prime-numbered panels.

554: Not Enough Work,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/554:_Not_Enough_Work,computers,It's even harder if you're an asshole who pronounces <> brackets.,"In some companies, programmers can find themselves under-employed. This may be because these companies have little programming work until something breaks or needs upgrading, or perhaps they are between projects, or simply waiting for a go-ahead.  Coders still need to make themselves available to perform emergency fixes, but they may have no other assigned work. This requires them to find constructive ways to spend their time.  Or unconstructive, if that is more fun.  Dvorak is a keyboard layout that was proposed in 1936 as an alternative to the existing, entrenched QWERTY layout, developed in the 1870s. The QWERTY keyboard is the standard in the US, but some features in its layout are  based on mechanical considerations rather than the optimum placement for typing speed. For example, common letter combinations such as 'st' and 'th' had to be arranged so that their operating levers were separated from each other, lest they cause jams and slow down the typist. More than sixty years later, such mechanical considerations could be overcome, and Dvorak designed his keyboard layout with typing efficiency in mind.  The Dvorak keyboard was ultimately unsuccessful. It still persists today, but has never threatened the dominance of the QWERTY keyboard.  Even if the Dvorak layout is  more efficient (which is still a matter for debate, see the uncomfortable truth in 561: Well), QWERTY was and is the standard. This means that every keyboard user has to learn QWERTY anyway, and there is insufficient benefit in spending the time to learn a new layout, especially when you would have to switch back and forth between Dvorak and QWERTY as the situation demands.  Therefore, even seriously considering the switch is a sign that you really have nothing better to do.  Another joke is that even though the coder has plenty of spare time on his hands to practice on Dvorak, he has only been able to 'almost' match his old typing speed.  This was the first comic to refer to Dvorak, but since then it has become a recurrent theme on xkcd. A later comic, 1445: Efficiency, mentions, in the title text, how you could waste lots of time testing to see if Dvorak is faster.  Gopher is a defunct internet protocol, which has been completely superseded by HTTP. It's a perfect example of the kind of thing a programmer might implement in the absence of other, more useful work. (As an aside, the protocol is named for the mascot of the University of Minnesota, where it was developed.)  HTML and XHTML are markup languages used to describe web documents. XHTML-strict is a more restricted version of HTML that excludes certain redundant tags like <center>, which is theoretically no longer necessary now that <div> and <span> exist. Haiku, on the other hand, is a kind of Japanese poetry. Rather than having a rhyming meter like Western poetry, Japanese poetry has strict restrictions on syllable count; a haiku must contain three lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables, respectively. The section of code given is HTML markup, and would be read by a web developer like this:  Which can be divided in syllables like this:  This meets the syllable requirements. Restricting yourself to writing markup in this form would be extremely challenging and time-consuming and pointless, so it, too, is a good sign that coders need more real work to do. The title text notes that if you are one of those assholes that are actually pronouncing the angle-brackets, then it would be even harder to write HTML in Haiku format. ""Left angle bracket"" and ""right angle bracket"" take up five syllables each on their own. (The asshole part is Randall's opinion about those who do pronounce <>). Haiku was mentioned later in 622: Haiku Proof.  Finally, the last panel mentions the biggest timesink of them all: webcomics! (Or, even worse, wikis devoted to explaining the jokes in webcomics.)  A haiku-compliant programming language does in fact exist: David Morgan-Mar (a creator of many esoteric and parodic languages) invented Haifu, a language that will only compile if it is arranged into subsets of 5 + 7 + 5 syllables. Unlike the HTML example in the comic, Haifu derives its functions and syntax from concepts in Eastern philosophy (such as naming its variable types after the five elements, replacing true and false with yin and yang, and defining arithmetic in terms of creation and destruction).","[Above the first two panels there is a caption:] Signs your coders don't have enough work to do:  [Cueball sitting in an office chair at his workstation, with Ponytail standing behind him.] Cueball: I'm almost up to my old typing speed in Dvorak  [Cueball is standing next to a server rack pointing at it while looking the other way at a Cueball-like guy.

568: Well 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/568:_Well_2,computers,"But I've made $13.72 already today! Ow, stop throwing pennies.","This is the second comic in the Well series: The first was 561: Well.  The average person's lifespan is 80 years now. So, while immortality may become a reality within the coming century, Ponytail won't live long enough to achieve it.  Cueball is looking for a programming language that does not need him to be specific about his ideas. When humans communicate ideas to other humans they may be vague but still understood, since the listener can infer a lot of detail from context and basic knowledge. Until we start 'raising' compilers (like you would a child) compilers will not possess that feature. Hence the need for the programmer to be exact in communicating his ideas to the compiler. No language will ever be able to change that. Cueball complains that he knows what he means.  Finally we find out that one of Megan's admirers, Mike, whom she avoids, is hiding in the well. He has been waiting for her to come for her uncomfortable truth, so he can make her believe that she is actually attracted to him. But she is not so easily fooled and calls his bluff, telling him to come out of the well.  The title text suggests he might also have been down there for the money everyone is throwing in to the  well to get this uncomfortable truth. So it has never been a working well. When everyone (or just Megan) finds out about this, Mike is bombarded with the all the pennies people have brought along.  In the comic game 1608: Hoverboard there is also a well in the left part of the world. This well has the same type of covered top and at the bottom (it is very deep) there is a girl and above her a coin, like the one thrown into a wishing well. On these links, to images on xkcd ; used in the game, the top and the bottom of the well can be seen.","[Four people are lined up by a covered well, Ponytail in front followed by Cueball, Megan and a man with some kind of hat (could be Beret Guy, but only half of his head is shown so it is not clear).

For every 0x5f375a86 we learn about, there are thousands we never see.","Cueball has solved some tricky and very important problem in computer science, related to queuing theory.  The comic splits into two timelines. Showing the brilliant computer code he'd written to somebody who actually knows computer code allows the academic to see the programmer's true brilliance and get him much-earned plaudits from the academic community.  In the alternate timeline - implied to be what actually happens - the boss, not possessing that knowledge, simply sees the results and not the means Cueball used to attain them. He then gives Cueball another assignment. This, sadly, is the usual course of events in bueraucracy, which only seems to care about your results, not how you came about them. To drive in the point, the boss asks Cueball to do something as simple as setting up e-mail on the office phones, a stark contrast to the skill and creativity Cueball would have needed to write his code in the first panel.  The references in the title text are to the P versus NP problem, a famous unsolved problem in computer science, and the ""magical constant"" (0x5f375a86) used in finding the fast inverse square root, i.e. y=x−½ - no-one knows quite who came up this very useful bit of code, but it was discovered hiding in the graphics code of the video game Quake III Arena.   The title text may be a reference to Stephen Jay Gould's quotation: “I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.” about how great minds may be exploited by the commercial world and their genius go unknown.","[Cueball sits at a desk in front of a computer.

743: Infrastructures,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/743:_Infrastructures,computers,"The heartfelt tune it plays is CC licensed, and you can get it from my seed on JoinDiaspora.net whenever that project gets going.","Cueball has sent an essay to a friend. While the essay itself was good, his friend was worried because the essay was in the .doc format, the proprietary format that old versions of Microsoft Word used. The friend advises Cueball to use a format based on an open standard,  possibly a format like ODF, ODT, ODS, ODP, or OpenOffice XML.   Cueball, who does not appreciate his friend's contradicting him, argued that the friend is making petty fights about the details of software instead of simply bothering that the software works (which is, in essence, a primordial purpose of software). Given that it can be a challenge to move from a familiar proprietary application to an open-source rival which may lack compatibility, features, support and popularity, Cueball has *some* justification for his stance.  The bearded fellow brings up that he is just concerned about the current proprietary software infrastructure that forces users to use software in a specific way, penalizing them for sharing the software or even preventing looking at the source code in order to learn what the program actually does or how it works. Cueball makes a retort that his friend has an arrogance that crowds out his perspective while claiming that he is autistic. However, it is highly unlikely that Cueball truly believes his friend is autistic. Instead, it's much more likely that he's comparing his friend's behavior to that of people with autism(such as his intense fixation on things that seem trivially important to others), similar to the banter used on online forums and imageboards such as 4chan's /g/ board.   Seven years later, Cueball runs to the friend, alarmed about Facebook's heavy policies about its complete control about the information its users submit. Since Facebook is like Microsoft in its lack of transparency about their services and taking away a lot of control from the user, the fellow retorts with playing ""the world's tiniest open-source violin.""   This is dubious since ""playing the world's smallest violin"" is a sarcastic expression that denotes that the speaker will not give pity to the recipient.  In response to this comic, a 3D model for a tiny violin was released as open source files.  The title text references the following pieces of infrastructure that are compatible with the ""free software"" ideology:  The problem with the lack of open source and Facebook is also the subject of 1390: Research Ethics.","2003: [Cueball approaches a bearded fellow.] Cueball: Did you get my essay?

754: Dependencies,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/754:_Dependencies,computers,"The prereqs for CPSC 357, the class on package management, are CPSC 432, CPSC 357, and glibc2.5 or later.","A compiler is a program that converts code, written in a particular programming language, into an executable program. A section of code is said to be dependent on a second segment of code if the results of the first segment are potentially impacted by the second segment. Dependency resolution is part of compiler design, and is the study of determining and correcting dependencies which result in an unwanted, ambiguous, or impossible definition of the dependent section. Requiring that an action occurs if and only if the action has already occurred, like the prerequisite in this comic, is one type of potentially unwanted dependency.  The comic envisions a college computer science course (CPSC432) focusing on ""compiler design with dependency resolution"" which has itself as a prerequisite. The joke is that the prerequisite is an unresolved dependency, as you must complete this course before you can enroll in it, a phenomenon called Catch-22.  This dependency would send a poorly designed compiler into an infinite loop. In real life, the problem is solved by allowing an object to satisfy itself as a prerequisite. This stops the compiler's infinite loop, but may not produce the desired functionality in the program. Another layer of the joke may be that any student who successfully enrolls in the class already knows this solution because they must have employed it in order to get past the apparent infinite recursion in the class prerequisites.  Managing dependencies is useful in other areas of computer science, e.g. package management. Collections of files are known as ""packages"". A software package might require that a particular operating system patch (a type of package) be installed first. That package might in turn require other packages be installed, and so on. Therefore, a package installer must know the dependencies of a package, and be able to figure out whether any required packages are missing before continuing with the installation.   The title text envisions a course on package management which has itself as a prerequisite, as well as the compiler design course with the impossible prerequisite presented in the main comic (CPSC 432), and glibc2.5 or greater. By looking at the course number it can be observed that CPSC 432 is a fourth year course, and this package management course (CPSC 357) is a third year course. Glibc is a commonly used package on Unix systems, and therefore should be taught in the course. This continues the joke since this course has the following unresolved dependencies:  The letter code ""CPSC"" is the letter code Christopher Newport University, Randall's alma mater, uses for Computer Science.","[A portion of a page from an imaginary course catalog.] Page 3    Department  Course  Description  Prereqs   Computer science  CPSC 432  Intermediate compiler design, with a focus on dependency resolution   CPSC 432  [The very top of the text for the next course in the table is visible but unreadable.]"
801: Golden Hammer,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/801:_Golden_Hammer,computers,"Took me five tries to find the right one, but I managed to salvage our night out--if not the boat--in the end.","Java is a programming language touted for its Portability™, which sometimes leads to it being used in systems where it really just shouldn't be used. Cueball laments that the hardware he's tinkering with, despite being used for a single purpose, has its firmware written in Java; since the microprocessor is unknown, it's quite possible the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) had to be ported over to the processor before the hardware designers could write firmware for it. Presumably, they considered this worthwhile to be able to write the control code in a language they're comfortable with, even though it probably would have been much simpler to just write the control code in whatever language they used to port the JVM in the first place.  Black Hat explains that this is really an example of an age-old adage: ""When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"", also referred to as the ""law of the instrument"" or, as in the title, the ""golden hammer"". The hardware developers probably only knew Java, and when they thought about how to write firmware for their new device, ""Java"" was the only solution that occurred to them.  Of course, instead of a hammer and a nail, Black Hat's analogy is about using bolt-cutters and vodka to get through the lock on Wolf Blitzer's boathouse. Not-so-coincidentally, Black Hat is holding a pair of bolt-cutters and a bottle of vodka. The implication is that Black Hat did, in fact, break into Wolf Blitzer's boathouse the previous night, which is why he has just now entered the door at the start of the strip. The changes he makes to the adage implies that he believes vodka and boltcutters are designed specifically to be used on Wolf Blitzer's boathouse, an interpretation that fits Black Hat's warped and anarchic disposition. As he is carrying both of these items, it also implies that he has just used those instruments for exactly that purpose. Cueball however, being extremely jaded by the (mis)use of Java, can only bring himself to tell that he's glad that Black Hat had a nice night.  The title text implies that Black Hat had to break into a number of boathouses before he found Wolf's, and that his boat did not survive the evening.  The use of the phrase 'our night' allows us to infer that Black Hat may have been with Danish, his partner in crime.","[Black Hat is going through a door, a bottle in his hand. A voice speaks to him from off panel.] Cueball: Seriously? This thing runs Java? It's single-purpose hardware!  [Cueball is sitting at a computer, holding some device which is wired to a box, and pointing at the screen.] Cueball: I bet they actually hired someone to spend six months porting this JVM so they could write their 20 lines of code in a familiar setting.  [Black Hat has a pair of bolt cutters in the hand that had been obscured in the first panel.] Black Hat: Well, you know what they say— When all you have is a pair of bolt cutters and a bottle of vodka, everything looks like the lock on the door of Wolf Blitzer's boathouse.

844: Good Code,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/844:_Good_Code,computers,You can either hang out in the Android Loop or the HURD loop.,"The comic references the common meme of programmers that one can't actually write good code. Either the code is done quickly with shoddy ""code style"", weak logical structure, or any number of other kludges and hacks which turn maintenance of the code into a nightmare; or else it is written well and beautifully structured, but can never be completed before changes in the situation cause the original code design to be insufficient for one or multiple reasons.  Either situation eventually leads to the need to completely start from scratch, designing and writing the program's code all over again. Of course, the writing of this new program is also locked in the perpetual cycle of choosing between ugly/bad code that works marginally well, or good/pretty code that never gets completed before being obsolete.  Additionally, the humorous point is being further emphasized for the primary target audience, programmers, by using an infinite loop - or more precisely, 2 possible loops and 1 forced loop in the flowchart itself.  Also, of particular note, is the fact that Randall (the author) drives home the point of the inescapability of the infinite loop(s) by the use of the additional, disconnected, and logically unreachable portion of the flowchart. This disconnect points out that the only way to actually get to ""Good Code"" using the flow chart would be to follow a path of actions — which does not start at the prescribed place — for which there is only an unknown and possibly unknowable starting action which no one has ever discovered previously. Other flowchart comics, several of which are also infinite loops, can be found here.  The title text, ""You can either hang out in the Android Loop or the HURD loop,"" makes a dig at both communities: claiming that Android developers always opt for fast, ugly code, necessitating frequent fixes and updates, while Hurd developers perennially choose to ""do the job right"" but can therefore never seem to finish their project.  The GNU Hurd Project aims to create the kernel for the GNU Operating System (the kernel being the central and most indispensable component). The GNU Project is most famous these days as a result of GNU/Linux (commonly called just ""Linux""), which is an operating system that uses the Linux kernel with the GNU system environment. From the beginning the GNU Project has planned to design their own kernel, the Hurd, virtually from scratch, and given a relatively clean slate with which to work, elected to employ a number of promising and theoretically elegant design concepts. Despite or, as Randall suggests, because of this, the Hurd has been mired in development hell for many years (for decades, in fact) with little progress towards actual usability outside of a small community of kernel hackers. While runnable GNU/Hurd operating systems do exist, they're still basically experimental, and the Hurd remains a collection of research software the design goalposts for which keep receding as other, more pragmatically-engineered technologies continue to be developed (the Linux kernel itself being the canonical first instance of this).  Finally, the transcript of this comic is itself somewhat humorous (an additional inside joke, if you will) in that it converts the flowchart into a simple list of instructions (aka pseudo-code) using numbered lines as reference points for identifying which instruction to read and follow next. This process is basically identical to the oft-maligned programming technique of using so-called ""goto loops."" — Furthermore, there is also a slight cross-reference between infinite loops and goto loops which is probably being referenced, in that goto loops are often criticized (whether accurately or not) as being more likely to create unintended infinite loops in code... primarily because of the difficulty inherent in keeping track of possible entry and exit paths, especially when making edits to the code at a later time.","[The comic is a flowchart In order to explain this in text, follow the line numbers.

Paired punctuation marks must always be matched up with a corresponding closing mark, otherwise a so-called syntax error occurs. The programming language Lisp (also featured in 224: Lisp) is known for large numbers of nested/paired parentheses. Even in literary works intended only for human consumption, the absence of a matching closing parenthesis (as appears in this sentence or other ""balanced"" punctuation sets creates a mental expectation of eventual closure and completion that remains unfulfilled even long after the unmatched mark is encountered. See what I mean?  There is also reference to 312: With Apologies to Robert Frost which could contain the missing parentheses.  It can also be interpreted as a metaphor, which compares the reader with a Lisp interpreter. The interpreter looks for the parenthesis until the end of the file, where it eventually halts, and prints out the error. The comic claims that if you read an unmatched parenthesis, you will look for it for the rest of the day too.  It also refers to this awkward feeling when you see something (like an unmatched parentheses, speling error or a randomly-placed, comma.

1163: Debugger,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1163:_Debugger,computers,It can take a site a while to figure out that there's a problem with their 'report a bug' form.,"Cueball mentions to Megan that he can't understand how his mind works, the same mind he uses to understand how things work, and he's not sure if this is a problem. In other words, if he can't understand how his mind works, then how can he tell that it does in fact work and that his perception of reality is accurate? Ordinarily he would use his mind to figure it out, but if his mind really doesn't work, then he'll probably never determine that his mind doesn't work. Understandably, he's a little unsure of how he should feel about this.  Per the comic title, a debugger is a piece of software used by programmers to find bugs in the applications they are making. The title is an allusion to that debuggers are very much like our brains in the aspect described above - most programmers don't understand how debuggers internally work, and they can't be sure that debugger is bug-free - if there is a bug in the debugger itself, it can't be accurately used to find bugs.  The title text alludes to the above problem, in that if a website's ""report a bug"" page is buggy to a degree that it prevents the actual reporting of a bug, then users cannot use the form to report that the form itself is broken. Thus it can take quite some time before the site administrators realize this error, if they do at all, as unless they test it themselves, the administrators are likely relying on users to report problems they find, which they can't, making it appear as if there are no problems. This is somewhat analogous to the ""brain"" dilemma in the main comic, where the usual problem-pondering and resolving method itself can have a problem, but there is no straightforward way to tell.","[Megan and Cueball are at the top of a grassy hill, rendered in silhouette.

1185: Ineffective Sorts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1185:_Ineffective_Sorts,computers,"StackSort connects to StackOverflow, searches for 'sort a list', and downloads and runs code snippets until the list is sorted.","The comic gives examples of four non-functional sorting algorithms written in pseudo-Python.  The first sort is an unfinished merge sort. The merge sort works recursively by dividing a list in half and performing a merge sort to each half. After the two halves are sorted, they are merged, taking advantage of the fact that the two halves are now in correct order and thus the merge can be done efficiently. The author of the merge sort in the comic appears to have given up on writing the sorted-merge part of the sort, which is why it's a half-hearted merge sort, but instead concatenates the halves without sorting. In its current state, the sort would divide the list into elements of size one, then recombine them in their original unsorted order, but in nested lists - making the original data more difficult to work with. The author acknowledges this failing with the comment ""Ummmmm... Here. Sorry.""  The second sort is an ""optimized"" variant of bogosort. A standard bogosort works by randomly shuffling the elements in the list until they are sorted. In a comment, the author points out that this variant of bogosort runs in O(n log(n)), whereas standard bogosorts actually run in expected O(n·n!) time but may never finish. This variant of bogosort finishes so much faster because in most cases it does not actually sort the list, instead reporting a fictitious error in the operating system (a ""kernel page fault"") if the list isn't ordered after shuffling log(n) times.  The bogosort is ""optimized"" because no comparison sort algorithm can possibly do better than O(n log(n)) in the worst case.  The third sort parodies a programmer explaining a quicksort during a job interview. The quicksort works by choosing an index as a pivot value and sorting all elements less than the pivot before the pivot and all the elements greater than the pivot after the pivot. It then does a quicksort to the section less than the pivot and the section greater than the pivot until the whole list is sorted. The interviewee flounders for a little while, then asks whether they can use the standard libraries to call a quicksort. Using the standard library's quicksort would allow the programmer to successfully execute a quicksort, but would not demonstrate that they understand how it works.  The final sort is just a mess. First it checks to see if the list is sorted, and exits if it is. Then it rotates the list by a random amount 10,000 times (as if cutting a deck of cards) and exits if the list is ever sorted. Next, in desperation, it checks if the list is sorted three times. Finally, realizing that they have no chance of success, the author performs the computer equivalent of a Rage Quit and attempts to destroy the computer rather than admit defeat. First, the program attempts to schedule a shutdown of the computer in five seconds, then attempts to delete the current directory, then attempts to delete the user's home directory (presumably the grader's files), and finally all the files on the computer. rm is a POSIX command; the -r and -f flags mean that the remove command will remove all contents of the specified directories and will not prompt the user beforehand. Under the guise of ""portability"", the program runs the equivalent Windows rd command with switches to delete all files from the ""C:"" drive without prompting. Finally, the program returns a list containing the numbers one through five in order.  In the title text, StackOverflow (link) is a question-and-answer site where programmers can ask and answer questions on programming. The author of this code takes advantage of the hopes that someone on StackOverflow knows what they are doing and has posted code to sort a list... and somebody implemented stacksort; well, sort of.",Ineffective sorts
1188: Bonding,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1188:_Bonding,computers,"I'm trying to build character, but Eclipse is really confusing.","This is source code written in the Java programming language which models a parent and a child playing a game of catch.  Normally this game is played with the parent throwing a ball to their child, who catches it and throws it back, and repeated back-and-forth. The comic title ""Bonding"" refers to the building of relationship between the parent and the child. The joke lies in the puns using the words try, throw, catch, and Throwable.  These can refer to actions in the real-life game, but are also keywords in the Java language that are used for exception handling, a method of signaling error conditions and responding to them.  Also, the terms ""parent"" and ""child"" are usually interpreted more abstractly in programming, as generic terms used in hierarchical data structures.  The program, as written, will recursively call the aim method alternately on the parent and the child indefinitely, causing each to take turns throwing and catching the Ball object.  Note that unlike the real game, this program actually has the same person both throwing and catch the same ball on their turn.  The ball is passed onto the other person by aiming it at them, which causes the person to both throw and catch the ball, and aim it back.  This program will also eventually crash with a stack overflow error.  The title text refers to the Eclipse IDE, which is a tool commonly used to develop software in Java. ""Building character"" is something that you would expect a parent to do, in order to instill in his child positive traits, such as confidence and athleticism. This is possibly a reference to Calvin and Hobbes, where Calvin's dad often encourages him to build character in a number of ways, including playing baseball. This is made more likely by other references combining technology and C+H, such as xkcd comics 409, 702, and 1002. However, here, ""build"" might also be a play on the term of ""building"" a program, while ""character"" refers to a data type in programming languages. It may also refer to the common notion that programming in C++ or Java builds character due to their powerful but sometimes finicky libraries.  To compile this Java source code, the two classes would need to be in a .java file. The program defines two classes (types of objects):  The program executes in the following order:",class Ball extends Throwable {} class P{ P target; P(P target) { this.target = target; } void aim (Ball ball) { try { throw ball; } catch (Ball b) { target.aim(b); } } public static void main(String[] args) { P parent = new P(null); P child = new P(parent); parent.target = child; parent.aim(new Ball()); } } 
1270: Functional,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1270:_Functional,computers,Functional programming combines the flexibility and power of abstract mathematics with the intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics.,"White Hat questions Cueball's faith in functional programming. Cueball responds saying, ""Tail recursion is its own reward.""  Functional programming is a style of computer programming that uses only function calls, and not other traditional programming tools like loops. Functional programming often uses recursive functions to serve the same purpose that loops serve in other programming languages. A recursive function calls itself again, typically with slightly different arguments. E.g., the following factorial function is recursive because it calls itself again for any argument value n greater than 1.  Tail recursion is a particular sort of recursion that often compiles into more efficient code (see the longer explanation below), but the differences between tail recursion and other sorts of recursion aren't important to the humor of this comic.  The comic is a pun on two readings of ""Tail recursion is its own reward"". The expression ""X is its own reward"" often is used to suggest that X is intrinsically valuable in its own right. Some (but not all) programmers and mathematicians find recursive functions elegant and intrinsically pleasing, so would take tail recursion to be its own reward in this sense. Since recursive functions call themselves again, and make use of the resulting values, there is also a sense in which recursive functions also serve as their own ""reward"" - i.e., the recursive function itself returns the values that the function requires to perform its tasks. So even if you don't find tail recursion intrinsically pleasing, there is still this technical sense in which it is its own reward anyway.  The title text is humorous in part because it violates two expectations. First, expressions of the form ""X combines some trait of Y with some trait of Z"" usually talk about combining traits of two different things (i.e., Y is not equal to Z) whereas this text surprises the reader by having ""abstract mathematics"" occupy the role of both Y and Z. And second, such expressions usually list two positive traits. The first listed trait (the ""flexibility and power of abstract mathematics"") is pretty clearly positive. However the second trait (the ""intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics"") is less clearly positive. Many people actually find abstract mathematics to be quite lacking in intuitive clarity, and for much the same reasons many people often find functional programming also to be lacking in intuitive clarity. So the title text invites the reader to puzzle over whether it really is a positive thing for functional programming to be able to claim to match the ""intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics"", or whether Randall might instead have just smacked functional programming with a funny backhanded compliment.  Functional programming is a famous paradigm (or style) in modern programming that favors functions that can be evaluated like mathematical functions, i.e., the value returned only depends on the input given. Imperative programs often make use of one or more variables that are external to the function that is currently executing. This means that an ""imperative function"" may return a different result for the same input due to changes in a non-local variable, whereas a ""functional function"" will in theory ALWAYS return the same result for a given input, though in practice the functional programming languages also support the non-local variables.  Unlike procedures, functions always return a value. For example, sine(x) returns 1 when x is 90°. Furthermore, the function may call itself (usually with slightly different parameters), thus effectively starting a loop. This is called recursion.  In order to iterate, imperative programs usually use loops. Functional programs usually use recursion instead.  For example, the factorial function (e.g. ""factorial(5) = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1"") can be coded imperatively as:  An imperative, recursive (but not tail-recursive) implementation can look like this:  In this situation, the recursion stops when the argument (n) is not greater than zero. Without the conditional definition, it would be an infinite loop. Tail recursion is a special case of recursion whose very last operation is to invoke the function itself or return a definite value. The previous example is not tail-recursive, since after the call to ""factorial(n-1)"", the returned value has to be multiplied by n.  This (functional) example is tail recursive inside the helper function:  e.g.  In functional programming, tail recursion is detected by the compiler or interpreter and can be executed as efficiently as loops in imperative programming languages. This makes tail recursion an essential programming technique in functional programming.  Cueball is making a play on words where ""Tail recursion is its own reward"" is used both in the ""it is worth doing on elegance and intellectually satisfying grounds alone"" sense and in the sense that ""the 'tail call' of a function is its final step, and is the final step (and hence the result/reward) for all levels of a tail-recursive function"".  The title text says that to abstract mathematicians functional programming is both powerful and flexible, as well as intuitive and clear since it comes very close to the way mathematicians usually describe functions. The humorous contrast is that, to non-mathematicians including the software engineers, functional programming can be exactly the opposite (thus being non-intuitive and unclear as abstract mathematics appears to them). Even the mathematicians often spend years of work to discover the subtle mistakes in the lengthy proofs. This leaves the reader unclear as to whether the statement is sarcastic or not. And it is also a reference to a common saying among the fans of functional programming about the imperative programming language, 'C': ""C combines the flexibility and power of assembly language with the user-friendliness of assembly language"", which is a humorous take on the original saying ""C combines the flexibility and power of assembly language with the user-friendliness of a high-level language"".","[White Hat stands behind Cueball, who is sitting at a computer.] White Hat: Why do you like functional programming so much? What does it actually get you? Cueball: Tail recursion is its own reward."
1275: int(pi),http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1275:_int(pi),computers,"If replacing all the '3's doesn't fix your code, remove the 4s, too, with 'ceiling(pi) / floor(pi) * pi * r^floor(pi)'. Mmm, floor pie.","This comic purports to provide a tip to programmers, that the number ""3"" is cursed and shouldn't be used. There is no explanation given as to why the number 3 is cursed, and it could well have been chosen arbitrarily. The title text hints that the consequence for using the cursed number is non-functioning code, a pain for any programmer. The absurdity of the number 3 somehow being cursed is part of the humor.  To assist the programmer, the comic gives an example of how to avoid the use of the number 3, by using a slightly convoluted method of using int(pi), which means the integer part of pi, without the fractional part. Pi, an irrational number, has a value starting 3.14159..., making int(pi) equal to 3. This is demonstrated in a formula to calculate the volume of a sphere, normally (4/3)*pi*(r^3), but converted for avoidance of the number 3 to (4/int(pi))*pi*(r^int(pi)).  For a number of reasons it is a good programming practice to use variables and constants where a value is used in multiple places, however this is not typically used in the case of natural numbers. There are unusual situations where this type of programming is a valid method, however typically for more specific circumstances, and not a certain number being seen as cursed.  In the title text, Randall takes the joke a step further, suggesting the usage of floor and ceiling functions: ceiling(pi) would be pi rounded up to the next integer, which is 4; and floor(pi) is pi rounded down to the next integer, which is 3. (Note that int(n) and floor(n) have the same value when n is greater or equal to zero. For values less than zero, int(n) is equal to ceiling(n).)  The joke here plays on the fact that basic rules of programming are confusing and novice programmers are often told to simply not do certain things without any explanation (see 292: goto). This includes, in particular, a general proscription against ""magic numbers"" in the code. Replacing all significant magic numbers with named constants makes programs easier to read, understand and maintain. Randall takes this to an extreme by suggesting that certain numbers could be inherently problematic, but the general idea is perfectly believable.  Mmm... Floor pie. is a reference to Homer Simpson.  See also Cargo cult programming.","volume(r) = (4/int(pi))*pi*r^int(pi) Programming Tip: The number ""3"" is cursed. Avoid it."
1277: Ayn Random,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1277:_Ayn_Random,computers,"In a cavern deep below the Earth, Ayn Rand, Paul Ryan, Rand Paul, Ann Druyan, Paul Rudd, Alan Alda, and Duran Duran meet together in the Secret Council of /(\b[plurandy]+\b ?){2}/i.","The comic is an attack on the problems with the philosophy of ""Objectivism"". White Hat explains to Cueball a program he wrote, the ""Ayn Random Number Generator"", which is a pun on Ayn Rand, the name of a writer who created a philosophical system known as Objectivism. The joke is an attack on her philosophy, which claims to be a completely fair mechanism for distributing resources, but inherently favors those who start out with more resources, or already in a position to acquire the resources. It also has a strong overarching theme that people that believe in objectivism are inherently better than other people, and thus deserve what extra resources can be acquired - as with the Ayn Random Number Generator, which claims to be completely fair and balanced, but actually favors some numbers - which White Hat explains by saying that they deserve to come up more because they're inherently better.  Now, objectivists, of course, would challenge the above portrayal, but the joke is, in the end, an attack on Ayn Rand's philosophies. A more nuanced description is that objectivists believe that the primary aim of life is to maximise personal happiness. In their view, if some humans are born more capable of satisfying their desires than other people, they deserve to reap greater rewards from life than others, no matter the cost to those others.  As an aside, ""biased"" random number generators exist. They're called weighted random number generators, and they have many practical applications when the programmer isn't lying about the number generator's function and output.  The title text identifies a group of people whose names match the regular expression /(\b[plurandy]+\b ?){2}/i. A step-by-step explanation of the expression:  Overall, it matches two words separated by a space, composed entirely of the letters in [plurandy], which is what all the names listed have in common.  As an aside, if the entirety of the title text is matched against the regular expression, it matches ""and Duran"" instead of ""Duran Duran"".  Since the primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is rationality (or, at least, ""rationality"" as defined by Rand: her critics argue that the conclusions she reached do not actually derive inevitably from her premises and that additional, unstated assumptions are necessary to make the system work), the implication may be that the random number generator favors rational numbers (numbers that can be written as a fraction, i.e. a quotient p/q). On the other hand, given computers cannot store data of unlimited length, it is impossible for any real world computer random number generator to produce an irrational number in any of the usual integer or floating point representations—so probably not.  (Although a computer could encode irrationals or generate them randomly if it uses another representation, one of the standard algebraic number representations, for instance.)  Alternately, an Objectivist might argue that if the intent of the comic is to attack or mock Objectivism, then the comic inadvertently satirizes itself via the ""rationality"" interpretation.","[Cueball sitting at a laptop, White Hat behind him.] Cueball: This Ayn Random number generator you wrote claims to be fair, but the output is biased toward certain numbers. White Hat: WELL, MAYBE THOSE NUMBERS ARE JUST INTRINSICALLY BETTER!"
1296: Git Commit,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1296:_Git_Commit,computers,Merge branch 'asdfasjkfdlas/alkdjf' into sdkjfls-final,"This comic refers to the Git source code revision control software, which saves earlier versions of files and folders for later access into a special repository. This comes handy when you want to try out whether an idea works (branching). Further, you can collaborate with others by use of remote repositories. Perhaps most importantly, it allows members of the development team to find key changes in the history, later.  A commit is a saved version in a Git repository; a commit comes with a message that is supposed to describe what the commit contains, similar to the edit summaries used on MediaWiki sites such as explain xkcd and on this explanation. Randall, however, finds himself losing interest in the commit messages the more code he writes and winds up just using placeholder text or jokes to himself. Presumably, this is because his separate commits are part of a large effort that can't be effectively summarized, and where there's no particular urgent need to differentiate the commits. Seeing as in this context 12 hours of coding can be considered ""dragging on,"" it's safe to assume that the kinds of commits Randall is talking about are not for some major in-production project, nor for something that a lot of other people are working on. In both of those cases, one would be much more likely to use descriptive commit messages, since you want to flag things that are important, either from a technical standpoint (e.g. ""fix the thing that's making the site not work"") or for the benefit of others who want to know which commits they should be paying attention to.  The phrase ""Merge branch 'asdfasjkfdlas/alkdjf' into sdkjfls-final"" mimics the phrasing used by Git. A branch is a specific sequence of commits which can be made in parallel to other branches of development, and later merged. Here, we see that Randall has also gotten lazy with his branch names: ""branch 'asdfasjkfdlas/alkdjf'"" might be the series of two commits starting with ""here have code"". ""sdkjfls-final"" could be the branch indicated by the vertical string of circles on the left, into which the other more branch is merged in commit ""adkfjslkdfjsdklfj"".  Most git tools show the commit history with the most recent commits first, so showing the oldest first like this would require something like the --reverse option.  The comments go from being pretty detailed as to his thoughts and reasons for the code (""enabled config file parsing""), to relatively uninformative summaries (""misc bugfixes""), to completely uninformative words (""more code""), and then finally he doesn't even bother trying to come up with words, instead just hitting a key (""aaaaaaaa"") or semi-random keys (""adkfjslkdfjsdklfj""), then goes back to typing words but words that have a bit of a craziness to them rather than having anything to do with describing the code (""my hands are typing words"").  The ""adkfjslkdfjsdklfj"" line and similar garbage in the title text comes from having your hands on the ""home row"" on a standard QWERTY keyboard, then hitting ""random"" keys without moving your fingers from their standard home row positions.  The keys you hit ""randomly"" will be combinations of A, S, D, and F on the left hand, and J, K, L, and ; on the right hand (although the ; key seems to have been avoided, possibly because without the presence of surrounding quotes a ; character will end the comment). It is common to see stuff like that when a person is required to type something — i.e. a mandatory field — but they have no interest in typing anything meaningful or no idea what to write, so they just hit the easiest keys to hit and call it done.

1312: Haskell,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1312:_Haskell,computers,The problem with Haskell is that it's a language built on lazy evaluation and nobody's actually called for it.,"The comic pokes fun at Haskell, a functional programming language. Functional programming languages are based on the mathematical concept of a function, that is two calls to a function always produce the same results given the same inputs. Side effects of a function call are changes to the program state or observable interactions with the outside world, other than returning a value. As a simple example, if a sum function changes a global variable, or prints the sum before returning it, those are side effects. Functions in most other languages frequently have side effects, typically making them hard to analyze. Functional programming languages seek to avoid side effects when possible. Pure functional programming language like Haskell push this agenda by isolating the inevitable side-effects (input/output at least) through the type system (more specifically in monads for Haskell).  The first joke says that Haskell only has no side effects because no one ever uses Haskell programs. Even in a traditional procedural programming language like C, if the program does not run it can't have side effects.  In Haskell effects are first class values. This means that you can use effects just like any value, assign them to a variable, pass them around, or manipulate them to make new and different effects. Thus, there are technically no side effects, only primary effects.  The title text is a joke about Haskell's lazy evaluation. The basic concept is that a value is not computed until it is actually used. Thus, it is possible to have a name representing the entire infinite list of Fibonacci numbers. However, until a particular element of the list is accessed, no work is actually done. The joke plays on ""called"" (referring to calling a function) vs. ""called for"" (requesting); thus Haskell may have value but no one has either invoked it to get that value or requested such a language. A simpler example may be:  The ""or"" function is defined as a normal function but can conclude instantly without computing the 10000th Fibonacci number (a daunting task) since this second parameter isn't necessary : ""true or whatever"" is always true.  In reality, Haskell is indeed actively used, though it is not one of the most popular languages. It is in particular used by some financial institutions, safety conscious start-ups and websites (there are several active web frameworks in Haskell) like Randall's own [1].",[Megan and Cueball are discussing.] Megan: Code written in Haskell is guaranteed to have no side effects. Cueball: ...because no one will ever run it?
1421: Future Self,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1421:_Future_Self,computers,Maybe I haven't been to Iceland because I'm busy dealing with YOUR crummy code.,"This comic is a joke about how the person you were in the past can be viewed as a distinct entity from who you are now, as well as the predictability of future events relating to your future actions.  The comic shows comments, informational notes left in the code that do not change the algorithm, from a project completed by Cueball some time ago that is still being used and maintained.  It is implied that Cueball is looking at these comments because the algorithm, a parsing function, is no longer working. These comments were written by Cueball's ""younger self"" in anticipation of being read by his ""older self"" at a date close to the present. The function has held up to the younger Cueball's expectations as it has lasted until the publication date of this comic, September 2014. The comments indicate a firm belief that the parsing function could not be easily ""re-kludged"" to handle the new situation but instead would need to be re-written. These comments are surprisingly accurate, leading Cueball to rhetorically reply to his younger self that these comments were creepy. Cueball's ""younger self"" must have anticipated a snarky reply and reminded his older self that his older self has likely not fulfilled his dream of going to Iceland. Cueball again replies that his younger self should stop judging him.   In the title text, current-day Cueball lashes out at his younger self, further emphasizing the way he is viewing his past self as a different person, blaming the ineffectiveness of his past self's coding for never going to Iceland.  A comment is a line, or a portion of a line, of code which should not be executed. A number of computer languages, including several popular ones, use ""#"" to indicate ""the remainder of this line is a comment"". The comment symbol tells the compiler to skip to the next line, ignoring everything after the symbol. Programmers make use of comments to leave notes about what a particular line or section of code is meant to do, places that require debugging, ideas for future revisions, etc.  The language in the comments is similar to how people address themselves in personal time capsules, in which they put letters away to read years later to see how much they've changed.  A ""parse function"" is code that interprets some form of input and makes sense of it in a way that enables functionality in some other part of the code. Parsers are commonly used to extract useful information from a source external to the algorithm.  Often parsing functions are written using regular expressions or in some other write-only language style. Parsing can be a difficult problem to solve, and programmers will often take shortcuts (perform kludges) based on assumptions on the kinds of input that the parsing function will have to handle, or possibly code through means of trial-and-error. As the programmer may not have control over the input, such as reading a page from someone else's web-site or using the output of an unpredictable program, an input that does not match the assumed the input syntax in can cause the parser to break, even if the parsing function has not changed.","[Cueball is sitting at a laptop, reading code. The two separate parts of code as well as the two comments by Cueball is connected with ""speak"" lines, with the line from the code going down to the computer screen.]  # Dear Future Self, # # You're looking at this file because # the parse function finally broke. # # It's not fixable.

1481: API,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1481:_API,computers,"ACCESS LIMITS: Clients may maintain connections to the server for no more than 86,400 seconds per day. If you need additional time, you may contact IERS to file a request for up to one additional second.","This comic presents a web site designed for human readers as if it had an API (application programming interface) designed for machine-to-machine web service. An API is a set of instructions about a computer program, intended to be used by developers of other computer programs, so the two programs can interoperate more easily. The documentation explains how to send commands to the program, and how the output will be returned.  Many web APIs are designed to return data in XML format. But in this case, the XML is XHTML, a version of the language that is used by all web pages. The ""requested data"" is the actual content (e.g. a blog post), and ""documentation"" refers (in an obscure way) to the parts of a web page that control how it looks on the screen (e.g. CSS and perhaps JavaScript layout code). The ""documentation"" may also be DTD which tells the XML parser info about this particular XML format, i.e. XHTML.   In order for a program to process a generic web site designed for human viewing, the program needs to use web scraping techniques, which often break when the web site design changes in subtle ways that a human might never notice. Therefore, developers prefer to have proper APIs with well-defined machine-readable formats, stable interfaces and documentation that actually describes the semantics of the data.  For example, Google has an official API for version 3 of their Youtube web service. But developers who don't want to hassle with the required API key or the costs associated with its use sometimes just scrape the regular YouTube web site. So someone could publish this comic with a YouTube URL as a convoluted hint to developers that there is an alternative to the official API.  The API keys section is a step-by-step description of how a web page is protected with HTTP Secure (HTTPS). The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol uses an elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key signed using Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption, which is stored in an X.509 certificate. Normally, the browser or operating system does this behind the scenes, so most web developers and users do not need to know these details.  The access limits mentioned in the title text says that the API can be used for 86,400 seconds each day. At first this may appear to be a strange arbitrary number, however it is in fact the total number of seconds in 24 hours, essentially meaning there is no limit on most days. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is the organization that decides when to add leap seconds, which account for slight anomalies in the Earth's rotation as compared to the mean solar day. These leap seconds will mean that the website is available for one extra second occasionally, although IERS decisions are based on actual Earth rotation rates and they of course wouldn't respond to requests for leap seconds in order to lengthen the number of seconds that a web site would be available for in a given calendar day.  The API does not discuss the issue that some days have 23 or 25 hours due to daylight saving time in the U.S. and summer time in Europe and some other places. This suggests that the web service tracks time via UTC.","[Cueball sitting at a desk staring at a computer screen.] API Guide Request URL format: http://~~~.com/<username>/<item ID>   Server will return an XML document which contains: The requested data.

In the talk, the highly technical audience was unable to correctly guess the results of adding various JavaScript types and roared with laughter when they were revealed. The programming language shown in this comic has types even more unpredictable than JavaScript.  Most regular programming languages distinguish types, e.g. integers, strings, lists… all of which have different behaviours.

In the middle sits the only creature the first creature is afraid of. Now just-- wait, where did THAT one go?","In this comic Megan asks Cueball to picture himself in a grassy field. It is a standard technique to begin a visualization by asking the person to imagine that they are in some calm environment (could be for any kind of meditation/mindfulness like for instance yoga). A grassy field could have been replaced by a beach at the sea, or a forest with sunbeams coming down through the trees.  Proceeding with the visualization Megan asks Cueball to imagine a creature with the power to be able to escape from any visualized scene, and then tries to convince him that this creature has indeed escaped from his current visualization as it indeed would be able to do. She then proceeds by apologizing for this, but then tells him (warns him) that it from now on might appear in Cueball's daydreams, so he should begin looking out for it. This indicates that she is not at all sorry, but did this intentionally to try and mess with Cueball's head. The idea of the possibility of escaping an imagined situation was already used in 248: Hypotheticals. Now that Megan has introduced both the idea of the creature and the idea that it may appear in his daydreams, Cueball will almost certainly think of it from time to time, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.  In the title text Megan proposes a solution to get rid of the creature in Cueball's daydream, namely by picturing the only creature that the first fears. However, if this new (maybe quite scary) creature should be able to pursue the original creature, then it would also have to be able to move through visualized scenes just as easily. And this is what Megan pretends happens again. So now the problem is that Cueball has two creatures on the loose in his daydreams. And even if the second scares the first away, he would then still have the new one to worry about.","[Megan and Cueball are walking together.]  Megan: Picture a grassy field.

The quotes around the word ""quoted"" are intended to be part of the text, but the language processor will likely confuse it for the end of the string, which would thus be two strings with quoted outside these strings (probably resulting in a syntax error).  To avoid this problem, an escape character (usually a backslash) is prepended to non-string-terminating quotes. So, the previous text would be written as ""This is a \""quoted\"" string"". The language processor will substitute every occurrence of \"" with only the quote character, and the string terminates at the quote character which does not immediately follow a backslash. In this case the resulting text string would be This is a ""quoted"" string as intended.  However, the problem now is that the intended text might contain a backslash itself. For example, the text ""C:\"" will now be interpreted as an unterminated string containing a quote character. To avoid this, literal backslashes also are escaped with a second backslash, i.e. instead of ""C:\"" we write ""C:\\"", where the language processor interprets \\ as one single backslash and the quote terminates the string to give C:\ as the output.  This doubling of backslashes happens in most programming and scripting languages, but also in other syntactic constructs such as regular expressions. So, when several of these languages are used in conjunction, backslashes pile up exponentially (each layer has to double the number of slashes). See example of a backslash explosion and alternatives to avoid this below.  This kind of backslash explosion is known as Leaning toothpick syndrome, and can happen in many situations. Below is an explanation of all the entries in the comic.  The backslash explosion in the title text is about a bash command (which uses the backslash to escape arguments) invoking the grep utility which searches for text following a pattern specified by means of a regular expression (which also uses the backslash to escape special characters). This leads to 3 backslashes in a row in the command, which could easily become 7 backslashes in a row if the text being searched for also contains a backslash.  Even advanced users who completely understand the concept often have a hard time figuring out exactly how many backslashes are required in a given situation. It is hopelessly frustrating to carefully calculate exactly the number of backslashes and then noticing that there's a mistake so the whole thing doesn't work. At a point, it becomes easier to just keep throwing backslashes in until things work than trying to reason what the correct number is.  It's unclear whether the regular expression in the title text is valid or not. A long discussion about the validity of the expression has occurred here on this explanation's talk page. The fact that many editors of the site, often themselves extremely technically qualified[citation needed], can't determine whether the expression is valid or not, adds a meta layer to the joke of the comic. This is an example of nerd sniping (oh, the irony\!\!\!\).  A reasonable example of a backslash explosion would be a PHP script on a web server which writes JavaScript code with a Regular Expression to be run on the client. If the JavaScript code has to test a string to see if it has a double-backslash, the Regular Expression to do so would be:  where the first two backslashes represent a single backslash and the second two also represent a single backslash, so this searches for two consecutive back slashes. And the JavaScript would be:  where every two backslashes means just one backslashes in the string, so the 8 backslashes in JavaScript become 4 backslashes in the Regular Expression. However, since this JavaScript code is to be written through a PHP script, the PHP code would be:  where:  So, the presented scenario has escalated from a simple test for \\ to no less than seventeen backslashes in a row without stepping out of the most common operations.   If we go a bit further and try to write a Java program that outputs our PHP script, we'd have:  Here, we have 35 backslashes in a row: the first 34 produce the 17 we need in our PHP script, and the last one is for escaping the quote character. (This comes closer to The true name of Ba'al, the Soul-Eater).  Some programming languages provide alternative matching string literal delimiters to limit situations where escaping of delimiters is needed. Often, one can begin and end a string with either a single quote or a double quote. This allows one to write 'This is a ""quoted"" string' if double quote marks are intended in the string literal or ""This is a 'quoted' string"" if single quote marks are intended. Both kinds of delimiters can't be used in the same string literal, but if one needs to construct a string containing both kinds of quote marks one can often concatenate two string literals, each of which uses a different delimiter.  Another feature that seems to be popular in modern programming languages is to provide an alternative syntax for string delimiters designed specifically to limit leaning toothpick syndrome. For example, in Python, a string literal starting with r"" is a ""raw string""  [1] in which no escape processing is done, with similar semantics for a string starting with @"" in C#. This allows one to write r""C:\Users""  in Python or @""C:\Users"" in C# without the need to escape the backslash. This does not allow one to embed the terminating delimiter in the middle of the string and prevents the use of the backslash to encode the newline character as \n, but comes in handy when writing a string encoding of a regular expression in which the backslash is escaping one or more other punctuation characters or a shorthand character class (e.g., \s for a whitespace character). For example, when looking for an anchor tag in HTML, I may encode the regular expression as <[Aa]\s[^>]*>. If I express this regular expression as a raw string literal, my code looks like  r""<[Aa]\s[^>]*>"" instead of ""<[Aa]\\s[^>]*>"". The point here is that leaning toothpick syndrome is such a real problem that it has influenced programming language implementations.  The title text when first published was   It was changed within a few days to   The original title text seems to be more relevant to the comic, but the revised title text seems to make more sense as a legitimate command line due to the way backslashes are interpreted in regular expressions.

1654: Universal Install Script,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1654:_Universal_Install_Script,computers,"The failures usually don't hurt anything, and if it installs several versions, it increases the chance that one of them is right. (Note: The 'yes' command and '2>/dev/null' are recommended additions.)","Most users of computers today are used to simple, easy installation of programs. You just download a .exe or a .pkg, double click it, and do what it says. Sometimes you don't even have to install anything at all, and it runs without any installation.  However, when things are more ""homebrew"", for example downloading source code, things are more complicated.  Under Unix-like systems, which this universal install script is designed for, you may have to work with ""build environments"" and ""makefiles"", and command line tools. To make this process simpler, there exist repositories of programs which host either packages of source code and the things needed to build it or the pre-built programs. When you download the package, it automatically does most of the work of building the code into something executable if necessary and then installing it. However, there are many such repositories, such as ""pip"" and ""brew"", among others listed in the comic. If you only know the name of a program or package, you may not know in which repository(ies) it resides.  The install.sh file provided in the comic is a shell script, which attempts to fix this problem by acting as a ""universal install script"" that contains a lot of common install commands used in various Unix-like systems. This script in particular is interpreted by the Bourne Again Shell (Bash), which is denoted by the #!/bin/bash in the first line. In between each of the install commands in the script is the & character, which in POSIX-compatible shells (including Bash, a popular shell scripting language) means it should continue to run the next command without waiting for the first command to finish, also known as ""running in the background"". This has the effect of running all the install commands simultaneously; all output and error text provided by them will be mixed together as they are all displaying on the screen around the same time.  The script accepts the name of a program or package as an argument when you run it. This value is then referenced as ""$1"" (argument number 1). Everywhere the script says ""$1"", it substitutes in the name of the package you gave it. The end result is the name being tried against a large number of software repositories and package managers, and hopefully, at least one of them will be appropriate and the program will be successfully installed. Near the end, it even tries changing the current working directory to that which is assumed to hold the package to be installed, and then runs several commands which build the program from source code.  All in all, this script would probably work; it runs many standard popular repository programs and package managers, and runs the nearly-universal commands needed to build a program.  Most of the commands would simply give an error and exit, but hopefully the correct one will proceed with the install.  One of the more subtle jokes in the comic is the inclusion of apt-get and sudo apt-get in the same script. Good unix practice dictates never logging in as root; instead you stay logged in as your normal user, and run system admin accounts via sudo program name. This prevents accidental errors and enables logging of all sensitive commands. A side effect of this, however, is that an administrator may forget to prefix her command with sudo, and re-running it properly the second time. This is a common joke in the Linux community, an example of which can be found at viral tweet which shows a humorous workaround for the issue.  Since Randall's script does not use sudo for any but the apt-get command, there are two possibilities: the script itself was run via the root user or via sudo, in which case the sudo apt-get is not needed, or the script was run as a normal user, in this case the commands may install a local (as opposed to system-wide) version depending on local conditions. For instance npm will install a copy of the package under $HOME/.npm and pip would work as long as the user is working in a virtualenv (which is standard practice for Python developers).  Sudo has also been used both by Randall in 149: Sandwich and by Jason Fox to force Randall to let him appear on xkcd with 824: Guest Week: Bill Amend (FoxTrot).  The tool curl downloads files from the network (e.g., the Internet). For example, curl http://xkcd.com/ downloads and displays the xkcd HTML source. The pipe | in the script attaches the output of the command before the pipe to the input of the command after the pipe, thus running whatever commands exist in the web content. Although this ""curl|sh"" pattern is a common practice for conveniently installing software, it is considered extremely unwise; you are running untrusted code without validation, there may be a MITM who modifies the code you receive, or the remote system could have been hijacked and the code made malicious. Most local package managers (e.g. apt, yum) offer digitally-signed packages that thwart this problem. You can find many examples of software providers suggesting a curl|sh solution at curlpipesh  There appears to be a bug with the & at the end of the ""git clone"" line; since a git repository typically contains program source code, not executables, it may have been intended to retrieve the source code with git and then compile and install the program in the next line. In this case, the single & should be replaced with &&, an operator that will run the second command only if the first one has completed successfully. This plays into a second bug on the ""configure"" line, where the placement of the & means that only the ""make install"" command will be run asynchronously after the ""configure"" and ""make"" steps have finished in sequence (though this would likely fail due to a lack for write permissions unless it was run with sudo). To make success as likely as possible, the two lines should be like this or script should be executed twice:  Since all commands are running in the background, any command that requires user input will stop and wait until brought to the foreground. A common request would be for a database password, or if it is allowed to restart services for the installation. This could lead to packages being only partly installed or configured. (See more about using ""yes"" below.)  The title text mentions the possibility that the same program may be in multiple repositories, so in this case, the script will download and install several versions, or it may fail on a number of repositories, in which case usually nothing bad happens. Since all the commands come from different operating systems, versions, or distributions, it is not very likely that more than one will work (with the exception of pip/easy_install and the two forms of apt-get) or even exist on the same system. It mentions that adding a way of automatically saying ""yes"" to questions asked during the different repository-fetching programs' running, by making them read input from another program that writes a (nearly) endless stream of ""y""s, could simplify things further. This would not work for any curses-based menus, or to answer any more complicated questions. Adding 2>/dev/null to a command redirects the second output stream (the ""error stream"") to the null device driver, which discards all writes to it, meaning errors (the package not existing) will not be sent to the screen.","[In the panel is a shell script which, unusual for xkcd, uses only lower case.

1667: Algorithms,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1667:_Algorithms,computers,"There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control.","An algorithm is a basic set of instructions for performing a task, usually on a computer. This comic lists some algorithms in increasing order of complexity, where complexity may refer to either computational complexity theory (a formal mathematical account of the computational resources – primarily computation time and memory space – required to solve a given problem), or the more informal notion of programming complexity (roughly, a measure of the number and degrees of internal dependencies and interactions within a piece of software).  At the simplest end is left-pad, or adding filler characters on the left end of a string to make it a particular length. In many programming languages, this is one line of code. This is possibly an allusion to a recent incident when NodeJS Package Manager angered a developer in its handling of a trademark claim. The developer unpublished all of his modules from NPM, including a package implementing left-pad. A huge number of programs depended on this third-party library instead of programming it on their own, and they immediately ceased to function.  Quicksort is an efficient and commonly used sorting algorithm.  Git is a version control program, i.e., software that allows multiple people to work on the same files at the same time. When someone finalizes (""commits"") their changes, the version control program needs to join the new content with the existing content. When more than one person has made overlapping changes at the same time, the process of figuring out how to join them is called merging, and the algorithm for it is anything but simple.  A self-driving car is an automobile with sensors and software built into it so that it can maneuver in traffic autonomously, i.e. without a human controller. Various companies have been working on such vehicles for many years now, and while they're further along now than would have been imaginable even a couple of years ago, we're still far away from the dream of hopping in a driver-less taxi and sitting back as the car itself navigates to where we want to be. Recently Randall has made several references to self-driving cars which has become a recurring topic on xkcd.  The Google Search backend is what enables you to type ""what the heck is a leftpad algorithm"" into your browser and have Google return a list of relevant results, including correcting ""leftpad"" to ""left-pad"", truncating ""what the heck is"" to simply ""what is"", and sometimes even summarizing the findings into a box at the top of the results. Behind all that magic is a way to remember what pages the Internet contains, which is just a mind-bogglingly large quantity of data, and an even more mind-numbingly complex set of algorithms for processing that data.  The last item is the punchline: a sprawling Excel spreadsheet built up over 20 years by a church group in Nebraska to coordinate their scheduling. Spreadsheets are a general end-user development programming technique, and therefore people use Excel for all sorts of purposes that have nothing to do with accounting (its original purpose), including one guy who made a role-playing game that runs in Excel; but even that doesn't approach the complexity that develops when multiple people of varying levels of experience use a spreadsheet over many years for the purpose of coordinating the schedule of several coordinated groups.  The scheduling of tasks over a group of resources (a.k.a. the nurse scheduling problem), while respecting the constraints set by each person, is a highly complex problem requiring stochastic or heuristic methods for its resolution. Here, the algorithm would be further complicated by being solved by inexpert users over a spreadsheet model without using engineering practices. The potential hyperbole here is in thinking that such combination of circumstances would produce complexity far over that required to drive a car or sort the public contents of the Internet. While most churches meet mainly on Sunday morning, scheduling of what happens during the service when (especially if there are multiple concurrent services) as well as Sunday School, church business meetings, and congregation-wide events all potentially needing to be scheduled on a particular Sunday morning, the need to find a solution very close to the best possible solution quickly becomes a dire need. Furthermore, with different members involved in a wide variety of activities within and outside of the church, and the classrooms available to the church on Sunday itself, (just scheduling the choir practice times to coordinate with everyone's work schedules is very possibly impossible, especially if two people share the same occupation, and one is the relief for the other,) can indeed be daunting. In addition, there would likely be assorted committee meetings and youth groups during the week.  In the title text, part of the spreadsheet's complexity is described as originating from different versions of the file for different programs. The words used like schism and sect are normally used in context of religions splitting into groups about differences in beliefs. In this case, the split seems to have been not over a theological issue, but about the use of open-source vs. proprietary software, disagreements about which are often compared to religious debates. Most likely, the schism being referred to is the East-West Schism of 1054.  The title text also implies that while trying to reconcile after the schism and to merge the two schedules they reinvented an alternative to Git within the spreadsheet itself, making the algorithms in place at least as complicated as that. Since most spreadsheet programs have a sort algorithm built in, that aspect is implied too, and left-padding could be compared to vamping on an introduction to a hymn. This would indicate that the other milestones of complexity are either included in the current version of the spreadsheet or are planned to be implemented.

1671: Arcane Bullshit,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1671:_Arcane_Bullshit,computers,"Learning arcane bullshit from the 80s can break your computer, but if you're willing to wade through arcane bullshit from programmers in the 90s and 2000s, you can break everyone else's computers, too.","When fixing/improving an existing computer program, programmers sometimes need to read, understand, and improve old code. The older a piece of code is, the less it tends to conform to modern programming practices, and the more likely it is to be ""arcane bullshit"" from the perspective of a 21st Century programmer.  Randall seems to feel that willingness to deal with ""arcane bullshit"" is a ""Catch 22"" that prevents 80s arcane bullshit from being fixed. Someone completely unwilling to deal with arcane bullshit would lack the patience to learn how to program. Someone extremely willing to wade through an 80s programmer's arcane bullshit is likely to ""nerd snipe"" (356: Nerd Sniping) themselves into fiddling with kernels (which are inherently arcane bullshit) instead of making useful code. Cueball is in the middle of the scale: smart and patient enough to make the 80s bullshit worse, but not smart and patient enough to know how to fix it.  This comic could be a reference to changes in programming methodologies. As the first computer programs were written in the 40's and 50's they were prone to becoming ""spaghetti code"", where the flow of execution would jump from one part of the program to another using the JUMP which gives no state information. While this method of programming can work very quickly, it makes it difficult to predict program flow and can create interdependencies that are not obvious. In the BASIC language JUMP was called GOTO and the courses for new programmers argued that using GOTO in all but trivial cases was a very bad idea. On the other hand, old programmers argued that calculated GOTO was a sexy way of programming.  To combat the problem computer scientists have relied on increasing the levels of abstraction and encapsulation, by developing structured programming, procedural programming, and OOP (object oriented programming).  In structured programming you break your program into well defined blocks of code with specified entry and exit points. Using the stack (a portion of memory dedicated to storing information / program state) it is possible to call a block of code and then have that block of code return control to the point that called it after it has done what was requested.  Very quickly it was decided to mark these blocks of code as functions or procedures, making it a lot easier to know how to call the blocks and edit them. Languages that made this a focus include Pascal, Modula, and C.  Structured and procedural programming were well entrenched in the 80's. Most systems programming was done in mid- or low-level languages, which to improve performance don't do much to control access to the data structures in the programs. Because they are low level the code requires many steps to do seemingly easy things like draw a box on a screen, making it hard for a non-experienced programmer to understand what is happening.  Although the idea of OOP was around as early as the 1950's, it was not implemented in a widespread fashion until the 1990's. OOP encapsulates the data structures inside of functions, so rather than manipulate the variable directly you call the data structure and tell it to do something. This additional level of abstraction can make it a lot easier to work on varied data. It also can protect the program data from unexpected changes by other sections of the program.  Because code in the 80's was typically done at a much lower level, it can be hard for programmers used to having the language and libraries do more work for them. It also meant that programmers would often hard code expectations into their source code such as the number of files that can be opened at once, or size of the operating system disk buffers, rather than make them configurable while the program is running, or even while it was being loaded. This means if you need the program to handle a larger file, you might need to recompile it after finding and changing all the places in the code that assume the smaller max file size.  As such, few people are willing to try to surpass the massive barrier to learning. This group is on the left. To the right are people who have gotten so used to the tools and conventions of the 80's that they spend all of their time adjusting and recompiling the kernel of their computers to match their current needs, instead of actually creating new programs.  In the center is Cueball, presumably representing Randall, who has learned enough to try and fix code, but not enough for his fixes to actually work.  As programs age, they often lose support from the initial project head and die out, no longer supported on new computers. So, as the title text says, learning more coding from the '90s and after is necessary for also breaking everyone else's computers.  This could also be a comment on hacking and the advent of the internet and the technologies behind that (TCP/IP, HTML, CSS, PHP...) being 90s/2000s. Computers in the 80s were typically stand alone so what you are learning can only be applied to your machine. To break everyone else's you need to understand networking.  The title text might be a reference to various recently discovered security vulnerabilities in open-source software. In some cases, underskilled programmers have provided flawed code for critical infrastructure with very little review, resulting in global computer security disasters. Randall described some of these in 424: Security Holes (2008), 1353: Heartbleed and 1354: Heartbleed Explanation (2014). Other recent examples include Shellshock and vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel involving the perf and keyrings subsystems.",[A horizontal graph with arrows pointing left and right with labels.

1685: Patch,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1685:_Patch,computers,"My optimizer uses content-aware inpainting to fill in all the wasted whitespace in the code, repeating the process until it compiles.","Adobe Photoshop is a commonly used application for image manipulation. One of its features is the Patch tool, which allows the user to overwrite parts of the image, replacing them with a copy of another area of the same image. It is often used for “patching up” photographs by overwriting scratches or other visible damage to the photo. Another of Photoshop’s features is “content-aware fill”, which could also be described as “content-aware inpainting”. It works similarly to the Patch tool, but automatically generates a replacement texture from the area surrounding the deleted part instead of copying a user-specified area exactly.  GNU patch is a program that replaces only parts of code with an updated version, without requiring the user to download the entire source code. Here, it appears the author was told to “patch” the code, but used Photoshop to do this instead of GNU patch, with devastating results. Although the title text suggests that if you did this enough times the code would eventually compile, this would never happen. In fact, Photoshop could only edit an image of the text and not the text itself. However, it could work if optical character recognition (OCR) were integrated into the workflow as well.  The comic blurs the difference between text (in which letters and symbols represent discrete values, such as 65 being the number for the letter A in the ASCII encoding standard, and it's relatively easy for a program compiler to interpret combinations of these values as keywords and other programming constructs) and graphics (where the letters and symbols in the comic are actually represented by a pattern of colored dots), playing with the idea that the patch metaphor can be used on both (although with different meanings). There are common and straightforward processes for converting text information to images, such as printing, which can convert text to a graphics format very faithfully. The reverse, however, requires the use of optical character recognition (OCR), which attempts to figure out which letter or symbol certain patterns of dots ""look like"". OCR could be effective in converting some of the image in the comic back to usable text, however it would fail on some of those patterns that have been mangled and don't look like any existing characters or symbols. A compiler can only operate on text data, so converting the graphic back into text would be a requirement to even begin to attempt to compile it, a step omitted in the title text.  The code appears to be written in Python, a programming language often referred to in xkcd, such as in 353: Python. A few of the function names that can be recognized are ""isPrime"" and ""quicksort"", both elementary programming algorithms. It was also apparently originally edited using a Python-aware programming text editor, which is able to use different colors for different programming elements. For example, it appears to use red for keywords, blue for variables, and black for other elements, however because of the mangling from the use of the wrong patching program, that doesn't appear to be consistent. Since the patching replaced graphical elements rather than whole characters, there are examples of symbols that are combination of two different characters, and when the original two characters were rendered in different colors the resulting non-character could be in two colors, or the resulting ""word"" might be rendered in multiple colors.  The comic brings to attention the high rate of Adobe Photoshop piracy. GNU Patch is available for free, even for Windows, and Mac OS X. So the comic implies that Adobe Photoshop, subscription to which costs $20/month, is more available than GNU patch. According to this poll, 58% of Photoshop copies were pirated.  The title text also explains that patch used the content-aware inpainting to fill in all the wasted whitespace in the code. In most programming languages, whitespace is necessary to separate words, so this would combine words that shouldn’t be combined and create invalid code. Since the code in the image is Python, the code will be messed up even more, because Python uses whitespace as a part of its programming syntax. For example, statements are separated by new lines instead of by semicolons (;), and indentation is used instead of brackets to determine the scope of each section of code.  The original code was likely as follows:  isPrime and quicksort are standard python implementations of simple algorithms (although you would not generally write a sorting algorithm in python as there are built-in algorithms available).  isPrimeRegex uses the re module to detect if a number is prime by seeing if a string containing that many 1s can be matched to 2 or more copies of some string containing at least 2 1s.  The comic two comics back 1683: Digital Data, also related to turning digital data into bad copies. Less than a month before quicksort was mentioned in 1667: Algorithms, and a month before that another ""easy"" solution to a programming problem was released in 1654: Universal Install Script.  Using a Photoshop tool for a task it is not intended for was also used in 1784: Bad Map Projection: Liquid Resize, where Photoshop's content aware resizing tool was a very questionable choice to use for a Map Projection.","[The panel displays part of a code, in five different colors (red, purple, light blue, blue and green) as well as normal black text, which due to image editing is difficult to read.

1742: Will It Work,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1742:_Will_It_Work,computers,"Copy and paste from a random thread on a website' is the hardest to predict, and depends on the specific website, programming language, tone of the description, and current phase of the moon.","This comic humorously lists how likely computer code is to function on the user's computer based on the source of the code.  App store or package manager:  Most likely referring to the Apple's Mac or iOS App Store, Google's Google Play, Microsoft's Windows or Windows Phone Store, or package managers such as Debian's Advanced Packaging Tool (APT). Programs in the App Store are already compiled from raw code into executable files that have been tested on their respective platform -- otherwise they would be rejected from the storefront -- and so should be expected to run with no effort from the user. Similarly, a package manager for a Linux OS handles downloading and installing the program requested, as well as installing any dependencies (other programs or libraries needed by the desired program, potentially including locusts) automatically.  GitHub Link: GitHub is a website where people can host Git repositories of code that they are working on. Since Git is built to track changes in code for an entire project, it is likely that all of the code needed to run the project is included in the download. One reason it may be less reliable than the previous entry is that it may not include external libraries expected to already be on the user's computer.  SourceForge Link: SourceForge is similar in scope to GitHub : hosting source code repositories but also binary packages. But it is older and dwindling in popularity. As a results, a project hosted on SourceForge is more likely to be abandoned.  Geocities/Tripod Link: Geocities is a now defunct free website host. Tripod is a similar website host owned by Lycos. The fact that the software comes from there means that nobody has paid attention to the project since Geocities shut down. Which could mean that code rot has begun to take effect, with various dependencies being less and less likely to work over time.  Copy-and-paste example from paper's appendix: Some academic papers publish code or pseudocode (example of a paper with pseudocode in appendix) in order to illustrate their concepts, strategies or algorithms. Often this code is not meant to be compiled because it is thought to illustrate ideas rather than be used in an actual working piece of software. Copying and pasting this code and trying to compile it will rarely give a satisfactory results, and that is why it is at this point in the comic's spectrum.  Anything that ""requires only minimal configuration and tweaking"": The punchline of the comic is that something advertised as having been tested and working with ""minimal configuration and tweaking"" on the system it was developed on turns out to be a frustrating mess that will almost inevitably require huge fixes for anybody else trying to get it to function. It's also often used by technically advanced people who are not aware how difficult even minimal configuration and tweaking can be  for beginners.  The title text refers to websites such as Stack Overflow that allow users to post questions about their code and other users answer. Websites like StackOverflow usually generate useful answers but the quality may be lower if the conversation is disgruntled (i.e. if the asker has put in very little effort to solve the problem themselves) or if the language is less commonly used. The title text of 1185: Ineffective Sorts also references executing arbitrary code until it works, in that comic the code is actually mentioned as being from StackOverflow.  Saying that something ""depends on the phase of the moon"" usually means that there is some apparently random component to the problem, as neither the performance of a program nor the quality of answers on websites should depend on the position of the moon in its orbit. However, there was at least one case where the phase of the moon did, in fact, trigger a bug in code.  This comic released the day after Rosh Hashanah, a Jewish holiday that always occurs at or near a new moon.  It is not clear whether this is why Randall was thinking about moon phases or just a coincidence.  The shape of the moon was the subject of 1738: Moon Shapes released during the week before this comic was released. This comic is called Will It Work, the previous comic was just called 1741: Work","[Caption above the panel:] Likelihood you will get code working based on how you're supposed to install it:  [A chart with a double arrow going from the top to the bottom.

1755: Old Days,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1755:_Old_Days,computers,"Lot of drama in those days, including constant efforts to force the ""Reflections on Trusting Trust"" guy into retirement so we could stop being so paranoid about compilers.","This comic is showing a conversation between (young) Cueball and (old) Hairbun about computer programming in the past, specifically the compilers. Cueball, having a faint idea of just how difficult and byzantine programming was ""in the old days"", asks Hairbun to enlighten him on the specifics. Hairbun promptly seizes the opportunity to screw with his head.  While her initial agreement that code needed to be compiled for multiple architectures is correct, Hairbun's claims rapidly grow ridiculous to the point where the improvement from C to C++ was that C++ finally supported floppy disks but just punched holes in them rather than using punch cards ""like C used"".  Hairbun tells Cueball a tall tale about how hard it was back in the old days, making it sound like some of the programming languages used today (C, C++) were written on punch cards and that you had to ship your code in the mail to a computer company (IBM in this case) to compile your code, which would take from four to six weeks. If there was a simple error, you would have to ship it again for another compilation.   This is factually incorrect, but is plausible to those who do not have the knowledge or context to challenge it, similar to a Snipe hunt, or several other cultural myths told about things like the Tooth Fairy. It is clear from Cueball's final Wow that he falls for it. She then continues to explain more and more implausible so-called facts from the the olden days.  What she says is true in that it was tough and slow to program on punch cards, which were actually used for an extended period of time. However, there is very little in the rest of Hairbun's story that accurate, except that it was a big deal when the floppy disk was invented.  The comment about punching holes in floppy disks is true. However, the nature and purpose of the holes punched this way was dramatically different than in punch cards; it was common to punch holes into both 5.25"" and 3.5"" floppy disks to increase the storage space the computer had access to within them, rather than on punchcards where the punching several holes was itself the act of programming. It is unclear if this was a coincidence, or intentionally included as a humorous aside to the readers who know the history as a misinterpreted truth in a sea of falsehoods.  In the title text, Hairbun continues her musings on the old compiler days, stating that there was a lot of drama in those days. Specifically she references Reflections on Trusting Trust a famous 1984 paper by UNIX co-creator Ken Thompson in which he described a way to hide a virtually undetectable backdoor in the UNIX login code via a second backdoor in the C compiler. Using the technique in his paper, it would be impossible to discover the hacked login by examining the official source code for either the login or the compiler itself.  Ken Thompson may have actually included this backdoor in early versions of UNIX, undiscovered. Ken Thompson's paper demonstrated that it was functionally impossible to prove that any piece of software was fully trustworthy.    Hairbun claims that one of the dramas she refers to was that people tried to force Ken Thompson to retire, so everyone could stop being so paranoid about compilers.  In reality, any coder who created the first version of a compiler (or a similar critical component) could inject a similar backdoor into software, so it would be false safety. Even if no one else had thought of this, then Thompson's paper was there for any future hacker to see. Though the problem was (claimed to be) solved in David A. Wheeler Ph.D dissertation ""Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC)"".  Nine years before this comic was released Randall made a comic called 303: Compiling. The next comic after this one, 1756: I'm With Her, was released Monday the day before the 2016 United States presidential election. And in that comic a Cueball with a sword on an office chair like in the old compiling comic is featured. Seems realistic that Randall had that politically loaded comic ready for some time, and when finding and deciding to use that old version of Cueball, he may have gotten inspired to make this comic about compiling in the old days.","[Cueball and Hairbun are standing together and Cueball is talking to her.] Cueball: What were things like in the old days? Cueball: I hear that you had to ... compile things for different processors? Hairbun: Yeah  [Same setting in a slimmer panel, now Hairbun is replying.] Hairbun: To compile your code, you had to mail it to IBM. Hairbun: It took 4-6 weeks.  [Close-up of Hairbun from the waist up.] Hairbun: Before garbage collection, data would pile up until the computer got full and you had to throw it away.  [Same setting as in the first panel with Hairbun gesturing toward Cueball raising one hand  palm up.] Hairbun: Early compilers could handle code fine, but comments had to be written in assembly.  [In a frame-less panel Hairbun is seen from the front, with both arms out to the side with both hands held palm up.] Hairbun: C could only be written on punch cards.You had to pick a compact font, or you'd only fit a few characters per card.  [Exactly the same setting as the first panel, but with Hairbun doing the talking.] Hairbun: C++ was big because it supported floppy disks. Hairbun: It still punched holes in them, but it was a start. Cueball: Wow."
1790: Sad,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1790:_Sad,computers,"With the right 90-degree rotation, any effect is a side effect.","The comic is about Cueball confronting Ponytail about her recent behavior and emotional state, which has lasted a few months. It's implied that she (and thus also Randall) is sad following last year's election, though the actual reasons for Ponytail's frustrations and depression aren't dwelt on and the focus is on her retreat into video games and the damage it's doing to her work projects.   Sadness could come from many causes (breaking up, family member dying etc). However, the notion that this comic is political is supported by the fact check in the second panel, and also that this was only the second comic released after Donald Trump's inauguration. See more about these issues and other recently released sad comics here.   Ponytail has retreated to video games for solace to the point that her real life projects are suffering.  Stardew Valley is a video game in which a player creates and manages a virtual farm. And when Cueball mentions that her projects have stagnated, she retorts that her farm in the game is doing great. A comic with the name of that game was releases only two weeks later, 1797: Stardew Valley, indicating that it is indeed Randall who has played this game excessively (see the title text), and thus again confirming that the comic is about Randall (or his surroundings) sad state of mind.  Cueball's statement about not being able to hide from everything is a common one to give to insecure people or to those trying to run away from their problems. Ponytail's reply is in the form of a PolitiFact reply, claiming (possibly quite truly) that such assertions are mostly false, one of the six options, but it is far from being the worst, thus acknowledging that you can't hide from everything, just mostly. See more about Politifact.com in the comic 1712: Politifact. This is the only political answer she gives in this comic, but it is another clear indication (by Randall and Ponytail) that her trouble is with Trumps leniency with the truth in both election campaign and since, to the point where lies are now on a daily basis just called alternative facts or post-truth.  In computer programming, comments are non-functional content that a programmer adds to their code to make a note for themselves or others, typically to explain a complicated piece of logic or document external dependencies of a piece of code. Instead, Ponytail has been writing unrelated notes filled with obscenities. Ponytail's reply is one of typical advice given to amateur fiction and non-fiction writers, to ""write what you know."", implying that all Ponytail knows right now is obscenities.  Also in programming, functions are pieces of code which developers create to avoid repetition and make the code clearer (such as ""calculate distance between points"" or ""process values""). A function which does nothing is almost useless (although sometimes programmers leave functions empty when they create the skeleton of a program, but then they usually intend to fill them out later). It is expected that a function does something with a given parameter, but Ponytail’s function does nothing with the parameters except returning the parameter but with the comment No, you deal with this. Thus she wishes that somebody/something else deals with any problem, probably what she would also wish for right now, where she is so sad that she even neglects her projects.  Ponytail replies that she writes them like this in order to try to avoid side effects (i.e. changes to global state), in line with a functional programming paradigm. When Cueball points out that she avoids all effects, Ponytail quotes part of a famous quote from Ripley in Aliens: I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. By replying that it's the ""only way to be sure"" she is thus indirectly saying better safe than sorry, but in reality she just doesn't care about her programming anymore because of her sad state of mind.  The title text is a pun, interpreting the phrase ""side effect"" literally. If you turn an object 90 degrees along the right axis you will place it on its side, so thus making it a effect of putting something on its side, or a ""side effect."" You can also turn 90 degrees (along another axis), facing what was previously your side.","[Cueball is walking up to Ponytail who sits at her desk in an office chair typing on her computer.] Cueball: How are you doing? Ponytail: Hah. Cueball: You seem distant lately. For the past few months. Ponytail: Can't imagine why.  [Cueball talks to Ponytail at her desk from off-panel.] Cueball (off-panel): Your projects have stagnated. Ponytail: But my Stardew Valley farm is doing great.  Cueball (off-panel): You can't just hide from everything.  Ponytail: Fact check: Mostly false.  [In a frame-less panel Cueball is seen standing behind Ponytail at her desk.] Cueball: I'm glad you're including more comments in your code, but it would be nice if they were comments about your code.  Cueball: Or at least a bit less obscenity-filled. Ponytail: Look, they say to write what you know.  [Cueball leans forward towards Ponytail at her desk (who has looked on the screen in the same position through the entire comic).] Cueball: All the functions you've written take everything passed to them and return it unchanged with the comment ""No, you deal with this."" Ponytail: It's a functional programming thing. Avoiding side effects. Cueball: You avoid all effects.  Ponytail: Only way to be sure."
1831: Here to Help,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1831:_Here_to_Help,computers,"We TOLD you it was hard. ""Yeah, but now that I'VE tried, we KNOW it's hard.""","This comic is a satire of computer programmers, who sometimes forget that not everything can be solved with an algorithm, or of the tendency to think computers are the answer to everything. In the first panel, Megan talks about how the field that she and Hairy works in has a difficult problem that many people have been working on. Cueball, believing that algorithms can solve their problem, tries to help. In the next panel, Megan and Hairy silently watch Cueball working on the problem on his laptop. Finally, six months later, Cueball concedes, and an exasperated Megan retorts sarcastically, pointing out that she had explained its difficulty six months ago with the timeline.  The title text furthers Cueball's apparent arrogance by showing a dialogue. Megan or Hairy says, ""We TOLD you it was hard,"" referring to the first panel, but Cueball, still confident in his own ability's superiority, says, ""Yeah, but now that I'VE tried, we KNOW it's hard."" The joke is that Cueball believes that, even though he has just failed, it was his attempt which proved the difficulty, and not Megan and Hairy's work for years. The dialog references an exchange from the recent film The Imitation Game, in which Alan Turing's superior claims, ""The Americans, the Russians, the French, the Germans, everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable."" and Turing replies, ""Good. Let me try and we'll know for sure, won't we?""   The satire, however, applies far beyond computer programmers.  It can be read as a political commentary, like in Nobody knew health care could be so complicated. It is what we'd all like to see when well-meaning advice givers provide the ""simple"" solution to all our problems, or management provides glib advice from ten thousand feet.  It is a commentary on the universal tendency to see problems as simple because we don't know what makes them hard.  This comic calls back to 793: Physicists and possibly 1570: Engineer Syllogism in central theme.","[Megan, standing next to Hairy, is addressing the reader holding her arms out. Cueball walks in from the right.] Megan: Our field has been struggling with this problem for years.  [Cueball holds his laptop high up in one arm above Megan's head while holding his other arm out as well. Megan has turned to look at him.] Cueball: Struggle no more! I'm here to solve it with algorithms!  [In a frame-less panel Cueball sits on a chair at a desk with his laptop working on it, while Hairy and Megan looks on from behind.]  [Cueball, still sitting at his laptop, points at the screen. Megan raises her arms and four small lines above her head, on either side of her speech line, indicate her annoyance with Cueball.] Six months later: Cueball: Wow, this problem is really hard. Megan: You don't say."
1883: Supervillain Plan,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1883:_Supervillain_Plan,computers,"Someday, some big historical event will happen during the DST changeover, and all the tick-tock articles chronicling how it unfolded will have to include a really annoying explanation next to their timelines.","In this comic Black Hat is a supervillain, befitting his character. He plans to use drones and explosives to move the entire State of California into the Pacific, a la Lex Luthor in the 1978 Superman movie.  His henchmen are Cueball and Megan. The latter appears to be a programmer who is concerned that the mission (and hence the drones' coding) may have to account for time/date adjustments, such as time zones and daylight saving time (DST), which would be a factor if the event took place on the wrong date or the landmasses were pushed too far apart. (Though by coding the drones on UTC, the drones would not need to change time zones, except for displaying the local time for some reason, which would likely be unneeded.)  In computer programming, working with dates and times can be complicated. Think about leap years or leap seconds, the non existing year zero which even worse for scientists does exist in astronomical calendars, or the Y2K and year 2038 problem. Nevertheless in this comic there is only a time zone problem mentioned. To handle this the tz database, also known as tzdata, provides all relevant information for every country back to 1970 and, less accurate, before. But it's still up to the programmer to use this data in useful ways.  Supervillains have reason to fear daylight saving time issues. In 1999, two coordinated car bombings ended up killing the terrorists transporting the bombs when they exploded one hour early. Details explained e.g. on the Darwin Awards site.  Time zones and DST can give seemingly nonsensical results when used improperly. For example, a flight going west might leave at 02:00pm and reach its destination at 03:00pm while the reverse flight will leave at 02:00pm and arrive at 05:00pm. In both cases, the travel time is two hours, but the one hour difference between the two time zones makes it seem otherwise. You might even find yourself arriving at your destination at an earlier time than your departure! DST can also makes a given time mean two different things, if after 01:59am you go back to 01:00 am, 01:30am can either be one hour after 00:30am, or one hour before 02:30am. Or in the reverse change, some dates don't actually exist, like 02:30 when going straight from 01:59 to 03:00. Humans often avoid this issue by being in only one place at the same time[citation needed], or by sleeping when the DST changes happen, but computer communications often span over large distances, and drones don't need to sleep at night. Megan wants to make sure she won't have to deal with the difficult problem of communication between drones and other systems with those issues, where a single poorly communicated date can have disastrous effects (although possibly far less disastrous than moving California into the sea[citation needed]).  California is currently located entirely within the UTC-8 time zone (at standard time PST, while in summer PDT is at UTC-7). But after Black Hat's actions California is at risk of floating West into the next time zone at UTC-9.  However, in reality, time zones in the United States are determined by Department of Transportation regulations, and California's time zone is not defined based on its longitude. Consequently, even if California were pushed out to sea, its time zone would remain the same unless the Department of Transportation issued a regulation otherwise, so Megan can rest easy. (On the other hand, Black Hat could alter the time zone of any of the East Coast states except Maine if his drones could push the state east of 67°30″ W. longitude, since the Eastern Time Zone's eastern boundary is mostly based on longitude, except for Maine.)  Note: Megan should be happy Black Hat hasn't planned to involve Arizona in his scheme.  A ""tick tock article"" is a term in journalism for a step by step account of an event or timeline, such as this one recounting the end of the 2011 MLB regular season. Such an article published for an event during the change to or from Daylight Saving Time would need to account for the changeover, making the timeline confusing for those unaware of the switch.","[On the left of this single panel comic Black Hat sits on a high throne, showing a fist, and looking down to Cueball and Magan who stand in front of him on the right.]  Black Hat: ... then, after our drones take control of the cities, we will detonate the devices. California will break off from the mainland and drift out to sea! Megan: How far out to sea? Will it put any of the cities in the UTC-9 time zone? Black Hat: What? I don't know. Megan: One request: Can we make sure this doesn't happen during the daylight saving changeover?  [Caption below the panel:] You can tell when someone's been a programmer for a while because they develop a deep-seated fear of time zone problems."
887: Future Timeline,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/887:_Future_Timeline,computers,"Not shown: the approximately 30,000 identical, vaguely hysterical articles titled ""WHITE PEOPLE IN [THE US/BRITAIN] TO BECOME MINORITY BY [YEAR]!"", which came up for basically any year I put in.","This comic uses the same strategy as comic 715: Numbers, in which Randall uses Google to search for phrases and then charts the results. This one is charted as a timeline, whereas 715 was charted as line graphs. It is a list of things predicted or announced by anyone at any time (the ones you see on Google search using ""by the year..."" or similar statements).  ""2101 - War Was Beginning"" is a reference to the opening narration of video game Zero Wing; the same narration is famous for the internet meme ""All your base are belong to us"". As there are not any other out and out references in the comic, and the rest are actually results that you can find using Randall's methods, ""War Was Beginning"" was probably the only thing he got when he googled 2101 as well.  Certain events in this comic, e.g. ""Social Security stops running surplus"", are repeated multiple times. Also, certain bizarre events, like ""Apocalypse occurs"", or ""Flying cars reach market"", happen before rather plausible things, like ""HTML 5 Finished"". Certain events, like ""Japan is a robot-only country"" or ""Gillette introduces 14-blade razor"" may be related to the recurring theme 605: Extrapolating.  The title text is born of a recurring ""white people panic"" situation; scaremongers will predict white minority in the very near future in order to get the panicked racist people to pay attention to them (without actually using valid or accepted scientific measurements to back up these claims- panicked racist people don't exactly fact-check very much), while level-headed sociologists will usually come up with more distant, if not nonexistent, dates from their extrapolations.  This comic has similar features to 1413: Suddenly Popular, 1093: Forget, and 891: Movie Ages.  The only predictions for this period that came true are that the world population has surpassed 7 billion. Canada formally withdrew from the Kyoto protocol in December 2011, and its emissions in 2012 were 18% above 1990 levels (though its population had grown 26% and its GDP had grown 67% in that period). Sadly, homelessness is still a problem in Massachusetts. The prediction about GNU/Linux operating systems remains false; although Android (which is built on the Linux kernel) is currently the most dominant OS, it is not completely GNU/Linux, which remains an extreme minority on consumer devices. And so far as we're aware, the apocalypse has yet to occur.  New Horizons is to make its closest approach to Pluto in July 2015.[1] It was never intended to land on Pluto.  Android OS' market share was already 84.4% as of the third quarter of 2014, showing that both estimates were overly conservative.[2] Windows Phone continued to have less than 30% of iOS' market share.","THE FUTURE According to Google search results Events for each year determined by the first page of Google search results for the phrases:    ""By <year>""  ""In year""   ""By the year

1193: Externalities,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1193:_Externalities,computers,Mouse over words and things to see where they come from.,"This comic isn't a static image - even the title text changes depending on which part of the image you're hovering over. It presented a competition for students to see who could come closest to break a Skein hash but also an aid appeal for the Wikimedia Foundation.  There are quite a few references in the comic to Baidu. Baidu is a large Chinese Internet services company that employs thousands, whose shares are publicly traded on world stock exchanges. It's the predominant Internet search provider of China, and is sometimes called the ""Google of China"". It offers parallels for the Chinese market of many of the services that Google provides and offers its own encyclopedic wiki with a restricted edit policy to serve as a replacement for Wikipedia. Wikipedia reports that Baidu's search engine handled 56% of Chinese internet search queries in Q4 2010. and that in October 2012, Baidu ranked 5th overall in the Alexa Internet rankings. Given that explanation for the Baidu references in #1193 is still solicited for explainxkcd, Baidu apparently is not well known yet among savvy XKCD readers. Baidu Search results reputedly follow the censorship dictates of the Chinese authorities, causing it to return censored responses to searches for politically sensitive terms like ""Tianamen Square massacre"" or ""Falun Gong"" when executed by web browsers that are connected via Chinese ISPs. When you execute such searches via Baidu in the US, the top links returned for these topics do seem to reflect Chinese government sensibilities although the uncensored English language Wikipedia articles for these topics are listed high in the query results. Baidu's reputation for censorship provides background for Megan's reply ""but nothing about Tianamen Square"" in response to the ""Come and find your future at Baidu"" employment enticement of panel one and also provides the background to understand the ""It takes great minds to stifle other great minds"" slogan of the second panel.   The blank regions in the above image are dynamically generated from various sources.  For the two days until comic 1194 appeared, a competition was underway to see who could come closest to breaking a Skein hash.  The first text line of the first panel contains a link to http://almamater.xkcd.com. This page contained the text:  On this page, users were invited to enter ""Your school's domain name"" — presumably intended to be their college alma mater. (At least in the beginning, only a few top-level domains were accepted.) If the user entered an acceptable domain (by xkcd's rules, which apparently changed during the 48 hours of the competition), he could then enter data values one at a time. For each data value entered, xkcd returned a hash value and the number of bits by which it differed from the target value. The object was to achieve the lowest possible number of differing bits, ideally zero.  A ranking page showed the lowest value achieved for each domain name entered, but not the data that achieved it. The first name on the list was substituted in various panels, and the third-place school showed in panel five. No data values were reported by xkcd, but various results were posted by users of the xkcd forums and on other websites, leading to copycat submissions, so that occasionally large numbers of institutions would show the same moderately low value.  After the end of the contest, the data submission page vanished, replaced by the final list of rankings, which shows that Carnegie Mellon University achieved the best score with 384 bits incorrect out of 1024.  The rankings only show a few hundred out of the several thousand domains submitted—presumably Randall chose to chop the copycat submissions off the end of the list, retaining only honestly obtained results.  In some cases, Megan's reply seems to correspond to the company.  The text in the second panel is based on the company in the first panel:  The text in the form varies independently of the text at the top, sometimes related to the organization in 3rd place:  The title text documents the different sources of data in the comic. The different title texts are:","[This was a dynamic image where the text changed during April 1st. The main title text also changed after the dynamic part was finished, and there are even different title text for different part of the comic.

1539: Planning,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1539:_Planning,computers,"[10 years later] Man, why are people so comfortable handing Google and Facebook control over our nuclear weapons?","Big companies have always tried to get the greatest amount of information from their customers, because that translates into more money earned. However, ability to gather, store and process such information is limited by the technology available. With the recent development of computers, this ability has grown far more than anyone could have suspected just 20 years ago; to the point that companies like Google or Facebook get almost unimaginable amounts of data from their users; and this data is gathered and stored automatically and can be efficiently accessed.  This data is routinely used to, for example, tailor online ads to the browsing history of the user seeing the ad. They could potentially be used for more evil purposes, like selling the medical history of users to insurance companies. Many users don't feel that they're giving out so much information, and in fact that few of them have given Google or Facebook their medical history. However some leaks have proven quite the opposite. In the AOL leak referenced in 155: Search History, searches for ""how does a male's cocaine use affect a fetus"", ""hysterectomy"" or ""8 alcohol drinks a day"", surely would be interesting for a medical insurance company to know.  In the comic, Ponytail is puzzled because people are not worried about Google or Facebook using their information in evil ways; however Megan raises a quite fair point, namely that the huge amount of nuclear weapons in existence is much scarier, and that was worrying to the general public in the 1980s, however people have grown tired of that and now concerns have moved to internet privacy only because it's ""new"". What is perceived as dangerous or worrying follows trends and fashions not directly related to real danger (i.e. ""happen on auto-pilot""). The point Megan is making is that maybe it's better to just accept that things work in this way and go with the flow. This is very similar to what happens in 1480: Super Bowl or 1534: Beer.  In the title text we move ahead 10 years, to a similar conversation where the two aspects of the above have been inexplicably mixed. A future equivalent to Ponytail asks why we all think it is OK to hand over the control of our nuclear weapons to Google and Facebook, which would certainly be a nonsensical route to take. This could also be seen as another step toward the singularity, from which perspective handing over control of nuclear weapons could be desirable, catastrophic, implicit and/or unavoidable.  This comic was posted on the day after Vladimir Putin had announced that Russia would add 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles to its nuclear stockpile this year.  Within a year Randall has made several other comics about nuclear weapons, the first of these, 1520: Degree-Off, came just 1½ month before this one. Later  these two comics were released early in 2016: 1626: Judgment Day and 1655: Doomsday Clock. Nuclear weapons are also mentioned twice in Thing Explainer, specifically they are explained in the explanation for Machine for burning cities about thermonuclear bombs, but they are also mentioned in Boat that goes under the sea about a submarine that caries nukes. All three comics and both explanations in the book, does like this comic, comment on how crazy it is that we have created enough firepower to obliterate Earth several times (or at least scourge it for any human life) [citation needed].","[Megan and Ponytail are walking] Ponytail: Why are people so comfortable handing Google and Facebook all this control over our lives? Megan: I dunno. Megan: Our species built thousands of nuclear weapons, scattered them around the planet, and then moved on to other things. Megan: Maybe it's best to accept that some of this big-picture planning is just happening on autopilot."
1546: Tamagotchi Hive,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1546:_Tamagotchi_Hive,computers,"The Singularity happened, but not to us.","A part of the ""My Hobby"" series, this describes a distributed computing network using an automated system to simultaneously run trillions of Tamagotchis. As with most of the ""My Hobby"" series, the concept would work, and is closely connected to real world activities, but twisted enough to make it inherently absurd.  A Tamagotchi is a keychain-sized virtual pet simulation game from 1996. Ostensibly for children, they had appeal for people of all ages. The characters are colorful and simplistically designed creatures based on animals, objects, or people. Beginning with the 2004 Tamagotchi Plus/Connection, a second wave of Tamagotchi toys emerged, featuring a different graphic design by JINCO and gameplay which elaborated upon the first generations. However, the story behind the games remained the same: Tamagotchis are a small alien species that deposited an egg on Earth to see what life was like, and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult creature. The creature goes through several stages of growth, and will develop differently depending on the care the player provides, with better care resulting in an adult creature that is smarter, happier, and requires less attention. Gameplay can vary widely between models, and some models, such as TamagoChu, require little to no care from the player. Tamagotchi has a shrinking fan base.  Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a software system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Examples of distributed systems vary from service-oriented architecture based systems to multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications. Distributed computing is often used for tasks that require resources which would otherwise be impossible or prohibitively expensive to manage with single computers. This may include large Bitcoin network mining operations, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid or, yes, running trillions of simultaneous Tamagotchis using an AI protocol. That said, using AI to keep trillions of Tamagotchis perfectly taken care of is a complete waste of time; the whole point of Tamagotchi is the challenge of caring for the digital pet yourself.  ""The Singularity"" in the title text refers to the technological singularity; a concept prevalent in science fiction and discussions of artificial intelligence (AI). The idea is that AI would become so sophisticated compared to a human brain that no human would be able to predict its behaviour, motivations etc. from that point onward, and potentially human history after that point would therefore become unpredictable, as AIs would play dominant roles in determining its direction. It uses the metaphor of a mathematical ""singularity"", which is a point where established rules can no longer apply (for example, in a black hole or during the Big Bang, physical conditions are such that the physical laws we use can no longer meaningfully predict what happens). An AI that is more sophisicated than a human brain could presumably then simulate human brains within itself, making it possible to upload human consciousness into a machine-simulated environment (see simulated reality and the simulation hypothesis). Thus, much science fiction that is based on the idea of The Singularity also focuses on the creation of a virtual world that much of the human race decides to plug itself into, much like the Tamagotchi Hive that Randall has created. Randall's mind, and the processing power in his computer, is far greater than any individual Tamagotchi mind, so simulating Tamagotchis becomes trivial for Randall, and no Tamagotchi could predict or control its own history with Randall around, in a humorous analogy with the Singularity concept.",My Hobby [A tree graph of Tamagotchis.] Running a massive distributed computing project that simulates trillions and trillions of Tamagotchis and keeps them all constantly fed and happy
1621: Fixion,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1621:_Fixion,computers,"My theory predicts that, at high enough energies, FRBs and perytons become indistinguishable because the detector burns out.","The second Christmas comic in a row, the first being 1620: Christmas Settings.  This comic was released on Christmas day as a present from Randall to all physicists. It introduces a new particle, the Fixion, which explains everything. The word ""Fixion"" can be read as a pun: Either it can mean something like ""fix-i-on,"" with ""-on"" being a suffix for many particles, and this particle being able to ""fix"" things; or it means ""fiction"".  In physics, there are still many big questions and mysteries. There are many phenomena which don't seem to fit, and we don't know how to explain yet. The ""Fixion"" is satirically presented as a particle which acts as a Deus ex machina, (see also tvtropes), which solves all of these mysteries without any serious fundamental reasons.  The style of the chart suggests a Feynman diagram - an easy way of drawing particle interactions. Every time there is an interaction, the main central Fixion-line changes direction. Typically, fermions (the ""solid"" particles like electrons and quarks) are shown with solid lines, photons (and generally the weak-force-carrying bosons) are shown with wavy lines, gluons with spiraling lines and other mediating particles (such as pions in the nuclear force, or the Higgs boson) with a dotted line. Randall obeys these rules only very loosely, which makes sense - many of the things involved in this Feynman diagram are either so theoretical that they have no widely used standard representation, or would never appear in a sensible diagram (spacecraft, for instance). All mentioned types of lines - and even more types - are presented in the diagram. All that the Fixion does is described in the table below.  The title text is a continuation of one of the jokes already mentioned in the main comic (fourth phrase from the top to the left) about Fast radio bursts (FRBs) and perytons. See explanation in the last entry in the table below.","[Caption above the panel:] A Christmas gift for physicists: The Fixion A new particle that explains everything  [A chart resembling a Feynman diagram is shown. It begins with a solid line coming down at the top, going a little to the left. The line continues downwards all the time, but changes direction 16 times before exiting at the bottom almost straight under the starting point. At every point where it changes direction, there is some kind of “interaction” with something outside this line. There are 19 phrases, 10 on the left and 9 on the right. 11 of these are distinct labels for points on the line as 14 gray curved arrows points between these 11 phrases to specific points on the line. Three of the phrases on the left has two arrows pointing to two different, but close, parts of the line. The main central line is solid all the way, except at the very bottom, where it “disappears” inside a hole only to “reappear” later from a similar hole. Between these two holes the line is dotted. The lines going away (or to) the main line can be straight and solid, straight and dotted, wavy lines (with different waviness), even looking like a spiral. Two straight solid lines ends up at two space probes, and finally the last two straight solid lines coming in (and out) on either side of the “hole” in the line has arrow pointing in and out. Below the phrases will be listed in reading order, taking one on each side alternatingly. Above each is described if there are any arrow and, if there are, what they points at.]  [Left: Arrow pointing to the very first part of the main line:] Main component of dark matter   [Right: Arrow pointing to the very first part of the main line, but below the previous arrow:] Confines quarks and gluons   [Left: Arrow points to the first solid line going left and upwards:] Neutralizes monopoles   [Right: No arrow:] Suppresses antimatter in early universe   [Left: Two arrows points to two dotted lines going out left and downwards below the first solid line:] Spontaneously emits dark energy   [Right: Arrow pointing to several lines going almost parallel with the main line. The first line closest to the arrow is not connected with the main line. It bends closer to the other lines in the middle. The next line is connected to the main line, and is thus actually two lines going in to the main line. The same goes for the inner line, where there is some distance between the entry and exit, as the middle of these three lines connect to the main line in between. In principle there are four lines going in/out and one not connected, but it looks like three lines:] Mediates proton decay but then hides it   [Left: One arrow points to the first wavy line (7 peaks) coming out and up towards the dotted lines above. A second arrow points further down the main line where there are three more wavy lines coming out, but to the right, they are all of the same length and go almost straight right, only a little down. The first has as short a wave length as the line above to the left, but as it is shorter it only has 6 peaks. Then the wavelength decreases to a very long one for the last, 5 peaks and then 3 peaks. The arrow points almost where the middle wavy line exits the main line:] Introduces dispersion in perytons from kitchen microwaves, explaining fast radio bursts   [Right: An arrow point to the part of the main line between the three parallel lines and the first wavy line:] Broken symmetry causes ϴ=0, explaining unobserved neutron dipole moment   [Left: No arrow:] Causes alpha effect   [Right: No arrow, but right next to the middle of the three wavy line:] Covers naked singularities   [Left: An arrow points to a spiraling line going upwards to the left:] Intercepts certain gravitational waves before they're observed.   [Right: No arrow, but right next to the bottom of the three wavy line:] Causes coronal heating   [Left: No arrow:] Higgs-ish   [Right: A long arrow point to the point of the main line just below the line pointing to the bottom (and left) of the space probes:] Superluminally smooths anisotropies in early universe (but adds faint polarization for BICEP3 to find)   [Left: One arrows point towards the point on the main lines where a solid line goes to the right and up and another arrow points on another solid line going away from the main line towards left and down. At the end of both lines are drawn spacecrafts with satellite dish and solar panels:] Accelerates certain spacecraft during flybys   [Right: No arrow, but right next to the solid line with an arrow going into the main line just before the first hole where the main line disappears and becomes dotted:] Triggers Siberian sinkholes   [Left: No arrow:] Melts ice in ""Snowball Earth"" scenario   [Right: Arrow points to the dotted part of the main line between the two holes:] Transports neutrinos faster than light, but only on certain days through one area of France   [Left: No arrow but the last solid line, with an arrow pointing left, that is going away from the main line, point almost directly at it:] Suppresses sigma in experiments"
924: 3D Printer,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/924:_3D_Printer,computers,I just can't wait for the Better Homes and Gardens list of helpful tips for household reuse of sixteen-inch acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene phalluses.,"With the ongoing development of 3D printing technology, the cost of low end 3D printers continues to reduce steadily, and the complexity of modelling and producing components is becoming easier. These factors, among others, means that 3D printers are beginning to be found in homes, rather than exclusively in businesses. Ponytail & Cueball are discussing the improvements and expect widespread deployment soon.  Spam emails promoting penis-enlargement products are very common, and often show images of unnaturally large penises to advertise how effective they are. The adverts prevalence and aggressive marketing techniques have made them a well known staple of email inboxes, though the improvement of spam filters has increasingly banished them to the spam folder.  Cueball and Ponytail predict that the spam producers will quickly jump on the opportunity presented by the widespread prevalence of 3D printers, and start advertising their wares with 3D printed phalluses. Usually someone would have to chose to print out a spam email, but it wouldn't be difficult to imagine a scenario where the email contains malicious code which automatically prints them a huge phallus.  In the title text, Better Homes and Gardens is an American magazine that, as the name suggests, shows you how to make your home and garden better often by reusing common household items in new and innovative ways. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (or ABS) is a light-weight and moldable plastic which makes it perfect for 3D printers.","[Two people before a 3D printer, one with a wrench.] Cueball: 3D printers are getting incredible. Ponytail: I think we're not far from widespread deployment.  Ponytail: And you know what that means.  Cueball: Spam containing actual enlarged penises? Ponytail: I give it a week."
1783: Emails,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1783:_Emails,computers,"Hey Rob, sorry it took me a while to get back to you! Sure, I'd love to see WALL-E opening weekend! Are you still doing that, or...?","In this rather late New Year comic (January 9th), Megan asks Cueball if he has any New Year's resolutions. New Year's is, to many people, a time for thinking about the year and coming up with resolutions to improve themselves. These kind of resolutions hardly ever work.  Cueball replies that he has one resolution. It's to finish reading and replying to his backlog of emails from 2008, 9 years prior to this comic. He obviously does not read his email when they arrive in his inbox, and he now vows to at least get those e-mails from 9 years ago read.   As he further states in the caption below, he now (finally) begins to doubt his method for replying to e-mails, since his backlog now approaches 10 years. Some would probably say he should have found this out when his backlog approached 10 days, or at least when it reached a month.  A common technique for the productive members of the world is to batch reply to email instead of replying to each one individually as they come. The principle is that setting aside specific times to reply instead of always being ""on call"" gives the messages the attention they deserve while avoiding the urge to constantly check your email when you should be doing important work. Such a technique could be to check and answer all your emails once a day, or once a week, for instance and allocating a specific amount of time like one hour every day to do so. It is unlikely that somebody would wait years to start the task of checking emails, so obviously the time reserved per unit of time is way too short, if even existing. This would create a backlog of emails, that could soon be so large it would take years to catch up to the e-mail you just got right now.  Another technique for productive people is not to answer certain e-mails; if a subject really is important, the sender will send a reminder a few days later. (If he does not, the sender can be presumed to have solved the problem himself, saving lots of time on the receiver's side. Of course then you have to check your e-mails to realize if someone has sent a reminder.) Cueball has possibly used this technique on a friend's request, but became remorseful after nine years.  The title text is a reply to an email in which Rob wished to see the movie WALL-E, a film that came out in 2008, with Cueball during its opening weekend. However, the opening weekend is now far in the past, and yet Cueball doesn't realize it and trails off with ""are you still doing that, or...?"" Mentioning the release of a popular movie and then making it clear that it will soon be ten years ago that the movie came out, feels a lot like a hidden Comic to make one feel old, but it may be stretching it to include this directly in that category. But it is a technique often used by Randall, quite clearly in most of that category, for instance 891: Movie Ages.  A real (and useful[citation needed]) New Year's resolution would involve trying to answer his emails as they arrive (instead of spending any more time on years old emails), which would have avoided the mess he's currently in, and will stop it from getting worse in the future.  In this comic Cueball may represent Randall. He receives so many e-mail due to the xkcd comic that he may have a hard time going through them all. Then there is his what if? email, and possibly many more. Hopefully he has a separate e-mail for friends that wish to send him a request for going to the opening of new recent movie. On the about page on xkcd he does write the following for one of the e-mails he cites as contact:","[Megan and Cueball are walking along.] Megan: Did you have any New Year's Resolutions? Cueball: Gonna finally finish dealing with those emails from 2008.  [Caption below the panel:]  As my email backlog approaches 10 years, I'm starting to have doubts about my approach."
1873: Email Reply,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1873:_Email_Reply,computers,"I would be honored, but I know I don't belong in your network. The person you invited was someone who had not yet inflicted this two-year ordeal upon you. I'm no longer that person.","Cueball is sitting at his desk writing an email. He is responding to Kevin, who sent him an email two years ago. Cueball is so far behind in responding to his email, he goes to great lengths to apologize for it. Instead of blaming the email culture which creates enormous quantities of messages, he blames himself for not keeping up. Failing to answer emails is a common symptom of general anxiety disorder, a problem which can snowball out of control as more and more emails go unread or unanswered.  At this point in the email, the reader assumes that Kevin's message really demanded a faster response, being personal and timely. Then Cueball reveals that the email is just the ubiquitous LinkedIn invitation. LinkedIn is a professional networking site notorious for inundating its users with emails inviting them to connect to other users (frequently people the user has little-to-no connection to), as well as any email contacts of their users whether or not they actually belong to LinkedIn themselves. Thus, an invitation to connect to LinkedIn is most often immediately deleted or ignored. A less socially anxious person who understands the irrelevance of such an email would not worry about failing to respond to such a request at all, and certainly would not pour his heart out in apology for failing to reply.  The title text continues this, suggesting that Cueball feels not even worthy of the original invitation.  One could interpret the letter as a passive-aggressive lashing out, but that does not seem to be in character for Cueball. Had the character worn a Black Hat though...  Cueball's difficulty in checking his email was previously addressed in 1783: Emails (trivia: the comic numbers 1783 and 1873 are anagrammatic).  This is the fourth comic within a year where Randall uses ""Kevin"" as a go-to-name, although it was half a year since last time in 1795: All You Can Eat. See details in that comics trivia.","[Cueball sits at a desk, typing on a laptop. The following message is displayed above him:]  Dear Kevin,  I'm sorry it's taken me two years to reply to your email. I've built up so much stress and anxiety around my email inbox; it's an unhealthy dynamic which is more psychological than technical. I've tried one magical solution after another, and as each one has failed, deep down I've grown more certain that the problem isn't email – it's me.  Regardless, these are my issues, not yours; you're my friend, and I owe you the basic courtesy of a response. I apologize for my neglect, and I hope you haven't been too hurt by my failure to reply.  Anyway, I appreciate your invitation to join your professional network on LinkedIn, but I'm afraid I must decline..."

For instance, the user may receive a notification if the email body contains wording that suggests a file has been attached, but there is no actual attachment, in order to prevent forgetting to include the intended file in the email.  This comic suggests a similar feature, one which would inform not the user, but the recipient of the message, how long the email has been revised before being sent. This is an expansion of a common feature of collaboration tools used by law firms, and modern word processors such as Microsoft Word 2016.  Randall calls this his nightmare email feature, implying he spends too much time in revision of what should be simple email messages and that making himself, or worse - the recipient, aware of the actual time would make him anxious.  In the shown case it seems that the recipient of the shown e-mail had asked to their latest meeting and asks if he want to do it again this weekend. It then took 47 minutes to write a short reply in which he ends up saying he enjoyed the thing referred to. But alas he has no time this weekend. And then let the other suggest a possible time for a dinner... or something. (Of course there could be more to the email above the panel, but it seems to be a very short answer to another e-mail, and it increases the nightmare for the writer (and the impact of the joke) if this was all that was written in 47 minutes).  If the text had been written out in less than 2 minutes, it would not have been a problem. But it seemed the writer of this e-mail had to think a lot about how it was phrased. This could lead the recipient to wonder what took so long. Was it that he did not enjoy it, but ended up writing this to be nice? He only writes he is busy this weekend, thus not giving any reason as to why. And the last part gives him the possibility to also ""be busy"" on whatever time is suggested for dinner. Also whatever is very non committing. All this is also true if it had been written in 2 minutes, but then at least there would not have been time to think a lot about how the reply was phrased.  The title text describes a similar uncomfortable feature, which would inform the recipient how long a message has been sitting in the user's drafts folder, thus highlighting their procrastination as well as demonstrating that ""(...)didn't see your message until just now"" is a lie, or at least it was only true when the original message was written, and now three days later another message should have been written instead.  Randall has explored a related anxiety-inducing feature of instant messaging in 1886: Typing Notifications.","[A panel with a short email message, with the first line partly obscured by the top of the panel. Below that, in light gray font, is an information message from the email client.] Enjoyed it!

461: Google Maps,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/461:_Google_Maps,computers,Apparently Google assumes you're traveling during the ferry's normal operating hours. We lost two hours circling that damn lake (to say nothing of the Straw Man).,"Google Maps is a web mapping service application. Before smartphones with GPS mapping software were widespread and most people's printers hadn't yet run out of ink, it was common to print out directions to take with you on a trip. The web version of Google Maps has many features including a route planner. As sophisticated as early versions were, it occasionally gave suboptimal directions. For example, the directions may tell you to take an exit that, in reality, is unmarked. Directions also did not take time of day into account which would help in planning routes to avoid traffic or to make use of services such as a ferry.  The title text tells us that Cueball and his brother attempted to drive around the lake since they could not take the ferry and had an unfortunate run-in with the Straw Man (apparently waking him as the directions warned against).  Though no specific game or movie is referenced, steps 75 to 81 of the directions read like the plot of a horror film, a guide of a video game, or a role playing game. A straw man is another term for scarecrow, a common antagonist in both. Step 80 reads exactly like an old text adventure game's description of an area.  There are additional small jokes in the distance column of the directions:  This might be a reference to Google Maps' many easter eggs.","My road trip with my brother ran into trouble around page three of the Google Maps printout  [Google Maps printout.] ← 70.

When Google Maps was first starting out, the maximum zoom level a person could select went past the highest resolution imagery available in certain areas. When this happened, Google Maps would tile the message ""We're sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level"". When Cueball looks ""closely"" enough into Megan's eyes, he sees this same message.  The title text refers to a functionality of Google Maps that allows users to submit/update information about places on the map, such as business listings, monuments, etc. Such updates must be approved by Google before other users can see them. Apparently, Cueball has been repeatedly submitting 'WHERE YOU BROKE MY HEART' as a listing for his own house, so that Megan, who is now on the Google Maps team, will see those submissions.","[Cueball and Megan are talking, and Cueball is walking away from Megan. Megan is holding an open envelope.] Megan: I'm sorry. The Google Maps team hired me. Cueball: But I can't move to California!  Megan: Then I guess this is the end. Cueball: It can't be! ... Listen.

1169: Expedition,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1169:_Expedition,computers,I'm pretty sure I've logged more hours in Google Maps over the past decade than in any game.,"Google Maps is a service provided by Google that offers a map of the world including satellite and aerial imagery for free. Using the scroll wheel, the user can zoom out to see a larger area. Lena River is a river in Russia, flowing into the Arctic Ocean (with a large delta).  Clicking on the comic leads to an online Google Maps page showing the satellite imagery of the Lena Delta.  It appears that Cueball is simply trying to explore the world without leaving his laptop or purchasing an expensive game.  Alternatively, he may be playing Mapcrunch, this 'game' randomizes a street view location with the goal of finding the airport.   The title text states that he apparently somewhat still treats it as a game and that he has been on it for at least a decade.","[Cueball at a computer.] February 4th: Departed the mouth of the Lena River, heading south.

1204: Detail,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1204:_Detail,computers,"2031: Google defends the swiveling roof-mounted scanning electron microscopes on its Street View cars, saying they 'don't reveal anything that couldn't be seen by any pedestrian scanning your house with an electron microscope.'","Google Earth is a mapping software service provided by Google that allows people to view the Earth from above. If zoomed in to maximum magnification, one can obtain clear views of individual streets and homes.  An image's resolution is the smallest length detectable in that image. In terms of Google Earth, this refers to the real-life distance corresponding to one pixel in an aerial image. Randall points out that the level of detail in Google Earth's images has been increasing exponentially since its introduction, as aerial imaging technology improves and better ways of collecting the data are found. Each tick in the scale represents a resolution improvement by 1000 times.  In quantum mechanics, the Planck length is (in layman's terms) the smallest measurable distance, defined as approximately 1.6×10−35 meters, or around 1020 times smaller than the diameter of a proton. As the graph indicates, this may be called the ""resolution"" of the universe.  Randall extrapolates the exponential trend of Google Earth's increasing resolution, 'revealing' that by the year 2120 or so, Google Earth's resolution will approach and even possibly exceed the Planck length, an obviously fanciful and impossible idea. Current laboratory instruments cannot even get close to measuring the Planck length, barely able to reach the level of the atom. (Which, by the chart's prediction, will be surpassed by Google Earth at around 2040.)  Other comics exploring unwarranted extrapolation include 605: Extrapolating, 1007: Sustainable and 1281: Minifigs.  The title text refers to controversy that Google received at one point regarding their use of vehicle-mounted Street View cameras to take images of streets and houses, and how such photography could constitute an invasion of privacy. Google defended itself by stating that the cameras can see nothing more than a pedestrian walking by. Given the trendline in this comic however, Google would need to produce resolution in the nanometer range by 2031, which (using today's technology) would require the use of scanning electron microscopes. The same 'invasion of privacy' defense would obviously not work here, as 1) current scanning electron microscopes in labs can only be used with small specimens at very close range, and are completely unsuitable for observing something as large as a house or for observations from a passing car, and 2) most pedestrians are not equipped with scanning electron microscopes. [citation needed]","My Neighborhood's Resolution in: [A two-axis graph with years from 2000 to 2100 plotted on the x-axis and resolution from 1 meter to the Planck length plotted on a logarithmic scale on the y-axis. Three points in a line close to (~2010, 1 meter) are plotted at the bottom left of the graph; they have a strong positive correlation. Two trendlines are drawn on the graph; one is labeled ""Earth"" and remains constant at the Planck length over time; the other is labeled ""Google Earth"" and connects the aforementioned three points, extending upward in a straight line and approaching the Planck length around 2100. Both trendlines break up into question marks before the point they would intersect.]"

Randall thus publishes his own potentially embarrassing searches. All of his searches relate to his fear of dinosaurs as a consequence of Jurassic Park. The search ""Utahraptor"" may be a reference to Dinosaur Comics, which XKCD has parodied in 145: Parody Week: Dinosaur Comics. Alternatively, ""Utahraptor"" may be referenced because the raptors portrayed in Jurassic Park were much more like utahraptors than velociraptors in terms of size.  The title text refers to a document posted on a humor site: link (part 1) link (part 2), link (part 3).","Cueball: In solidarity with the many AOL users whose often embarrassing web searches were released to the public, I offer a sample of my own search history: [There is a screencap of Google's front page with the following entries suggested for autocompletion below the search box:] velociraptors site:imdb.com ""jurassic park"" raptors dromaeosaurids utahraptor ""home depot"" deadbolts security home improvement surviving a raptor attack robert bakker paleontologist robert bakker ""possible raptor sympathizer"" site:en.wikipedia.org surviving a raptor attack learning from mistakes in jurassic park big-game rifles tire irons treating raptor wounds do raptors fear fire how to make a molotov cocktail do raptors fear death can raptors pick locks how to tell if my neighbors are raptors."

1256: Questions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1256:_Questions,computers,To whoever typed 'why is arwen dying': GOOD. FUCKING. QUESTION.,"Google, a rather popular internet search engine, has a feature known as autocomplete that guesses at search queries before they are fully typed out. These guesses are generally made based on popular searches by other people. From time to time, a particularly strange or hilarious one may be found, as is evidenced in this comic.  The largest pictured questions are: ""Why are there slaves in the bible"" and ""Why are there ants in my laptop"".  All of the questions in the comic are ""why"" questions, so many of them are predicated on false assumptions, such as ""Why are there pyramids on the moon"". All these questions and many more (33,171 in total) can be found in http://xkcd.com/why.txt.  Regarding the title text: in the Peter Jackson films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Arwen becomes sickly for unspecified reasons as the plot advances, apparently giving Aragorn a more personal reason to fight. The only explanation given is by Elrond, who says ""As Sauron's power grows, her [Arwen's] strength wanes."" This subplot is entirely absent from the original novels.

1444: Cloud,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1444:_Cloud,computers,Cloud computing has a ways to go.,"Cueball and Megan are lying outside on the grass and looking up at the clouds. Cueball asks Megan what she thinks a particular cloud looks like, following the common human activity of pareidolia, or spotting apparent patterns where there are none (particularly in clouds).  Rather than responding with her own interpretation, Megan takes a picture of the cloud with her phone, and uses Google's Search by Image feature. In this feature, the user uploads an image rather than providing a keyword to search on, and is presented with suggestions about the subject of the original image. Google's search results reveal that the image Megan uploaded is most probably a photograph of a cloud. While indisputable, this does not address the fanciful dimension of Cueball's original question, and highlights the continuing limitations of artificial intelligence with respect to human imagination.  Google image search works by creating a mathematical model of the shapes and colors in the uploaded image, and matching this against images already in its index. Web page analysis then allows Google to guess at what the image is, based on the content of the pages where the matching images were found. Although apparently unimaginative, even humorously so, Google image search does recognize that the subject of Megan's photograph is a cloud, which is an achievement that has so far eluded programmers. This was the subject of 1425: Tasks.  If the term ""cloud computing"" is taken entirely literally, and purely in the context of this comic, then the title text merely comments that the processing of an image of a cloud for queries is not at an advanced state yet. It is really, however, a pun on cloud computing, which is a trendy term for the modern tendency of providing massive amounts of digital storage and distributed computing power over the Internet. In this context, the term ""cloud"" is a metaphor for the way the details of where or how the storage or processing is done are obscured from the user, as if it all takes place inside a cloud. In 2014, cloud computing as a commonly accessible service really is in its relative infancy, being a 21st-century phenomenon, although the concept goes back decades. Java was originally marketed in the 1990s by Sun Microsystems with the slogan ""the network is the computer"", and the mantra of technologies for distributed computing such as CORBA, EJB and SOAP was ""data first"" and ""the computer is the network"".[1]  In a way, every conceivable sense of the term cloud computing is utilized in Google's image search for Megan's cloud image. Cloud computing is also referenced in 908: The Cloud and 1117: My Sky.  It might be interesting to note that the month before, in September 2014, Google employees had published work on image recognition and pattern-enhancing algorithms. Originally conceived to allow better enlargements of small pictures and the objects contained in them, the process could be tweaked to overemphasize weak structures in pictures, leading to DeepDream images, which literally did start to ""see"" distinct, known structures (mostly dogs) even in random noise. This is rather similar to the pastime of looking for known objects in clouds.  Cueball and Megan are again seen cloudwatching in 1899: Ears.","[Cueball and Megan are lying outside on their backs.] Cueball: What do you think that cloud looks like?

325: A-Minus-Minus,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/325:_A-Minus-Minus,computers,You can do this one in every 30 times and still have 97% positive feedback.,"Black Hat is trying to make the world a weirder place by shipping bobcats to his eBay buyers. Ordinarily, negative feedback is used to warn future buyers about sellers that ship broken products or post misleading listings. In this case, the unfortunate buyer is leaving feedback warning future buyers that Black Hat ships bobcats instead of the actual products, though ""would not buy again"" seems to be a rather feeble response to the replacement. This appears to have been a continuing project, as Cueball receives random packages a year and a half later (576: Packages). Four years later, it is shown that you can blackmail Black Hat into not sending you a bobcat (837: Coupon Code). This comic is also referenced in a popular Amazon review for Randall Munroe's book, What If: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.  Like the weak ""would not buy again"" comment is a play on the stock ""would buy again"" comment often found in positive eBay feedback, the title ""A-Minus-Minus"" is a play on the frequent comment ""A++"".  That in turn, sometimes with varying numbers of pluses, seems to be an easy way people use to pad the end of an eBay comment field to the maximum 80 characters. It's also a reference to jokes in which exceptionally good schoolwork is graded with extra pluses after an A+ (and exceptionally bad work is graded with large numbers of minuses after an F). And finally, it's also a subtle reference to the Futurama episode A Big Piece of Garbage; at one point in that episode, Wernstrom, as an act of petty revenge, gives Farnsworth ""the worst grade imaginable"": an A-minus-MINUS.   The title text is about a flaw in eBay's feedback system: You can intentionally do nasty things to your buyers and get very bad reviews, but still have overall high feedback scores as long as you don't do it too often. (See also 937: TornadoGuard, which shows a different flaw in the concept of averaging reviews—namely that five-star reviews for aesthetic qualities are weighted equally to one-star reviews for major functional deficits—and 1098: Star Ratings, which addresses the topic as well.) These reviews would be disregarded by future customers as well for their weirdness.",[Black Hat is packing a bobcat into a box; Megan stands beside him.]  Megan: What are you doing?

1036: Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1036:_Reviews,computers,"I plugged in this lamp and my dog went rigid, spoke a sentence of perfect Akkadian, and then was hurled sideways through the picture window. Even worse, it's one of those lamps where the switch is on the cord.","Cueball and Megan are shown shopping for lamps. In the first part of the comic (only first frame) it is at a time before online reviews could be looked up on a smartphone. They spot a lamp they like, check the price and agree to buy, end of story.  But the rest of the comic shows how difficult shopping has become after reviews have become easily accessible on smartphones while standing in the store. And now this takes up the final three panels, with the result that no lamps have been acquired and they decide to sit in the dark, using the claim that their living room looks fine in the dark to avoid buying a very expensive lamp which is the only one with perfect reviews (like 100% with 5 stars out of 5).   When shopping for anything via reviews, whether it be electronics or even something as simple as lamps like the comic demonstrates, one negative review can spoil a lot of positive reviews. That hits home even more if the review is specific, because humans attach more weight to anecdotes and specific stories. This comic points out the absurdity of paying attention to those reviews, by making the negative review itself absurd (a lamp making your cats go deaf and interfering with your taste buds would imply, at the very least, anomalous radiation, and would not be on store shelves long before some kind of serious recall).   The second part of the comic starts out normal. For the lamp Cueball think is pretty Megan finds lots of negative reviews which implies the product really isn't good after all, and it was even that specific brand of lamps in general that was to be avoided. But then the proceeds to get more and more absurd all the way to the title text. Cueball is for instance looking at  a lamp who someone thinks looks like a uterus. As normal people do not really know how a uterus looks like, and if Cueball did not find this so himself, he should ignore one persons comment. On the other hand reading such a statement will maybe make you think of a uterus every time you see the lamp. So now it may be best not to buy it, but had he not read the comment it might have been a fine lamp for him.  In the final frame Cueball has found a Swiss lampmaker with perfect reviews, but her lamps are very expensive, the most cheap are staring at 1,300 francs. Swiss francs are the units of currency used in Switzerland. In 2012 when the comic was released a Swiss franc was a little more worth than one dollar (1.1$ to a Swiss Franc) making the cheapest lamp go for not much less than US$1450. For comparison, US$15 can get one a decent lamp at IKEA. Furthermore the lampmaker lives in the Swiss Alps and can only be reached via a ski lift. This either indicated that transportation will be very expensive on top of the high starting price or it may even indicate that they will have to go to the lampmaker personally to either acquire a lamp or maybe just to check out that they really do not look like a uterus or other parts of the human reproductive system...  In the title text, the language spoken by the dog, Akkadian, is an extinct Semitic language that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia.  Even if the dog actually did speak a sentence of perfect Akkadian, the chance that the owner would be able to recognize it as such is negligible. But apart from that the dog first went rigid and after delivering the line it was hurled out the picture window. The final joke it that the worst part of this lamp, was not the above mentioned crazy effects on the dog, but that the lamp had, completely normally, the switch on the cord, as opposed to having it on the body of the lamp. A production argument about where to place such a switch, leading to someone getting fired, was part of the joke in 1741: Work.","[Cueball and Megan stand in a store looking at a lamp that Cueball points at on a table in front of them. There is another table behind them with another lamp and next to it stands a box with a picture of yet a different type of lamp in the bottom right corner. Both lamps have a prize tag dangling from their shade. Above them (and their spoken text) is a frame with a caption:] Shopping before online reviews: Cueball: This lamp is pretty. Megan: And affordable. Cueball: Let's get it. Megan OK!   [Exactly the same setting as above except now Megan holds up her smartphone in one hand looking down at it while typing on it with the other hand. Above them (and their spoken text) is a frame with a caption:] Shopping now: Cueball: This lamp is pretty. Megan: It's got 1½ stars on Amazon. Reviews all say to avoid that brand.  [To the left of Cueball there is another lamp on a table. But he is now looking at his smartphone instead. Megan has turned away from him but is also looking at her smartphones.

Cueball: What about- ...no, review points out it resembles a uterus.  [Cueball is holding hos smartphone up in front of his face, Megan, looking at him, is holding her smartphone but has her arms down.

1098: Star Ratings,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1098:_Star_Ratings,computers,"I got lost and wandered into the world's creepiest cemetery, where the headstones just had names and star ratings. Freaked me out. When I got home I tried to leave the cemetery a bad review on Yelp, but as my hand hovered over the 'one star' button I felt this distant chill...","This comic deals with the idea that user-generated online star ratings are usually heavily biased towards the best possible rating (five stars).  Because we instinctively read a rating of five stars as five points, a three star rating (3/5) seems like a good rating. However, as the lowest possible rating is typically one star, and not zero stars, a 3/5 is the median, and is equivalent to 10/20 - not a great rating.   Furthermore, since ratings are more likely to be given by people who fall onto one of the extremes (either loved or hated the product), there is a tendency for ratings to be skewed either high or low. Fake reviews are also a factor that often push an aggregate score higher, although this is not addressed in the comic.  For these reasons, Randall suggests a way to read these ratings, which is to consider the four star rating the median value (""OK""), and everything below as a ""crap"" rating.  See also: 937: TornadoGuard, another comic about star ratings.  No product is so perfect that every user will give it five stars. So the only explanation for a five star rating is that only a few users have voted, maybe only one.  The title text may refer to the folkloric practice of attributing a feeling of a chill to someone walking on your future grave. When Randall is back home he would like to give a bad rating on Yelp — a corporation that operates an ""online urban guide"" — and hovering his hand over the 'one star' button, he was just 'walking' over the rating on his own future grave.  Another possible explanation for the title text is that the headstones are from people that gave the cemetery low-star ratings and were then murdered, having their given ratings displayed in the headstones. This in turn would explain the chill Randall feels before clicking the one-star button.",Understanding online star ratings:  5 stars: [Has only one review] 4.5 stars: Excellent 4 stars: OK 3.5-1 star: Crap.
1803: Location Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1803:_Location_Reviews,computers,"Google and Yelp keep deleting my scathing reviews of the Mariana Trench, the Chernobyl reactor core, the jet stream, and the equator.","Many online advertising services and social media networks (like Google and Yelp, both mentioned in the title text, and for instance Facebook) allow users to leave reviews of stores, businesses and locations. For various reasons these sites often find themselves with pages dedicated to, as Randall puts it, ""places that really don't need reviews"" such as municipal works installations, government property, and natural landmarks. This naturally attracts both clueless people and lots of self-styled comedians leaving less-than-helpful comments on such review pages.   Randall is just poking fun at this phenomenon by inventing possible reviews for the (fictional) location Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility, depicted with a Google Maps-styled map page along with a series of so-called reviews. (There does exist a Canyon River located in Ontario/Canada and one in Washington/USA (the latter is a significant tributary to the Satsop River). Canada does not maintain nuclear weapons since 1984, so the launch site should be located in Washington).   See explanations for the 11 visible (out of 22) reviews in the table below. Of course those responsible for such a facility with nuclear missiles would not like the attention they would be getting in this way, especially not when one of the comments mentions a hole in the fence... Although this comic makes a joke about reviews it has chosen a very dangerous facility to joke about. See more about this under Politics below  In the title text Randall mentions that both Google and Yelp keep deleting his scathing reviews of several locations like the above. The questions is if they would have done it if they had not been so harsh... While Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility appears not to exist, the places/phenomena he lists in the title text certainly do, and are places that you either cannot or would not normally visit as destinations. Here below each ""location"" is explained. That the deletion of such reviews is real has been proven by this comic, as it also happened for those that (of course) posted these reviews on Google maps as a response to this comic.  Mariana Trench is the deepest area of the world's oceans, about 10,994 meters (36,070 ft) deep, located between Japan and Australia. The pressure in the Mariana Trench is about 1,086 bars, more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure of about 1 bar at sea level. Despite this enormous pressure some organisms live in the Mariana Trench. Humans can reach the ground only by special deep-sea submarines, like Jacques Piccard did in 1960 with the Bathyscaphe Trieste. See reviews for the Mariana Trench at Google Maps and Facebook.  The Chernobyl reactor core is the most dangerous part of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It is located in the North of Ukraine. In the reactor No. 4 there was a nuclear disaster that happened on 26 April 1986. It caused devastating damage and massive radioactive contamination. There is still a Chernobyl Exclusion Zone 30 kilometers around the power plant. See reviews for the Chernobyl power plant at Google Maps and Facebook.  Jet streams are a meteorologic phenomenon about 9 to 16 kilometers above the ground. A stream consists of air currents with speeds from 92 km/h (50 kn; 57 mph) to over 398 km/h (215 kn; 247 mph). Such jet streams are routinely used for reducing fuel usage for long distance plane travels. As it is a ribbon rather than a point, it could not have a single point on the map. Also, the jet stream fluctuates north and south; so even if it could be pinpointed, the location would be constantly changing.  The equator is, as with the jet streams, not a singular place but a circumference around the Earth. Reviewing the equator as a singular location is rather pointless, though there is a whole range of specific (and interesting) locations around the equator, with countries with tropical rainforest climate, which many people from European and North American countries struggle with. That said, most of the equator goes over water.  In the table the rating is given with the review. After that an explanation both of the rating and of the review is given. Notice that any or all of the reviews could be sarcastic or ""trolling"", as is fairly typical on the internet, especially for reviews given for such a location as this one. This table assumes all the reviews are played straight.   The decision to make a comic depicting a nuclear missile launch facility may not be entirely random, given Randall's mildly political mood lately. In particular, it could be due to the cold relationship between Russia and the United States at the time of this comics release. Two weeks prior to this comics release Russia Deploys Missile, Violating Treaty and Challenging Trump. This was less than a month after Donald Trump became president. Trump has been positive towards Vladimir Putin earlier, but after the violation USA condemned the new missile. That Randall was not in favor of Trump becoming president was made clear in 1756: I'm With Her. His predecessor Barack Obama even stated, before Trump was elected, that If Trump can't handle Twitter, then he can't handle nuclear codes. Randall has earlier mentioned the codes indirectly in 1242: Scary Names, where he mentions the Nuclear football, which is much more scary than the name... It is a year ago he finished a ""series"" of four comics in a short period about nuclear weapons with 1655: Doomsday Clock (see about the other comics at the bottom of that explanation). But it seems that recent events have made him think about it again, although he tries no to as made evident in 1796: Focus Knob.","[Inside the main panel there is a frame with a Google location map with the typical red pin stuck in the center of the map inside a large gray region of the map.

1869: Positive and Negative Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1869:_Positive_and_Negative_Reviews,computers,"This restaurant is great! I was feeling really sick, but then I ate there and felt better!","The comic shows customer reviews from people who purchased a made-up sports drink multi-pack containing twelve 20 oz (591 mL) bottles. The people who gave negative reviews are Merlin (the wizard from the legends of King Arthur) and B. Button (from the short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and its film adaptation). Merlin remembers the future; in the T. H. White novel series The Once and Future King, he was born at the wrong end of time and has to live backwards. Benjamin Button was born with the physical appearance of an old man and grows younger as time progresses. In this comic, they apparently perceive time backwards: Merlin was thirsty then he drank the SmartQuench 9000, but he perceived it as drinking and then becoming thirsty. Benjamin Button was dehydrated then drank 3 bottles and got better, but perceived it the other way around.  Particles of matter can have a positive or negative electric charge. Particles have associated antiparticles with opposite charge. For example electrons are negatively charged particles and their antiparticles are positrons, which are positively charged. Antiparticles can be interpreted as if they were the associated particle moving backward in time. Applying that interpretation to customer reviews gives the caption of the comic: positive reviews from people traveling backward in time are negative reviews (the ""antiparticles"" of positive reviews).  The caption seems to say that there are only positive experiences—some going forward, some backward in life. However, Randall gives an example in the title text of a positive review which is actually about a negative experience by a person traveling backward in time (the person ate at a restaurant then got sick). The conclusion is that there are both positive and negative events, but the way they are perceived depends on both the event and whether one sees it going forward or backward in time.","[A picture with four small bottles and a larger one is shown.

146: Join Myspace,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/146:_Join_Myspace,computers,I really shouldn't abuse that power so heavily.,"This comic refers to the 1980s TV-comicseries (and Greeting Card subjects) ""Care Bears,"" in which various cuddly bears in rainbow colors go on missions to save the world. The characters' ultimate weapon is the ""Care Bear Stare,"" in which the Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer that could bring care and joy into the target's heart.  ""Myspace"" is the social networking site myspace.com. Cueball is convincing Black Hat to create an account at this networking site, but Black Hat isn't interested. Then, when Black Hat gets annoyed by Cueball's persuasions, he activates his ""carebearstare,"" thus overthrowing Cueball's request to be friends only.  One possible explanation for Black Hat's odd choice of weaponry is that he is mocking Cueball. The phrase ""Please? I'll friend you"" sounds like an average preschooler's coaxing (along the lines of ""Please? I'll be your friend!""). Therefore, Black Hat may feel that Cueball's remarks seem childish and deserve a childish backlash.  On a nostalgic note, considering the state of social media in the 2010s, Black Hat is just really good at foreshadowing.  In the title text, Black Hat reflects that he uses his carebearstare power too much, possibly as a form of apology to Cueball.","[Cueball is talking to Black Hat.] Cueball: Dude, you should get on MySpace.

239: Blagofaire,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/239:_Blagofaire,computers,Things were better before the Structuring and the Levels.,"Facts become distorted as time moves forward. What do we know about the Elizabethan times? They spoke strange English. What will 400 years from now think of the first twenty years of the Internet? Crazy people said crazy things online. Will we even say ""online"" 400 years from now? Won't the internet be everywhere, and everyone on it all the time in their retinal implants that being ""offline"" will seem absurd?  Particular facts that this reinactor seems to have confused are:  ""Ren Faire"" is short for ""Renaissance Faire"", described as ""an outdoor weekend gathering, usually held in the United States, open to the public and typically commercial in nature, which emulates a historic period for the amusement of its guests.""   While Cory Doctorow is not in this comic, the character is cosplaying him. This comic inspired several xkcd readers to give Cory Doctorow a red cape and goggles when he won the 2007 EFF Pioneer Award. Cory Doctorow's balloon is featured in 482: Height.  The title Blagofaire might be an amalgamation between Blogosphere, Medieval Faire, and Blag, Randall's way of referencing his blog.  The title text is probably the future cosplayer referring to the state of the future internet, indicating some organizational structure that constrains and stratifies it, and his preference for what he perceives as the wild and unfettered internet of the past.  The ""festival"" the cosplayer references is most likely a reference to the blogger reenactment festivals mentioned in 771: Period Speech.","Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Hey, it worked!

300: Facebook,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/300:_Facebook,computers,"Here, I'll put my number in your cell pho -- wait, why is it already here?'","This comic approaches how Social networks have changed the ways of human interaction. With everyone placing their personal interests on their Facebook profile pages, it has become fairly easy to gather a lot of information about people. In the comic, Cueball uses this information to his advantage: He ascertained Megan's musical preferences beforehand in order to create the illusion of their sharing mutual interests. Megan is led to believe that he is like-minded, thus making it easier for Cueball to persuade her into having sex with him. Here the comic takes at the fact that many people use Facebook as a hunting ground for sexual contacts.  Apparently, Megan did not only mention her favorite bands in her profile, but also her preferred sex position. This can be read as a sideswipe at what intimate details some people are willing to share on the internet. Although mentioning sexual preferences is hyperbolic here.  Megan's taste in both fields can be regarded as outside the mainstream.  Regina Spektor and The Polyphonic Spree are representatives of the indie pop genre. The Wheelbarrow (NSFW) features the man standing behind the woman and holding her legs, while she props up in a wheelbarrow-like position. The retrograde variant has the woman facing upwards. Unusual sex positions are also mentioned in comics 414: Mistranslations and 487: Numerical Sex Positions.  The title text suggests that Cueball did not stop at reading Megan's interests on her Facebook profile, but also obtained her phone number and placed it in his phone. It is implied that some of the ""mildly sleazy"" uses of Facebook can border on the verge of stalking. When Megan discovers the number, she may realise this and stay clear of Cueball...","Mildly sleazy uses of Facebook, part 14: Looking up someone's profile before introducing yourself so you know which of your favorite bands to mention Cueball: Favorite bands? Hmm... Cueball: Maybe Regina Spektor or the Polyphonic Spree. Megan: Whoa, those are two of my favorites, too! Megan: Clearly, we should have sex. Cueball: Okay!

355: Couple,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/355:_Couple,computers,"Facebook defines relationships. 'Yeah, we would have broken up last night, but the net connection was down.'","It's hard to know when you are in a relationship in modern times. In olden days you might fancy a girl, and then ask her father if you might court her, and if he granted his permission you would be a couple. Today, that kind of structure and formality is terrifyingly antiquated; as a result we don't have any of the straightforward cues.  This comic suggests that ""making it Facebook official"", which means asserting the existence of a romantic relationship on Facebook by setting one's status to ""In a relationship"", has recently become a way to define when you are a couple. Cueball would like to do it, probably after having sex for the first time with his love interest, to get confidence in his relationship and/or show it off to his friends. Because his love interest isn't so sure about that relationship, or doesn't like to formalize it and prefers to enjoy without thinking too much about it, he suggests a compromise: using the ""It's complicated"" status instead. And he does so with a phrasing very reminiscent of a formal way to propose to marry someone (""Will you be my wife?"").  The title text takes it a step further, suggesting that Facebook has become the only reliable way to know about relationships — even so, without access to Facebook, relationships can't evolve.","[Cueball and Megan in bed.] Cueball: So is this it?

In 2009, it was the origin of the Pandemic H1N1/09 virus, which most news stations called either ""H1N1"" (the subtype name) or ""swine flu"". Because of the ambiguous name given to it and the somewhat hazy description of the transmittal process and dangers to humans, many people were concerned about the virus in ways that weren't going to be threats. This comic pokes a bit of fun at the overreaction by users on Twitter.  Randall (or someone else) seems to have created Twitter accounts for all referenced handles (that may not have already existed). Some of the handles continue their interactions with each other in later tweets.  Skeeve37 is a self-described hypochondriac. The tweet exemplifies the general populace's over-concern with the ""animal themed"" pandemics. Similarly after the bird flu scare, people avoided eating chicken.  Hanneloreec is a self-described ""young lady who is concerned about many things"". She is a reoccurring character in the webcomic Questionable Content by Jeph Jacques, who also manages her twitter handle.  Paulyshorefan's tweet is a reference to the flash game ""Pandemic 2"", in which players try to create a disease that infects the whole world. Madagascar is the most difficult country to infect, as it only has 1 port and often closes it at the slightest hint of an infection. The difficulty of infecting Madagascar has caused it to become a meme.  CrackMonkey74's tweet is a parody of viral Christian(?) messages that say that current tragedies are God's punishment, despite the fact that the Bible says that the end is not yet to come. More specifically, Crackmonkey74 blames the ACLU, lesbians (a reference to the current culture wars that give big press towards proponents of same-sex marriage against fundamentalist Christians), 9/11 (the day when the Twin Towers fell, causing controversy on whether Muslim terrorists crashed their planes on the towers or whether the government staged this by purposefully demolishing the towers) and nanobots (possibly a reference towards the highly promising but still relatively not understood field of nanotechnology, plus another reference towards the phrase ""playing God"").  Twilight7531's tweet implies that she got a bone fracture which ended up protruding from her arm. However, she seems to lack medical knowledge (or intelligence in general, given that her name carries both something that may be a reference toward the infamous Twilight books and a ""gimmicky"" naming scheme (7531 has the numerals of every odd number that is less than 9)), so she is worried that her fracture is actually swine flu (though how she can be typing with a broken arm is confusing).  Wigu's tweet is a reply towards Untoward's. Given the context, Untoward seems to have ""gotten intimate"" with a pig (since syphilis is a venereal disease). Given the fact that Untoward got sick because of a pig, Untoward seems to have concluded that he got swine flu.  The last comment by 2011Seniorsrule references a medical paper published by the journal The Lancet, in which it is proposed that autism is caused by vaccination. Since then, the paper was partially retracted in 2004, and fully retracted in 2010 because of conflicts of interest. The entire incident has been defined as the MMR vaccine controversy. This stance has still been seen since the retraction of the paper, and still holds some popularity. The most famous figure in support of it is Jenny McCarthy.  Also, fear of germs is common among autistic people, so ""licking an autistic kid"" would be a difficult and possibly painful experience.   The title text refers to the common notion that young adults are hard-drinking individuals who get little sleep.

655: Climbing,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/655:_Climbing,computers,Where did you even get this wall? Return it there and stand it back up right now.,"This comic makes fun of a certain type of images very common on the internet. Those pictures are taken with a camera turned by 90° or rotated later by software, thus creating the illusion of people walking on walls or ceilings. While the original pictures depict the physical impossibility of a rotated gravitational force, Cueball uses the aforementioned technique to create pictures of himself on a climbing wall. Megan approaches him from above the wall, indicating that the climbing wall is in fact lying on the floor. It becomes clear that Cueball was not able to climb a real wall and therefore crawled on the floor with his camera adjusted accordingly.  Her comment is a sideswipe on the practise of self-display on Facebook, which is often done with the help of image manipulation.  The title text implies that Cueball has in fact stolen a real climbing wall, and that Megan wants him to return it.","[Cueball seen from his back, as he is ascending a gray climbing wall with 16 white handles in different shapes and sizes. He is standing on one near the bottom left of the panel with his left foot, holding on to a large handle to the left of his head, and one to the right at shoulder height. His right foot is seeking hold on another handle above knee hight of his left leg.]  [Cueball is seen in profile still climbing up the gray wall, which is drawn in the right part of the panel, 13 handles protruding. At the top of the panel something is protruding from the wall at more than ninety degree angle to the wall, as the line soon goes off panel at the top, but it seems to be directed at a small white half circle at the top of the panel. The line begins in front of the last of the handles at the top, a small one, and below this there is a larger handle bending up making it easy to hold on to. Cueball is holding on with his hands to two similar ""easy"" handles.]  [Cueball climbs a bit further up till his hand reaches the up bending handle in front of the line, and his lower leg and upper knee touches the two handles his hands where on before. Here he has stopped climbing and lifts his head back to look up and sees Megan standing there above him (as she was also doing at the top of the previous panel, but cut of at leg and face). She just stands perpendicular to the wall facing down towards Cueball. he panel has paned up following Cueball so there are only 11 handles now, two more visible ""above"" Megan, and four from the previous panel are now below this panels frame.]  [Same scene but Cueball is now looking at the wall as Megan speaks.] Megan: Your Facebook rock climbing pictures just got a lot less impressive."
723: Seismic Waves,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/723:_Seismic_Waves,computers,The USGS operates a really neat email/SMS earthquake notification service (earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/) that allows fine-grained control of notifications.,"One stereotype surrounding Twitter users is that they are more concerned with broadcasting their current status than they are with addressing it. Earthquakes are natural disasters caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, known for the destruction that they leave in their wake. The comic outlines the potential that technology can have in warning people about earthquakes, which is unfortunately negated by the tendency of the typical users of the technology to care more about sharing the warning message than they are to preserve their own lives.  The title text is a geology pun, as ""fine-grained"" is a common term used by geologists to describe rocks.  Real scientists are trying to turn this speed difference into a practical tool. Go figure.","When an earthquake hits, people flood the internet with posts about it-some within 20 or 30 seconds. [A room with a desk, chair, and computer are shaking. The person in it is on his phone, using Twitter.] RobM163 Huge earthquake here!  Damaging seismic waves travel at 3-5km/s. Fiber signals move at ~200,000km/s. (minus network lag)  This means when the seismic waves are about 100km out, they begin to be overtaken by the waves of posts ABOUT them. [There is a geographical border on a map; the front edge of the wave of the quake is shown, with the front edge of the wave of tweets surpassing it.]  People outside this radius may get word of the quake via Twitter, IRC, or SMS BEFORE the shaking hits. [Megan and Cueball are standing, holding cell phones. Megan is looking at hers.] Megan: Whoa! Earthquake!  Sadly, a Twitterer's first instinct is not to find shelter. Megan and Cueball (on phones): RT @RobM163 Huge earthquake here!"
918: Google+,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/918:_Google%2B,computers,"On one hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch. On the other hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch!","At the time of the comic's release, Google+ was a new social network announced by Google on June 28, 2011. When it launched there were many tech articles written about G+, which appears to look and/or function similarly to Facebook. In the first panel, Megan describes G+ as 'not Facebook'. Facebook is a popular social networking site. She then describes G+ as being like Facebook.  After Cueball thinks about it in the second frame, he comes to a realization in the third frame that a social network like Facebook, but not related to Facebook is all he really wanted. This is in reference to the backlash that happens every so often wherein people grow tired of Facebook, its arcane policies, its cavalier attitude toward user privacy and/or its general disdain for end users, and people want to leave Facebook, but have no comparable platform to move their social networking to.  The title text uses ""you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch"" as both point and counterpoint in an argument, since this fact has both negative (your parents won't see posts you want them to see, and won't be able to post things for you to see) and positive (your parents won't see posts you don't want them to see, and you won't have to worry about keeping up with their posts) implications.","Megan: You should join Google+! Cueball: What is it? Megan: Not Facebook! Cueball: What's it like? Megan: Facebook!  [Cueball considers.]  Cueball: Oh, what the hell. Cueball: I guess that's all I really wanted. click"
929: Speculation,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/929:_Speculation,computers,"I was pretty good at skeet shooting, but was eventually kicked off the range for catching the clay pigeons in a net and dispatching them execution-style.'","During a basketball game, the players discuss the nature of universal conformity. Facebook and Google+ are competing social networks, at the time of this comic many people were switching to Plus over Facebook leading many to speculate that Facebook was in decline and that Plus would soon be the dominant social network. (Incidentally, as of 2017, it seems that Facebook has successfully held its position as the Default Social Network™, while Plus has largely become known as ""that thing YouTube tried to make us all sign up for once"".)  The two players seem to have a disagreement over this. One player states that it would be ridiculous to expect everyone to move to Plus. The other player denies the notion that they have to, valuing his personal preference over conformity. He supports this by saying that his mother still uses AOL and other people continue using IRC, if each time a new dominant social network emerged and everyone switched to it neither of these things would stick around.  They are interrupted when they pass the ball to Black Hat who immediately shoots it with a crossbow bolt. Their arguments and rather intelligent discussion are derailed by the absurdity of Black Hat's reaction which is both humorous and puts the issue in stark contrast.  Black Hat neither joins in the discussion nor does he participate in the game and it seems that any offer to participate in either is met with a blunt and clear denial. He is simply not a conformist.  In the title text Black Hat continues to provide an example of his tendency to play by his own rules. A clay pigeon is a clay disc that is thrown into the air and serves as a target on a skeet shooting range. Participants are expected to shoot the pigeons with a shotgun but Black Hat would rather capture the clay pigeons and shoot them from a very close range. This is made even more humorous by the excellent crossbow skills he shows in the comic. This practice eventually got him expelled from the shooting range.","[Two Cueball-like guys are playing basketball. The right guy (Cueball) attempts to throw the basketball through the hoop, but it bounces off down to his friend. To the right Black Hat has his back to the other two while he is looking at his phone.] Friend: Do you seriously think everyone will move to Plus? It was hard enough getting them on Facebook.  [The friend has caught the rebound and now passes the basketball back to Cueball. Black Hat is not shown.] Cueball: Do they have to? Cueball: My mom still uses AOL—it doesn't mean my social life has to happen there.  [Only Cueball is shown. He passes the basketball to the right towards the off-pannel Black Hat.] Cueball: Universal adoption isn't everything. I mean, IRC is still—  [Zoom in on the basketball as an arrow pierces the ball.] Thunk  [Cueball looks to Black Hat who has a crossbow in one hand, he is still looking at the phone in his other hand. The ball with the arrow lies between them.] Cueball: You're not really the ""catch"" type, are you? Black Hat: I am not."
935: Missed Connections,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/935:_Missed_Connections,computers,The Street View van isn't going to find out anything Google won't already know from reading my email.,"Missed Connections is a page on Craigslist in which people who saw each other briefly and want to reconnect attempt to find each other again. In the case of missed connections, one person describes themselves ""Me"" and describes the other person ""You"" in order that the second person would recognize themself and try to reconnect.  The first entry appears to be a goofy joke, although there have been many Wienermobile incidents in the past. Given the timing of this comic, one can't help but wonder if it might also be a pun referencing the then recent resignation of Rep. Anthony Weiner over tweeting pictures of his, well, wiener with his mobile device.  The second entry refers to a person (you) looking down into a wishing well (presumably to throw in a coin to get a wish), but someone (me) is sitting down in the well with a harpoon looking up spotting the silhouette at the top of the well. This seems like a very weird thing to do, and the vaguely human shadow may be lucky to be alive, since the only reason the ""you"" should know about the ""me"" is if the me fired the harpoon (and missed). A person sitting in a well telling people stuff (as if it was the well speaking) was the pun in 568: Well 2. Oddly enough, this entry could possibly be a reference to this episode of The Fairly OddParents.  The third entry is a reference to networking. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. UDP packets don't use handshaking to verify they have contacted the correct host, so they can get lost or confused. The Cisco router location is a block of IP addresses that was unallocated at the time when this comic was published but has been allocated to Latin America and Caribbean since then. Cisco is a company that makes networking equipment. This is a play on a missed connection for someone who was lost and asked for directions.  The fourth entry is a reference to two events in 2011 in which President Barack Obama invited rappers--among other people--to the White House. After each event, right-wing commentators blasted the event as a party unbecoming of the dignity of the White House. Nancy Pelosi is the Democratic Leader of the US House of Representatives. The acronym (D-CA) is a common notation for politicians which notates party (D for Democrat) and state (CA for California). Pelosi would have also been invited to these events, and the missed connections listing is a reference to what the commentators imagined the event would have been like. A ""juggalo"" is a term referring to a fan of the rap group Insane Clown Posse (which includes rapper Violent J), which is notorious for having wild, misogynistic and violent fanbase.  The fifth entry is a straightforward joke. One of the two people getting married was so distracted by their phone they have no clue where their spouse is now, or even who they are. Alternatively, it could be that the second party deserted the wedding because they were frustrated by their partner being distracted by their cell phone during the wedding, and the first partner is now hoping to convince them to return.  The sixth entry is a reference to how the Google Street View car was not only recording photos of the street in 360 degrees, it was also collecting data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. The comic takes this to the next level, that the Google Street View van also scans what we have in our pockets and does a retinal scan. In this case, the social security number referenced is the most used SSN of all time. The retinal scan takes this even further, indicating that Google's cameras are collecting fine enough images to identify people by Retinal scan.  The entry gets a bit absurd when you realize with all this data, it should be trivial for the Google employee to ID and meet this young man, and would not need the Missed Connections page.  The last entry suggests that Babe Ruth, the American baseball slugger of 1914-1935, is actually a Time Lord. Time Lord is a reference to the popular sci-fi series Doctor Who in which The Doctor, who is a Time Lord, uses a TARDIS, which is a time travel machine. Possibly because he was a baseball player ""ahead of his time"".  The title text is another reference to the privacy concerns surrounding Google Street View van, to which Google responded by claiming that the street view camera wouldn't capture anything that someone walking by wouldn't be able to see. Randall is not worried about the street view van since he expects that Google will already know anything that such a van could discover from reading his e-mails. This last statement is of course much more serious that having a photo taken by a passing van, thus making it clear what people should fuss about, and it is not the van.","[The page is set up like the missed connections area of Craigslist, with a list of messages from an individual to a person they weren't able to communicate with at the time. All readable text is in blue. There is a large heading at the top:] Personals > Missed Connections  [Below the heading there is a gray section in a black frame with two lines.

The second line has three check boxes and two other boxes, all empty. all boxes has white background. Text is written many places around these boxes (and on the drop down menu), it is written in black, but none of it is readable.]  [Below this gray section follows seven missed connections, the last being cut before the description of ""Me"" is finished, and the line visible is cut of, so the lower third of the letters are hidden below the comics frame.]  You: Clinging to hood of your stolen Wienermobile, trying to reach into engine to unstick throttle Me: Screaming, diving out of the way  You: Vaguely human silhouette Me: At bottom of wishing well with harpoon gun  You: Confused UDP packet Me: Cisco router in 45.170/16 block  You: Baddest fuckin' Juggalo at Violent J's party Me: Nancy Pelosi (D-Ca)  You: Getting married to me Me: Also getting married, but distracted by my phone  You: Cute boy on corner of 4th & Main, 5'11, 169lbs, social security number 078-05-1120, pockets contained $2.09 in change, keys, and a condom.

The phrase that Cueball used to use when he heard a random phrase was ""would be a good name for a band."" With the advent of Tumblr, his go-to response has shifted because of the proliferation of Tumblr blogs with strange names.  Raccoon Sex Dungeon is an actual Tumblr page. See trivia below.  In the title text he muses on the fact that Dot Tumblr Dot Com would be an awful band name. There could be several reasons for this, but he mentions that it would be hard to direct fans to the band's website. As an example, someone who hears ""www.thedottumblrdotcom.com"" might instead write it out as ""www.the.tumblr.com.com"" since '.' is often pronounced as ""dot."" If the band's website was hosted on Tumblr, then their website would be ""dottumblrdotcom.tumblr.com"".  Raccoons are also feature in a disgusting situations in 1565: Back Seat.","[Megan and Cueball are talking.] Megan:  You know those weird noises from my attic?

1034: Share Buttons,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1034:_Share_Buttons,computers,The only post to achieve perfect balance between the four was a hilarious joke about Mark Zuckerberg getting caught using a pseudonym to sneak past the TSA.,"This comic is a commentary on what sort of articles work best on different social networking services. From left to right the share buttons are: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google+.  The title text humorously combines appealing subjects for all four networks:","[A series of article titles with four share buttons underneath each: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google+]  Breaking Into Stand-up Comedy FB: 3, Twitter: 1,781, Reddit: 2, G+: 0  How the Christian Right Threatens Wikipedia FB: 1, Twitter: 0, Reddit: 2,241, G+: 3  Boycott Facebook Today!

1045: Constraints,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1045:_Constraints,computers,[title-text similarly alphabetized],"An epigram is a brief, interesting, usually memorable and sometimes surprising or satirical statement. Constrained writing is an age-old literary phenomenon, where writers impose rules or patterns in their works. Haiku is a well known example of this.  Twitter is a short message social network and communication service. All messages (known as tweets) on the service need to be under 140 characters. Until August 2015 even private messages had that restriction. Twitter is frequently used by well-known comedians as a place to make interesting jokes and observations.  All the words spoken by Megan, from ""Yeah"" to ""alphabetization"", are in reverse alphabetical order. Here are the starting letters (with extra letter when more than one word in a row begins with the same letter):   It both answers Cueball's question and exemplifies with an ingenious self-reference, while being short enough (133 characters) to be a valid tweet — hence the ""whoa.""  The title text, ""title-text similarly alphabetized"", is also backwards-alphabetized and self-referential. Starting letters:","[Cueball sits in an office chair at his computer desk, motioning toward the screen with a hand as Megan stands behind him.] Cueball: I don't get why authors and comedians spend so much energy trying to be clever on Twitter. Couldn't they put that creativity into more books and scripts?  Cueball: Is there something they like about the 140-character format?  [Same picture but in a frame-less panel, except Cueball has taken his arm down.] Megan: Yeah. Writers working under tight restrictions produce novel material—like, for example, epigrams employing backward alphabetization.  [A slim panel with only Cueball at his computer desk shown.] Cueball: ...Whoa."
1057: Klout,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1057:_Klout,computers,"Though please do confirm that it's actually *me* on Klout first, and not one of my friends trying to get me punched. The great thing about this douchebag deadman switch is that I will never dare trigger it.","Klout is a site that seeks to measure your ""influence"" on social media networks. They sometimes give away ""perks"" to the users with the highest Klout scores, as a means of advertising the products of their sponsors. Generally, the information provided by Klout is not held in high esteem. The type of person who takes most interest in their score is typically not well-liked.  There are multiple ways that Klout measures your influence. An example of increasing influence is having been given a +K (a recommendation for a higher score) for knowledge about ""Pitbull"" (The Bud Light promoter and producer/rapper/musician, etc., not the type of dog). Another could be having an inspiring tweet that generated 2000 retweets. Klout supports many social networks, and ranks people based primarily on how much reaction they garner from the public. For example, if Selena Gomez tweeted that she simply loved a certain blog, she would probably get more people to visit that blog, and thus get a bigger Klout score, than if the mayor of Anchorage, Alaska tweeted that he liked that blog. Or xkcd publishing a comic about Klout would lead to an all time high in Google searches for it. However, their ""about us"" page does claim that a small, active group of followers is considered more influential than a large, passive group of followers.  The gist of the comic is that Cueball (here representing Randall) does not feel that Klout agrees with his core values, probably as he prefers self-assurance to having an outside authority tell him of his importance to society. He uses this comic to give himself incentive to stay away from Klout. He is very clear that he is dead serious about anyone meeting him after he has (been proven to have) used Klout should punch him in the face. He even makes sure that he cannot later retract this statement, if he for instance becomes interested in Klout (something he never wish for). Because his last statement is that people should ignore anything he says to retract this statement later.  Randall will now have a problem though because since he also posted the 706: Freedom comic earlier, he will never knows if people that hit him does because they believe he has used Klout or just to exercise their free will.   In the title text a ""dead man's switch"" is any mechanism which is designed to activate if the user does not take any action. This is generally used to create a failsafe in case the user is incapacitated  For example, many exercise treadmills include a tether meant to connect the runner to the machine's base station. If the runner gets too far from the base station, the tether pulls a pin and the machine stops immediately. This way, if the runner has fallen or is struggling to keep up, the machine does not exacerbate an already unsafe situation. Randall's ""douchebag deadman switch"" is a variation that would trigger if he ever became enough of an asshole to use Klout. This would lead to him being constantly punched in the face, so he doesn't dare become that type of person.  Shortly after this comic was posted, a Klout user was created claiming to be Randall. This was a fake, so if you ever meet Randall in real life, please don't punch him.","[Randall has drawn himself as Cueball in a slim panel:] Randall: I'd like to ask a favor.  Randall: If someday, in the future, we meet in person,  [Zoom out of Randall talking.] Randall: And if, as of that day, I've interacted with Klout in any way except to opt out,  Randall: I want you to punch me in the face without warning.  [Zoom in on Randall's head.] Randall: This may sound like a joke, so let me be clear:  Randall: I am dead serious.  Randall: Ignore anything I say retracting this.  Randall: Thank you."
1085: ContextBot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1085:_ContextBot,computers,"If you read all vaguebooking/vaguetweeting with the assumption that they're saying everything they can without revealing classified military information, the internet gets way more exciting.","This comic is a commentary on the practice of ""vaguebooking"" or ""vaguetweeting"", which is posting a short message of sadness or frustration without context.    Google has been criticized more than a few times for keeping rather extensive data records on its users, who by this point constitute most of the internet, enough to cause serious damage if Google wasn't historically altruistic (as altruistic as a for-profit company can be). In the comic, ContextBot is a fictitious Google invention which puts context for these statuses, presumably based on all that personal data which Google has collected:  As noted by the subtitle, ContextBot is considered a great good by everyone who was sick of vaguebooking. This also redeems Google's practice of all those data records in the public's eye.  In the ContextBot's avatar image, three people can be seen together hanging out. But the image is about to be cropped, leaving out the third person and therefore giving the impression that the two people in the cropped image are there without that person. This demonstrates how context is important to understanding a situation.  The title text refers to the cryptic ways in which someone with sensitive information must communicate. While most vaguebooking/vaguetweeting is about things of little importance, the title text implies that the things not mentioned impact national/global security. This implies that many tweets may actually be related to high-clearance military and or national security information, but must be vague in order to keep it secret, and if you take that as the context, then the internet suddenly becomes much more exciting.","[A social network feed with four status updates from four different people. Each one has a reply from the same account, which is called 'ContextBot', underneath.] Close-up face with glasses: The things I put up with... ContextBot: (His building's WiFi doesn't reach the bathroom.) Male female couple: You'd think by now I'd have learned never to trust anyone. ContextBot: (She downloaded a torrent that turned out to be an encrypted .rar and a link to a survey.) Blonde girl with bangs: I officially give up.

1150: Instagram,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1150:_Instagram,computers,"I'm gonna call the cops and get Chad arrested for theft, then move all my stuff to the house across the street. Hopefully the owners there are more responsible.","As indicated by the title, this comic is an allegory for a controversy over Instagram, a photo-sharing social network now owned by Facebook. In December 2012, Instagram changed their terms of use, allowing the network to sell user-uploaded images, without profit to the content generators. This infuriated many users, who closed their accounts or stopped uploading images.  In the comic Cueball tells his Cueball-like friend about his problem with Chad, who just send him a note telling him that he no longer wants to store all this stuff that Cueball has left in his garage. Cueball left it there because Chad has nice shelves and lets him in to see his stuff whenever he wishes, so that was really convenient.  Chad's note tells Cueball that he has a month to move his shit - after that he will try to get rid of it by selling it on Craigslist. This is a website where individuals can contact others interested in buying or selling goods. As a verb, it means to sell something on Craigslist. (FYI is an abbreviation of  For Your Information).   Cueball is outraged, as this is not way to run a storage business. But when his friend asks him if he paid anything for this ""storage business"" it turns out that he did not. The friend then concludes that it is not a storage business.   This is exactly the problem with Instagram (or its users). A user does not pay anything, but to create an account you have to sign a terms of service/end user license agreement. A user has thus effectively signed their consent to whatever Instagram has written. Instagram can then change these terms if they give a forewarning (as Chad has done here). Unfortunately, most users don't read the terms before clicking the ""I agree"" option, so it can come as a shock when Instagram uses the data in a way the user hadn't anticipated.   Instead of getting angry Cueball should thus just go and remove his stuff, but instead he is just going to almost (but not quite) stop giving Chad any more stuff.   This is also making fun of those Instagram users that complain about the new way of using their data, but at the same time keep uploading more pictures. The users have often developed a kind of addiction, so they cannot just stop sharing their life (in pictures).  In the title text Cueball continues with an idea of calling the cops. He thinks that Chad is a thief. He thus ignores that he left the stuff at Chad's house of his own accord. And after Chad has been arrested (which will of course never happen) he wishes to move all his stuff to another house, just to continue to get free storage.   There are two major flaws in this logic - and it is the same with the logic of the disgruntled Instagram users. You cannot accuse Instagram of stealing because it was you who gave them the images in the first place, and it is irresponsible to assume that this will not happen if you give your photos to another social networking company (like Facebook).  These kind of issues (with Facebook as the evildoer) are also the subject of 743: Infrastructures and 1390: Research Ethics.","[Cueball, raising a hand, is talking to his Cueball-like friend who is sitting by his computer.] Cueball: I've been putting all my stuff in Chad's garage. Cueball: He has nice shelves. Cueball: And he lets me in to see it whenever I want.  [In the next panel, without a frame, there is a close up of a note. Above the note is a small black frame with Cueballs comment:] Cueball (off-panel): But I got this note from him: [The note:] Dude In like a month im gonna Craigslist all that shit you left in my garage Just FYI -Chad   [Zoom in on Cueball who lifts both hands palms up.] Cueball: It's an outrage! This is no way to run a storage business! Friend (off-panel): Are you paying him to look after your stuff?  [Final frame almost like the first frame, but Cueball has taken his hands down.] Cueball: No. Friend: Then what he runs isn't a storage business. Cueball: Well, I'm this close to not giving him any more stuff. Friend: That'll teach him."
1239: Social Media,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1239:_Social_Media,computers,The social media reaction to this asteroid announcement has been sharply negative. Care to respond?,"This comic parodies how journalists tend to focus on social networking. Specifically in the case of revolutions, social media is given a lot of weight, even in countries with limited internet access. A direct parallel is made to the so-called Twitter Revolutions.  On Twitter you can send text messages with a maximum of 140 characters. This means that there could not be much content in a single post, but often many people follow the people doing these tweets. People who are not on social media tend to react like Cueball and come to the conclusion that twitter makes press coverage more stupid, just because those messages lack much detail. Cueball is also surprised about the stupidity of trying to link social media to the orbit of the asteroid — social media obviously has no impact on the orbit of any space objects, which are entirely driven by physics and gravitational mechanics, and are not influenced by opinions on any media.  The title text continues the joke. The negativity on Twitter concerning an earth bound asteroid has nothing to do with the press conference that announced it but rather with the negativity of wiping out life on earth in general. Again, journalists give undue weight to social media.  It's simply that ""How has twitter affected this"" has become a standard question for journalists, posed in complete disregard of the actual event.","[Cueball heads a press conference.] Cueball: NASA has confirmed that the asteroid is heading directly for us. Cueball: ...Yes, a question? Reporter 1: What role has social media played in this asteroid's orbit? Cueball: *sigh* Reporter 2: Has twitter changed the way we respond to asteroid threats? Cueball: Well, it's made the press conference questions stupider. Reporter 3: Fascinating! Reporter 4: What about Facebook?"
1320: Walmart,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1320:_Walmart,computers,"What I really want is to hang out where I hung out with my friends in college, but have all my older relatives there too.","This comic satirizes the way in which large social networks, such as Facebook and Google+, attempt to aggregate all aspects of the user's online social presence. Earlier social networks had more granular focuses; e.g. MySpace originated with a music focus, and even earlier various bulletin board systems were centered around specific topics. By contrast, many social media companies attempt to encapsulate the variety of aspects of their users' online lives, thereby aggregating their personal, professional, and private lives in a way that was previously unlikely to occur.  The first comparison to Walmart, a large multi-national ""big box"" retailer that sells everything from gardening supplies to televisions to groceries, is apt because Walmart, too, is attempting to aggregate various aspects of your life into a single location - but rather than aggregating your social media presence, it's attempting to aggregate your shopping habits.  The punch line of the joke is that social interactions at Walmart are awkward, contrived, and frequently undesired — just as they can grow to become in a social network that is insufficiently focused or too bloated. People communicate differently with different groups of people, and if they are attempting to connect with friends, they are unlikely to want their grandparents present. Similarly, if a person is attempting to buy groceries, he may not be interested in extended small talk with acquaintances with whom he may not share much in common (perhaps the fact that they both shop at Walmart is the biggest similarity they share).  The title text elaborates on this idea by sarcastically implying that he wants all his older relatives to hang out where he hung out in college, likely causing extreme awkwardness.","When a network tries to become everyone's one-stop hub, the Walmart of social interaction... [Cueball and Hairy standing in a supermarket, Cueball holding groceries under his arm, Hairy with a cart.] Cueball: Oh, uh, hi! Funny running into you here. Hairy: Oh, hey! Yeah! How've you been? ...it inevitably becomes the Walmart of social interaction."
1362: Morse Code,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1362:_Morse_Code,computers,"Oh, because Facebook has worked out SO WELL for everyone.","Cueball recounts the last message sent in morse code by the French maritime radio station Le Conquet radio upon retiring its 500 kHz channel.  The poetic, and potentially angsty-sounding nature of the message reminds him of the on-line journal website LiveJournal, which was popular until the late 2000s (it was launched in 1999), and stereotypically used by angst-ridden teenagers to post song lyrics, poems, or cryptic messages to express their emotions and possibly fish for attention. Since Cueball never uses his LiveJournal account any more, he wonders if he can find the password again. He might be considering posting the final Morse Code message as his own last and final message on his LiveJournal.  The popularity of the site died down considerably with the arrival of social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook, Google Plus and the advent of microblogging platforms like Twitter and Tumblr. LiveJournal has also lost a lot of users since a Russian company bought them out; Russian dissidents used LiveJournal to present their opinions, and the Russian government used to retaliate by creating ""denial of service"" attacks which make LiveJournal unusable for all its users, sometimes for days. Nowadays (May 2014) LiveJournal is still quite popular among Russian-speaking people, including dissenters, but its administration was forced to show HTTP 451 error in some cases (e. g., when a user with a Russian IP is trying to read Alexei Navalny blog) with new laws. Thus when Megan is upset with his desire to let LiveJournal die out like the Morse Code, Cueball describes it as ""a nice place to go for some peace and quiet"".  The title text is Megan's (or Randall's) sarcastic remark indicating that Facebook is no less filled with angst-ridden thoughts than LiveJournal was, nor is it free from problems or controversies around other issues such as security or privacy.  Randall is no stranger to LiveJournal. xkcd started on LiveJournal [1] before xkcd.com was created and is even still alive today [2].  The Morse code for the final message ""this is our final cry on 500 khz before eternal silence"" is:  A period is a very short tone while the hyphen represents a slightly longer one. Between each character there is a small pause. This message was typically sent within less than half a minute.","[Cueball and Megan are lying in a grassy, lonely plain.]  Cueball: When the French navy retired morse code in 1997, they broadcast a final message: ""Calling all. This is our last cry before our eternal silence.""  Cueball: I wonder if I can find my Livejournal login. Megan: Hey, I like Livejournal. Cueball: It's a nice place to go for some peace and quiet, I suppose."
1390: Research Ethics,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1390:_Research_Ethics,computers,"I mean, it's not like we could just demand to see the code that's governing our lives. What right do we have to poke around in Facebook's private affairs like that?","This comic references the recent revelation that Facebook engaged in a ""psychological experiment"" by selectively showing users more ""positive"" or ""negative"" posts on their news feed and recording the users' comments to see if the change affected the positivity or negativity of their posts. Further experiments have since been revealed such as one that tested security measures by locking users out of their accounts.  Here, Megan is commenting on the fact that, while the media is calling this control over what content the user sees ""unethical,"" Facebook, and other companies like Google, must, one way or another, control what content the user sees, whether to present users with a limited selection of all postings, or to tailor ads to particular users; even if the regular algorithms are not set up for psychological experiments, they are still ""manipulating"" what posts users see or don't see. As Megan points out, no one really knows what the ""normal"" constraints are of the algorithm which chooses which posts are shown on news feeds. This comic is parodying the strong reaction to what is basically already a common practice.  Accumulation, control and analysis of user-generated information can be a part of the terms of service/end-user license agreement of a Website or software. In such a scenario, the user has effectively signed his/her consent to being part of such research. Unfortunately, most users don't read the terms before clicking the ""I agree"" option, so it can come as a shock when the service uses the data in a way the user hadn't anticipated.  The title text ironically/sarcastically accepts that Facebook has access to all of its users thoughts through posts and photos, and they can read them for research or other purposes, but contrasts this with a suggestion which likely mirrors how Facebook would respond to such a request that Facebook's code is private and can not be revealed to us. The title text basically appears to be musing that this is backwards, and our personal data should be considered MORE private than Facebook's programming code, which may be proprietary, but is not personal private data.  It is as if your neighbor was spying on you while you left all your shades open, but you felt it to be inappropriate to find out what he knew about you because that's his business. Asking for the source code might similarly be equivalent to asking for the specifications of the binoculars your neighbor used for spying.","[Megan is facing Cueball and Ponytail.] Megan: Facebook shouldn't choose what stuff they show us to conduct unethical psychological research. Megan: They should only make those decisions based on, uh... Megan: However they were doing it before. Megan: Which was probably ethical, right?"
1482: NowPlaying,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1482:_NowPlaying,computers,"If you click on the post, it takes you to search results for the note on various online music stores.","There are a variety of applications that post a user's music-listening habits on their preferred social network. In this comic, Randall takes that notion to its extreme, envisioning a program that does this note-by-note, rather than just song-by-song. As songs play several dozen notes a minute (and some songs, many more), this would lead to the flooding of friends' notification streams. In the example, the software is sharing the notes that Brian is listening to; and his friends Mike and Caitlin are getting annoyed with the number of posts they are receiving.  There are typically many hundreds of notes in any song.  Any song with more than a single line of music contains multiple different notes whose names according to the English convention are communicated here. All but the slowest songs will require reporting dozens to hundreds of notes every minute (a single glissando may cover a dozen or more notes in less than a second), meaning that anyone who can see your stream of posts will be literally inundated by posts from the service. Even if you could keep up with the speed of the posted notes that someone is listening to, the similarity in phrases in many songs (especially pop songs, e.g. Pachelbel's Rant) means that many different songs may include the same sequence of notes, though possibly in different octaves or at different speeds.  The comic's title alludes to the fact that you can ""play a song"" but can also ""play a note."" It may also allude to the visual similarities between the hash/pound/number sign (#) and the sharp sign (♯). C sharp, above Mike's comment, is the only note not given by a single letter (after the correction - see Trivia).  The title text continues the joke of this new musical service: If you click on the post, it takes you to search results for the note on various online music store. Since many songs in similar keys contain at least some of the notes posted, you would be given a list of a large part of the music you can buy in any on-line music stores. Of course this is at least as useless as being told which note someone is listening to.  They appear to be the beginning of I'll Be There For You by The Rembrandts, the title music of the TV series ""Friends"".  This could be an internal reference to the idea that it ""notifies"" (converts into musical notes) your ""friends"" of the notes (a play on words). Alternatively it could simply be an instance of effective nerd sniping.","[A social network news feed with user images for each of the three different contributors.

1642: Gravitational Waves,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1642:_Gravitational_Waves,computers,"That last LinkedIn request set a new record for the most energetic physical event ever observed. Maybe we should respond. ""Nah.""","Megan, Cueball, and Ponytail are observing the results from a gravitational wave detector (see details below). This comic came out on the day that the first direct observation of gravitational waves was publicly announced on 2016-02-11. The actual event was recorded five months before on 2015-09-14, but it was not reported publicly before they were sure it was a real signal. It seems that Randall knew in advance about this announcement because this comic was published on a Thursday, not following the normal publish schedule, to coincide with the announcement, and there were no other comics released Friday that week. (The altered schedule could be viewed as a meta-reference to the warping of spacetime.) That scientists knew there might be an announcement on the way, and more details for the interested can be seen in these two videos from Space Time: Have Gravitational Waves Been Discovered?!? and LIGO's First Detection of Gravitational Waves! (See also their follow up The Future of Gravitational Waves).  This is the second time within a month that a new astronomical announcement (of something discovered months before the actual announcement) has resulted in a related comic. The first being 1633: Possible Undiscovered Planets.   From the patterns in the gravitational waves detected by this instrument, it might be possible to guess the nature of the event (e.g. two bodies with dissimilar masses circling a fixed point, two bodies with equal mass circling each other, collision of two massive bodies, etc.). It might also be possible to triangulate the location of the event. Based on these two facts (the location and nature of the event) we might be able to determine which astronomical bodies caused this event (and the status of those bodies afterwards). Thus, it provides an additional medium to observe the universe in addition to telescopes observing all kinds of electromagnetic radiation. This new medium might enable us to observe properties that we couldn't observe with the rest of our observation instruments.  However, the scientists in this comic appear to be receiving more than the expected signals from black hole collisions, they also receive gravitational spam messages, such as invitations from Linkedin, a mortgage offer, and an announcement of a social meet-up, rather than observing astronomical events (see table below).  There is also a joke on the social meet-up's use of the word local group because the 'Local Group' is also the technical name for the group of galaxies containing the Milky Way.  It is not clear if these so-called ""events"" are causing gravitational waves to be generated or if something, perhaps an alien civilization, is encoding spam messages in gravitational waves. It is plausible that aliens are using gravity waves to encode their messages, as we do something similar with electromagnetic waves to encode and send our messages. However, it would take an extremely advanced civilization to achieve gravity wave encoding. It requires the controlling of orbits and oscillations of super-massive bodies like the Sun, or more likely bodies ten times more massive than it. For example, the first event detected, both in this comic and in real life, was a merger of two black holes of roughly 30 solar masses each.  The title text makes the speculation, that something is sending spam encoded in gravity waves, seem more plausible, as it follows up with a joke that the message senders have gone to such a length that they caused the most energetic event recorded ever (perhaps on the scale of a few supernovae or black hole collisions). One of the scientists is so impressed with this effort that he suggests that they actually post a reply, but one of the other person declines with a ""Nah""! (As you should always do with spam, else you will just encourage the sender by making it clear that there actually is a receiver on this address.) Randall may have been referring to the fact that the detected event had a power output equal to 50 times that of the entire visible universe.  In 1365: Inflation gravitational waves are also mentioned.  A gravitational wave detector is a device used to measure gravitational waves, small distortions of spacetime that were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916. Gravitational waves are ripples in the spacetime fabric itself.  In layman terms, a gravitational wave is like moving a stone through water while partly submerged. It will cause waves on the surface of the water as it moves through it. These waves will spread away from the center of disturbance and as they move, they will cause the water molecules to oscillate around their mean positions. Similar waves are created in the space-time fabric when two celestial bodies interact with each other. If you concentrate on an area of the fabric far away from the point of disturbance, it can be observed that if the wave causes compression in one direction, it'll cause expansion of the fabric in the other. See this page for nice animations.  Note that anything with a mass will cause a gravitational wave. Just as waves created by small stones are tiny in comparison to waves created by huge rocks in water, the waves from humans moving around will be tiny compared to the waves created by celestial bodies. Also, the bigger the body, the stronger the wave and the farther away it can be detected. That is why we can only detect gravity waves from heavy bodies like black holes or neutron stars but not from us moving around.  Now, let's consider spacetime fabric as a thin rubber sheet. If you mark any two points on this sheet and stretch or compress it along the axis joining those two points, the relative positions of these points with respect to their neighboring points do not change, but the distance between them changes.  LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is a large-scale physics experiment designed to detect this compression/expansion, and it was LIGO who discovered the signal that caused this comic. (For a very detailed description of what the team at LIGO did and the history behind see this 90 minutes feature Gravitational Waves: A New Era of Astronomy Begins from the 2016 World Science Festival).  Two facts need to be remembered to easily understand the experiment. First, the speed of light (c) is constant and the speed of an object is the distance moved divided by the time taken to travel that far. Second, gravitational waves cause opposite effects (compression and expansion) in directions perpendicular to each other. At LIGO, an experiment is set up where two perpendicular long tunnels are constructed with apparatus to emit and detect laser beams. The beam from a laser is split into these two tunnels. After going through the tunnel and back again a few times the beams are brought back together. The lengths of the tunnels are set up in such a way that, in the absence of gravity waves, destructive interference between the two combined beams causes them to cancel one another out, resulting in the detector observing zero light intensity. When the gravitational wave passes through earth, one of the tunnel is expected to expand while the other is expected to compress. Due to the difference in lengths, the destructive interference is incomplete and the detectors will be able to detect the presence of light. This observation can be concluded as ""detection of the gravitational wave passing through"".","[Cueball, with arms up, is standing behind Megan who has her hands at her mouth, and who in turn is standing behind Ponytail, who is sitting in front of a large computer console with a screen, a keyboard, and several items on the side (presumably lights and labels).

1645: Toasts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1645:_Toasts,computers,Platonic solids for my real friends and real solids for my platonic friends!,"A toast is a ritual in which a drink is taken as an expression of honor or goodwill. The term may be applied to the person or thing so honored, the drink taken, or the verbal expression accompanying the drink. Thus, a person could be ""the toast of the evening,"" for whom someone ""proposes a toast"" to congratulate and for whom a third person ""toasts"" in agreement.  The comic is based on the quote Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends which, though often attributed to the painter Francis Bacon or to Tom Waits, is a toast dating back to at least the nineteenth century. It is also the entire title of a song, the ninth track on From  Under the Cork Tree, a 2005 album by Fall Out Boy.  The comic plays on a permutation structure between two words (a type of chiasmus), yielding puns with various effects.  In this comic eight persons drink a toast for their ""real friends"" and then for some other type of ""friends"". For the real friend they wish them to have one specific thing. This something is a word (X-Y) that can be split up in two meanings (X and Y), where one of them are then put in front the word friend, to explain what type of friends they are now toasting (often a bad/false type of friend) and then these friends get a wish for having what the word that are left of the original word means: ""X-Y for my real friends and real Y for my X friends""  The first example is a typical toast, in Champagne, where this word can be split in the two phonetically similar words Sham and Pain, and the sham friends then get pain. Below all examples (including the ninth from the title text) are listed with explanation for all words. In some cases the word may actually refer to a drink (like the first with champagne), so that the first word is not something wished for the real friends, but the drink that is in the glass (these have been mentioned below). But for other toasts there is no such drink in existence, and the first word is the thing the toaster wishes for the real friends.","[There are two rows of 4 panels each.

1656: It Begins,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1656:_It_Begins,computers,You can also try 'Yikes.',"This comic encourages the reader to post random news stories on the Internet, under the line ""It begins."" This creates a sense of impending doom, as well as making people wonder what, exactly, is being referred to. This could also encourage people to theorize about what, exactly, is beginning. It could also just confuse the intended audience, as they try to comprehend what the author is saying.  This could in the worst case speedily lead to several people making repost of such a non-news story that would not have gotten any attention otherwise. This may lead to speculation, and other curious theories, going out the tangent it could create fear or mass hysteria.  Some stories that might benefit especially from this are those relating to machine autonomy, animal attacks, disease, and so forth. This would call to mind various popular culture and/or scientific hypothetical scenarios.  Perhaps the comic's choice of article refers to Alfred Hitchcock's thriller The Birds, in which birds (especially seagulls) begin attacking humans for no apparent reason, or the broader idea of an animal revolution, or just that even animals get sick of us always looking at our smart phones.  The title text instructs readers to try the line ""Yikes"" instead. The idea is the same but would give a completely different response.  Other comics which advocate using catch-all phrases as standard responses for any comment:","[A post in Megan's news feed on some social network platform is shown.

1689: My Friend Catherine,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1689:_My_Friend_Catherine,computers,I can't get any work done because my friend Catherine is sitting on my keyboard.,"This is another comic using substitutions to create the joke by replacing words or phrases, in this case ""My cat"", with a different word or phrase, in this case ""My friend Catherine"" (hence the title). The choice of the name is probably because ""Cat"" is a common nickname for ""Catherine"".  By doing so in a list of people discussing things their cat did, it makes it seem like they are discussing things their female human friend did.  What is cute (sitting on keyboards), impressive (doing backflips to eat bugs), or at least normal behavior for a cat (vomiting hairballs) would often be weird, disgusting or disturbing if an adult human were to do it, which is what makes the substitution humorous.  The comic depicts a feed on a page for people discussing their cat, similar to Twitter or Facebook, which would be the only kind of place where the substitution is really funny. Apart from known characters like two looking like Cueball, Megan and Ponytail, there is also a person with black hair, not looking particularly like any standard characters, and then a person with a knit cap, which could be the same knit cap wearing user that was also used in 1506: xkcloud (see the  pictures of the users).","[Captions above the frame:] New favorite substitution: My Cat→My Friend Catherine  [A news feed with comments by six different people discussing their cat, but after the above substitution.

1711: Snapchat,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1711:_Snapchat,computers,"For obvious reasons, the prize is awarded at a different time of year from the others, while it's still fresh in the committee's memory.","Snapchat is a photo-sending app that allows the receiving user to only view the photo (known as a ""snap"") within 24 hours of its posting, and for only 10 seconds before it is deleted. The Pulitzer Prize is famously awarded for exceptional journalism and photojournalism (there are many categories; see here).  Cueball reads that the Snapchat Pulitzer Prize has just been awarded but then, when Megan states that she heard the picture was really good, Cueball becomes disappointed because he realises he has already missed out on the chance to see the prize winning entry due to the temporary nature of Snapchat. Note that Megan also missed the opportunity to see the snap.  A given snap can be sent to a semi-public ""Story"" and the user decides how long any user can see the snap in a range from 1-10 s. In principle, any specific snap is only accessible for 24 hours even if it is a story. A committee of users could have more than 10 seconds to access the snap, by viewing in sequence. Given the time it might take for a committee to decide which snap wins the prize, it is realistic that Cueball learns about the winner after the 24 hours is up; Thus even a user following the outcome might not be able to see the winning entry after that time. In practice it is possible to circumvent the Snapchat rule and take a screen shot or in other ways save the content of the snap. In the case of a Pulitzer Prize winning photo, someone would probably have saved it, if it was in real life. On the other hand, the only way for the photo to be recognised as a snap, eligible to win the prize, would be if no one could see it for more than 10 seconds. So one of the possible rules might be that any picture which was saved would not be able to win the prize.  The title text extends this ephemeral nature of Snapchat's content to the prize awarded for it: The other Pulitzer prizes are announced annually in April and awarded in May (except for 2016, the centennial year, when an awards dinner will be held in October). The Snapchat Pulitzer Prize alone must be awarded as quickly as possible after the winner has been decided, before the prize committee forgets what the winning picture looked like. This of course underlines how silly this idea is, because only images seen during the assembly of the prize committee can be seen and remembered, and it is not possible to arrange this based on any knowledge of when a Pulitzer Prize ""worthy"" snap will be released.  Randall could be making fun of Snapchat (see the title), and the idea that you cannot save the images for later; As mentioned regarding screenshots, it is actually very easy to save pictures from Snapchat - to many a user's regret after having sent something very personal, such as naked pictures of themselves. The comic could also be seen as mocking the Pulitzer Prize for having too broad a spectrum of categories. Alongside the (photo)journalistic and prose awards, the Pulitzers also honor a variety of artistic pursuits, including Poetry, Drama and Music.  The new medium of Snapchat is certainly a hybrid form of art and information/opinion dispersal, both at its best and at its worst, but it is too ephemeral for awarding prizes to be logistically possible even if it were taken seriously enough for someone to want to award them.  The very next comic, 1712: Politifact, features an organization which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2009.","[Cueball and Megan standing together. He holds a smartphone in his left hand and looks at it.] Cueball: Oh, the Pulitzer Prize for Snapchat was just awarded. Megan: Yeah. Megan: I hear the photo was really good. Cueball: Aw, maaaan..."
1761: Blame,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1761:_Blame,computers,I bet if I yell at my scared friends I will feel better.,"Cueball states that he feels sad and links it with his observation that bad things are happening. Sadness is a normal human reaction to perceived bad events[1]. (Other emotions that might be felt at such times include anger and guilt.)  He then reasons that it must be someone's fault. If the ""bad things"" in question are not natural calamities or accidents, it is usually logical to surmise that someone is responsible for them taking place.  After some thinking, he has an idea. Ideas are usually the result of thinking (unless they are a result of computers[citation needed]), although it might not always be conscious thinking like Cueball is doing.  He then blames his ""friends on Facebook"", a social media website and app, for connecting with and talking to friends and family. While there could be possible reasons for bad events (for example if the bad event was nobody wishing him a happy birthday or someone posting compromising pictures,) his friends would not be a likely source for bad events extending beyond a personal or local scope. Most people have a few hundred (or thousand) ""friends"" on Facebook, most of whom do not have enough influence to cause bad events on a national or global level.[citation needed]  This is a reference to people ranting on social media sites (like Facebook) about various things which are blamed on certain people (or sometimes everyone), but the person doing the ranting never thinks that the problem might be with themselves.  It could possibly also be a reference to how an individual's Facebook news feed has probably been inundated by political posts due to the results of the recent 2016 United States presidential election where Donald Trump won, less than two weeks before the release of this comic. Just before the election Randall had shown his supported for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the comic 1756: I'm With Her. That this is indeed the reason is further supported by several other sad comics that followed later. These also seemed related to the election of Donald Trump. But this comic was the first. The second 1773: Negativity can actually be seen as a direct follow up to this comic. Because in that one Cueball finally goes outside his house to avoid all the negativity on-line (probably worsened when he blamed his friends for the bad things happening!).  One read on this is that, many people, including some news sources, have pointed out that social media forms an ""echo chamber"", and some sources have claimed that this is responsible both for political polarization (see this video) and even for the recent victory of Donald Trump in spite of Randall's endorsement of Hillary. Therefore, blaming social media for the election can be read as blaming his friends echoing his ideas back to him as causing (partially) Clinton's loss; thus they are (partially) at fault for his presumed sadness over her loss in the election.  A second read on this would be that constant reminders of Clinton's loss only serve to make Randall sadder: again the proximal cause being his friends' posts.  A third read would be that friends with whom Cueball/Randall disagrees are posting things that he finds unpleasant to read, either ideas that he finds offensive or inconvenient, or posts ""rubbing in"" the victory of the candidate Randall opposed.    The fourth meta-read is that Cueball (as very much distinct from Randall) is not especially smart, and Cueball's mistake here is something that Randall has seen other people make, and Randall is bitter that many people are making said mistake -- not only will venting on Facebook be counterproductive generally, in particular blaming your Facebook friends for the loss of your favored candidate will only make your interpersonal relationships more difficult, such venting will do nothing to correct the root cause of the sadness, partly because a small group of people is relatively powerless, and partly because the very nature of self-selecting Facebook friend-groupings forms a bubble of insular ideological uniformity.  Convincing yourself that your ideological allies are to blame, and then alienating your ideological allies by unfairly blaming them, is dumb; that is the point of the comic, that this ""bright idea"" that Cueball comes up with in panel three, is actually so dumb of an idea as to be humorous.    In real life, where Randall supported Hillary and is sad she lost, one might infer that Randall has seen real-life ideological allies blaming each other:  you should have worked harder for the campaign, you should have donated more, you never should have been mean to that Bernie supporter, you should have listened to me when I said we needed to get out the vote in Michigan, and so on and so on.  Finding a perceived problem, and then blaming your ideological allies as being the cause of that problem, makes it LESS likely that the actual problem will be corrected in future elections, thereby perpetuating the sadness.  Not only is Randall sad that his candidate lost the election, he is sad that Facebook 'friends' are accusing each other of being to blame, and he is expecting to remain sad in future election-cycles thanks to the disunity and infighting that were the byproduct of THIS election-cycle.  See also:  'vicious circle'.   Thus, the comic is actually intended to be entertaining, but also intended to have a moral lesson, like Aesop's fables:  if you lose an election because turnout for your candidate was lower across the board than in was in 2012 and 2008, picking fights with your ideological allies will not help you in 2020, because that will only further disunify the factions within your coalition.  The only way to increase turnout for one's preferred candidate, is to expand the coalition by bringing new voters -- and in some cases re-enticing former voters -- to join with you.  Difficult to do when you spend all your time blaming each other.  Somewhat ironically, this plain message is something that Randall cannot put forth... because telling your ideological allies that they need to stop blaming each other for the problems of the 2016 election-cycle, or they are gonna screw up the 2020 election-cycle, is in itself a way of blaming your allies!  Thus, the comic makes fun of people who blame their ideological allies for not being very bright, but also shows that Randall himself may not have been able to figure out what to do either... which is a cause for sadness, indeed, and one that cannot easily be corrected.  Even though Randall understands the problem, and can make humorous comics which illuminate the trouble, and poke fun at the counterproductive nature of blaming one's local allies for national or global setbacks, that does not mean he can keep people from falling into those counterproductive habits (himself included to some degree).   The title text refers to people venting. The (humorous) assumption here is that one will feel better after doing so. While some amount of venting might help to relieve stress caused by bad events, alienating people you know by blaming them for bad events usually causes more stress in the long run.  (See above explanation about how blaming ideological allies can become a vicious circle.) The fact that he recognizes his friends are scared, like him, but still thinks yelling at them is a good idea shows he's more interested in making himself feel better rather than caring about the well being on his friends.  Additionally, ""yelling"" on social media would likely only increase the influx of:   All of these would make him feel worse, potentially in relatively short order.","Cueball (thinking): I feel sad. Bad things are happening.  Cueball (thinking): They must be someone's fault. But whose?  [Cueball makes several thinking poses before a light bulb appears, indicating he has an idea]  Cueball (thinking): My friends on Facebook."
1802: Phone,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1802:_Phone,computers,"[*disables social networking accounts*] [*social isolation increases*] Wait, why does this ALSO feel bad?","When someone asks you if you want to go for a walk they often expect to have a conversation, while enjoying both the exercise, the fresh air and the company. Thus any disturbance not related to the walk is not welcome. Going for a walk is often seen as a way to relax from all the daily stress, as it takes the walkers away from work and chores.   Cueball agrees to go for a walk, but not to all the associated expectations. His first instinct is to bring along his smartphone, though rather than call it such, he opts for a lengthy description detailing all the functions he intends to use. He describes the phone as a device that gives him a continuous (24/7) stream of information, much of which is often out of context. The stream contains people's opinions, context-free but scary news, and other random stimuli. Conspicuously, long-distance communication (ostensibly the primary function of a smartphone) is not listed. This may be a sign that Cueball is addicted to his phone.  The stream of opinions mentioned could be from news or bloggers but it could also just be from his friends on social media platforms. News stories that are shared on social media are often scary, which becomes even worse because news outlets are likely to use a title that exaggerates the topic to create a fear reaction. The random emotional stimuli could be from many things such as text messages/emails and pictures of kittens and babies on social network, and shared internet memes or viral videos. All things that could cause a quick shift in emotions.   As if all this was not enough, Cueball even says he will also take his spare battery, so he won't risk that his constant feed could be interrupted, because he will not be able to recharge his phone during the walk. All in all, his choice and constant need for staying updated and being online violates all the usual expectations, that his friend could have expected from asking him out for a walk. Randall's fear of running out of power on his smartphone was earlier mentioned in 1373: Screenshot, where a low battery charge stresses him too much to realize it is someone else screenshot, rather than his own phone that has a low charge.  The title text shows it would be possible to take an action to avoid this feed. In the first bracket a person (could be Cueball or Randall) disables all his social networking accounts. Most of his news feed will thus disappear. But this leads to the next bracket which states that such a choice would lead to increased social isolation, since he will no longer be in contact with any of his online friends. In fact, today many people also get into contact with their ""real"" local friends through social media, so one might thus miss out on events like parties or get-togethers.  In addition, his friends, not sharing his dislike for social media, may not understand his decision. All of this leads to the final sentence Wait, why does this ALSO feel bad?","[Someone off-panel asks Cueball a question which he answers while walking to a small table with some items laying on it.] Off-panel voice: Wanna go for a walk? Cueball: Sure, just need to grab my device that feeds me a 24/7 stream of opinions, context-free scary world news, and random emotional stimuli. Cueball: Plus a spare battery so the feed won't be interrupted."
1810: Chat Systems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1810:_Chat_Systems,computers,I'm one of the few Instagram users who connects solely through the Unix 'talk' gateway.,"The comic consists of an Euler diagram showing a wide variety of chat systems and their intersections. (Euler diagrams should not be confused with Venn diagrams, see more on this here). The comic demonstrates the complexity that can be involved in modern communications: simply remembering how to get in touch with someone can be a challenge.  Below is a table with explanation for all 24 mentioned chat systems and below that a list of each system's intersections with the other systems. Several of the systems are already considered old, like The ""chat"" tab in an old Google Doc, but some people keep using them, which is part of the joke. There only seems to be one ""chat"" system which could in no way be said to be an on-line chat system, and that is the Wall (bathroom) at the bottom, which refers to how people writes notes on public bathroom walls, making it an extra joke and possibly a reference to 229: Graffiti.  In the title text, Randall explains how he is one of the only few Instagram users to use the UNIX 'talk' gateway (an old peer-to-peer chat system whereby users logged into the same UNIX system could privately communicate with each other in a full-screen interface.) But he doesn't tell how he had enhanced this old fashioned software.  Note that this is similar to the earlier 949:_File_Transfer.  The 24 chat systems with the number of stick figures inside are listed. Notice there are only 23 real systems, as one of the systems is a bathroom wall.","[An Euler diagram with many circle like drawings for various chat systems is shown. Some circles overlapping others in complicated ways, others are single circles with no connections, but most are embedded into others.

1911: Defensive Profile,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1911:_Defensive_Profile,computers,"NO DRAMA ZONE -> If I've made you sad, you'd better not tell me, because I am TERRIFIED of that situation and have NO IDEA how to handle it.","This comic demonstrates a theoretical feature which provides more honest interpretations of social media profiles. We see a profile for a person who says they have ""no filters"" and has no qualms about offending or upsetting anybody with their seemingly radical views. But the ""translation"" of the description reveals that it is a vastly insecure person who seems to have the problem of saying the wrong thing every time and so their profile description is a way for them to justify their comments.   The title text continues, with the aggressive ""NO DRAMA ZONE"" turning out to mean that the user is merely trying to keep any offended or genuinely upset comments away from their page because they simply have no idea how to emotionally handle hurting someone's feelings.   Randall previously demonstrated another theoretical feature to address passive-aggressive behavior in 1085: ContextBot.  The comic's feature may be based on the context menu option of the Google Chrome web browser to have a foreign language webpage translated to the user's selected native language. However, in Google Chrome, the user may only translate the entire page, while in this comic the user may also select some text and have only the selected part translated. Also, Google Chrome uses Google Translate for translation by default, which cannot read minds like in the comic.[citation needed] However, if one uses the official Google Translate extension for Google Chrome, one may actually translate only the selected text. It is possible then that it is instead the extension which inspired the comic's feature.  This comic not only illustrates such a feature, but implies that the ""translated"" thoughts are what's actually going on behind posts of these types on social media, as if Randall can actually read those people's minds somehow. If this implication is the intent of the comic, then Randall thinks that people who have ""no filter"" are actually insecure and that people who want ""NO DRAMA"" are actually afraid of upset comments. Alternatively, Randall hates people who post such things in their profiles, and therefore wants to belittle them in this comic as actually being insecure, rather than being as confident as their aggressive behavior implies. This explanation is corroborated by notable news near the comic's publishing time (see below).  The style of the profile showcased in the comic resembles the profiles of the popular social media website Twitter, which while the user is logged in, shows the user's own profile on the left side of the page in a similar style to the comic, with their picture on the left side of their name, their Twitter handle under their name (which explains the extra line of text under what is presumably the name) and their ""bio"" right below those. The Twitter ""bio"" is a space usually used for the user to explain who they are. Common details about a person which are included in their ""bio"" are their profession, their personal interests and the products they have for sale. Some people also write about their personality, such as the one in the comic, which is quite outspoken and frank about her opinions.  One notable news item regarding Twitter, near the comic's publishing time, is that a rogue employee of the Twitter company, on the last day of his job, banned the personal Twitter profile of U.S. President Donald Trump (it was undone 11 minutes later). While Donald Trump never wrote something similar to what the comic portrays on his Twitter profile, he is known to post ""politically incorrect"" statements there. Donald Trump does not seem to care about who those statements offend, just like the person in the comic. Randall is known to have supported the opposing candidate before he was elected, having made a comic just to promote her, and particularly sad comics following his election. These events may have inspired the comic.  The title of this comic is ""Defensive Profile"". ""Defensive"" is the opposite of ""offensive"", which is a word that might be used to describe the contents of profiles which display such a warning as in the comic. However, the feature reveals the warnings to actually be defenses against behaviors that deeply bother the profile owner. The profile is thus proved to actually be ""defensive"" instead of ""offensive"", at least regarding the warning text.","[A profile on an unknown social media site is displayed. The profile picture is a close-up image of Megan. The profile reads:]  I speak my mind and don't care who I offend. No filter.  [In the next panel, the text is highlighted, and a context menu has appeared. There is a mouse pointer on the option ""View translation"".] Copy Select all View translation [selected] Print  [In the last panel, the profile text is updated:]  I don't understand why people keep getting mad at me and I'm using this pep talk to convince myself that's okay."
1914: Twitter Verification,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1914:_Twitter_Verification,computers,"When we started distributing special status tokens that signify which people are important enough to join an elite group, we never could have imagined we might be creating some problems down the line.","Some Twitter users (such as Coldplay, or Donald Trump) have a verification checkmark next to their name.  This checkmark is used to indicate that the user is who they say they are, rather than being a fake account made by someone else using their picture and name. This helps fans find the real accounts of their favorite celebrities. However, since the most notable people benefit from this the most, there is some ambiguity in the granting of the verified mark, as it also seems to be interpreted as a status symbol to indicate the notable celebrities. Some even see this as Twitter actively endorsing the user. For this reason, Twitter has removed verified checkmarks from real accounts of celebrities because of political controversies in the past. Examples of this are political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos (before he was banned from the service). One recent controversial decision regarding the verified mark is that Twitter gave a verification checkmark to Jason Kessler, the organizer of a recent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.  This drew attention to Twitter's verification system, so they temporarily suspended it.  The alt-text comments on the lack of foresight on Twitter's part when implementing the verified system: as it by design separates users between an in-group and an out-group, it seems to imply endorsement or, at least, favors some users to the detriment of others. This in turn automatically creates the twin sets of ""people who shouldn't have been verified, but were"" and ""people who deserve to have been verified, but weren't."" As the internet is populated by various large and strongly opinionated groups [citation not needed], neither set will ever be empty and Twitter will always be seen as either endorsing unworthy or snubbing worthy people.  The last line of dialogue is likely a pun on the Twitter Moments feature, which can be used to compile several tweets with a shared theme into a browsable gallery. The character depicted is the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, judging by the beard.","[A bearded figure, depicting the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is standing behind a podium with the blue Twitter bird logo.] Jack: Everyone calm down— Jack: We just need to go figure out how to bestow a global in-or-out status badge on some people, at our discretion, without anyone reading anything into who gets one.  Jack: This should only take a moment."
185: Wikifriends,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/185:_Wikifriends,computers,"It's crazy how much my gut opinion of a movie/song is swayed by what other people say, regardless of how I felt coming out of the theater.","The comic's title refers  Wikis, which are collaboratively edited websites. The first such site was WikiWikiWeb, but Wikipedia (an online encyclopedia) has become the most well-known example, and may have been specifically what Randall had in mind, as other comics do reference Wikipedia.  The influence of social environment is called peer pressure, often with a negative connotation. The term ""Wikifriends"" is coined in the comic as a label for people who adjust their views in order to incorporate into a group. That is to say that, in the same way a Wiki page can be edited by people other than the original author, a ""Wikifriend"" allows their opinions to be ""edited"" by someone else. As an example, the comic shows a discussion about a movie in which one collocutor entirely veers in his opinion when he hears what his friend thinks.  The title text suggests that Randall also observes himself to be frequently influenced by others.",WikiFriends: [Two people are talking to each other.] Cueball: I really liked that movie. Friend: I hated that movie. Cueball: Me too.
214: The Problem with Wikipedia,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/214:_The_Problem_with_Wikipedia,computers,Taft in a wet t-shirt contest' is the key image here.,"This comic illustrates the ""problems"" of information explosion coupled with a dense web of hypertext links. Through most of human history, written media has been both slow and linear. Hypertext allows a new type of information consumption, through small chunks of information linked together in a web of related concepts, and by being digital, each new chunk can be retrieved quickly and effortlessly. Wikipedia applies this principle very strongly, and because it covers so many topics, it is common for a reader to skim an article about a topic they need or want to know about, and end up following a series of links out of curiosity. Since each new page also has several links, the overall navigation pattern resembles a tree that branches out, ""exploding"" in size with each new level of link-clicking, thus resulting in many wasted hours (over three in this case) of reading stuff unrelated to the original goal, and lots of open browser tabs holding a wide variety of articles, which are seemingly unrelated, but have common ""ancestors."" (The problem, for Randall, of wasting time on Wikipedia was later referenced in the title text of 1501: Mysteries, and the more general problem of getting trapped following a never-ending chain of interesting links was covered in 609: Tab Explosion.) The large diversity in end links may also be a reference to the Wikipedia game.  One can also see this effect occur in other MediaWiki-powered wikis such as this very website, where one comic can lead to another of similar relation or category. In the table below, a possible route for each entry has been found.  Finding routes between the start and end points of the two pages above and the six below makes good challenges in the Wikipedia game.  The title text refers to two of the articles that were supposedly reached at the bottom. William Howard Taft was the 27th President of the U.S., in office from 1909 to 1913, who was notorious for being so overweight that he became stuck in the White House bathtub. A wet T-shirt contest is an exhibitionistic competition typically featuring young women contestants at a nightclub, bar, or resort. Clearly the combination of these two would be rather bizarre.  There is an online game that involves trying to get from one Wikipedia page to another in the shortest possible route: http://thewikigame.com/.  Due to the ever changing nature of Wikipedia, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge entry on Wikipedia no longer links to Structural collapse, requiring an intermediate step via Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940), and since Structural collapse now redirects to Structural integrity and failure, most pages on Wikipedia that linked to Structural collapse have been changed to rename this link.","[Heading above the chart:] The Problem with Wikipedia: [Text in a frame below the heading:] Tacoma Narrows Bridge [Lines lead down both left and right to two new frames with the following text:]  Suspension bridge  Structural collapse [Two more lines lead down from the left frame and one from the right frame, and each line ends on a wiggling line.

Wait, damn, original research.","The ""Choices"" series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday). It explores and marvels at human freedom. This is, however, a little sidetrack from the ""Choices"" narrative. Cueball is studying special relativity. The speed of light in a vacuum (299,792,458 m/s) is denoted as c. Megan and the spaceship are shown traveling at 0.2c in opposite directions. This would mean (in Newtonian mechanics) 0.4c relative to each other. But due to relativistic effects, their velocities do not simply add when the spaceship observes Megan; in reality, both would measure only 0.385c ( = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c2) ) from the other's point of view. Also, time dilation influences the way time is observed with reference to the two frames of reference. Megan, however, has other concerns. (This text and part of the image were completely reused in the space part of the interactive 1350: Lorenz (see image here).  In the title text, Megan thinks about writing about this after-worldly place in Wikipedia, but then realizes that the content would be removed, due to the Wikipedia policy on original research. Even though her claims would be true, she would need reliable written sources to support them.

The sign text is based on the Wikipedia template that can be placed next to statements that need citations, usually because of questionable validity. Cueball is using this template to challenge the politician's speech.  The title text below the comic references semi-protection, a protection measure typical of Wikipedia, which basically protects some articles from being edited anonymously. Constitutional amendments cannot usually be proposed anonymously, meaning that in effect, all articles of constitution are semi-protected.","[There is a politician speaking at a podium, which sports an American flag.] [In front of the speaker there is a crowd of people listening.

This comic may also be a reference to how people can get addicted to reading Wikipedia pages, because there are many interesting links on each page that people haven't read yet, and there are links on that page that they click on, etc. This may be the reason that Cueball is reading Wikipedia instead of sleeping with Megan, because he got stuck in the link loop.  The title text refers to the fact that many rely on Wikipedia instead of remembering/learning stuff.

444: Macgyver Gets Lazy,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/444:_Macgyver_Gets_Lazy,computers,"At the time of this writing, Wikipedia has a wonderful article titled 'List of problems solved by Macgyver'","MacGyver was a 80s and early 90s TV character, famed for improvising complex devices in a matter of minutes in order to escape dangerous situations. In this comic MacGyver suggests an unusually direct plan—shooting the guard in the head. However, he still manages to describe his plan in a rather 'complex' manner.  It is worth noting that in the show, MacGyver was adamantly against the use of guns and never used one (at least, not for its intended purpose) in the entire run of the old series.  A MacGyver reboot was made in 2016, and was not well received (38% on Metacritic, 4.6/10 in iMDb). It has only one season so far.  The Wikipedia page referenced by the title text redirects to the main MacGyver entry since September 2012. The Wikipedia page can still be found in history, and the content has been moved to MacGyver wikia and expanded.","[Outside of a building with a door marked No Entry and a guard standing outside, Cueball and MacGyver are hiding.] Cueball: Any ideas? MacGyver: I can use the trigger mechanism of this gun to ignite a small explosive charge, propelling a metal slug into the guard's head."
446: In Popular Culture,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/446:_In_Popular_Culture,computers,"Someday, the 'in popular culture' section will have its own article with an 'in popular culture' section. It will reference this title-text referencing it, and the blogosphere will implode.","Wikipedia is a popular online encyclopedia with articles that are created and edited by the general public [citation required] . Wikipedia entries have many sections, with the first few explaining the general concept and details behind the subject.  When this comic was written many Wikipedia articles had a section at the end entitled ""in popular culture"", listing TV shows, movies, songs and so on which made reference to the subject at hand. In many cases, this list was extensive, possibly because the people editing the articles were such fans of the subject or the pop culture in which it is referenced, they couldn't help but go into great detail, listing many esoteric and seemingly irrelevant elements of pop culture which were peripherally related to the subject of the article. As an example, see the old article Apollo in popular culture which as of August 2007 redirects to Apollo.  The joke in this case is that even such a mundane article such as one on wood could have an ""in popular culture"" section and obviously, wooden items are common enough that there are any number of instances of popular culture which could be considered to ""reference it"", even if that's something as basic as a wooden item being used as a prop in a TV show. Such information would be of little or no use to anybody and only somebody obsessed with wood, a particular element of pop culture in which wood makes an appearance or the concept of placing pop culture references in encyclopedia articles would bother to create or maintain such a section.  Also, wood being such a popular material, the list of references could be virtually endless. This is a reference to the fact that the ""in popular culture"" sections of many Wikipedia articles contained dozens of items, even for articles on fairly arcane subjects. Note that the end of this particular ""in popular culture"" section is not visible so we don't know how long it is.  The title text states that in the future there will even have to be a wiki page with the subject ""In popular culture"". This article will also need an ""in popular culture"" section and it will be obvious to make a reference directly to this title text, as xkcd is part of popular culture and because this title text predicted the creation of and need for such a page. However this would then create a circular reference. This could be considered a form of infinite loop which is one way to cause a computer to crash (lock up). The joke is that the blogosphere could follow this endless train of circular links and itself crash, causing an ""implosion"".  This comic was mentioned in Wikipedia:""In popular culture"" content. However, on April 23, 2014, the reference was edited out. It has since been added under the external links section of Wikipedia:xkcd in popular culture.  The reference was added back in May 2015.","[A fictional screen capture of the Wikipedia article for ""wood"" is shown.

545: Neutrality Schmeutrality,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/545:_Neutrality_Schmeutrality,computers,"Hey, everyone, you can totally trust that I didn't do a word count on MY edit!'","Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia with content developed and submitted by volunteers around the world. In fact, its slogan is ""Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit."" Most articles on the site can be altered by anyone with access to Wikipedia.  Wikipedia has set some standards for its operation, which it refers to as the ""Five pillars of Wikipedia"". One of these pillars is titled ""Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view.""  Pro-life and pro-choice refer to two opposing viewpoints in the debate of the moral and legal rights concerning abortion. For many on both sides, it is a very emotional topic.  Black Hat has decided to prove that you can create an article which fundamentally cannot remain neutral. Since his charitable donation is determined by the word count of the article, any submission to Wikipedia must result in supporting either pro-life or pro-choice. And with a reward of one million dollars, it is unlikely that either side would allow an article to remain unedited which supported its opponent.  The title of the comic references an old (read, ""pre-Internet"") meme, possibly of Yiddish origin, known as shm-reduplication. The speaker replaces the initial consonant cluster (have it 0, 1 or even 2+ consonants) with the cluster ""schm"", read /ʃm/, and says the new word after the unadulterated word, as in the title where it is ""N"" that has been replaced. This denotes an active apathy or an intentional disregard of the authority (for it is usually an authority or someone in a similar position) being mocked. In this case, Black Hat is disregarding Wikipedia's neutrality doctrine with his word count dependent donation rule.  The title text is a statement from the Wikipedia author in an attempt to assert the neutrality of the submission, claiming no word count was performed before posting (an unlikely scenario).","[Above the frame:] Trivia: It's possible to create events which Wikipedia cannot cover neutrally [Black Hat is at a press conference in which he is making an announcement in front of a large crowd mainly of Cueballs but also some Megans.] Black Hat: In a week, I will be donating $1,000,000 to a recipient determined by the word count of the Wikipedia article about this event. If it's even, the money goes to pro-choice activists. If it's odd, pro-life."
547: Simple,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/547:_Simple,computers,"Actually, I think if all higher math professors had to write for the Simple English Wikipedia for a year, we'd be in much better shape academically.","There are three Cueballs discussing a particle accelerator. One Cueball asks the others about the ""tertiary Free-electron laser (F.E.L) guidance system"". As this is a fairly technical topic, we would expect a response filled with scientific jargon. The joke is that the other Cueball instead responds in a much simpler manner. He uses simple phrases such as ""smash the right things together"" and ""that would be very bad"".  As the caption below the comic notes, Cueball and/or Randall has spent the previous night reading the Simple English Wikipedia, a simplified version of Wikipedia intended to be easier to understand, and now he finds himself using similarly simple syntax. For example, the article for a particle accelerator describes it as ""a machine that makes really tiny things called particles travel at very high speeds."" This is similar to the simple response given by the responding Cueball. In the actual comic, Cueball was able to effectively communicate the dangers of using a broken F.E.L. using simple syntax similar to the style of the Simple English Wikipedia.  From the title text, Randall believes that if people teaching advanced mathematics followed this style, their subject would be more accessible. The implication is that more people would be drawn to studying mathematics and that (naturally) the world would be a better place because of this!  This concept was later revisited in 722: Computer Problems, 1133: Up Goer Five, (possibly most notably) Thing Explainer, and 1436: Orb Hammer.","[Three Cueball-like guys stand in front of a sketch. The middle Cueball is the protagonist of the comic and will be called Cueball.] Left Cueball-like guy: Do you have any thoughts regarding the particle accelerator's tertiary F.E.L. Guidance System?

631: Anatomy Text,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/631:_Anatomy_Text,computers,"For many of the anatomy pictures on Wikipedia, I think this is actually not far from reality. They only look all formal and professional due to careful cropping.","Megan and Cueball are taking photos of their own anatomy for inclusion in relevant Wikipedia articles. It is revealed that instead of taking these photos at home or in a professional studio, they are shooting at a TGI Friday's restaurant.  TGI Friday's is an American multinational restaurant chain known for its casual family-friendly atmosphere, upbeat service, and fried appetizers. Megan's and Cueball's behaviour is of course highly inappropriate, due to the sanitation issues relating to sitting or laying naked on the tables, as well as public decency issues; nudity is illegal in most public places, and this is compounded by the fact that there are usually children in TGI Friday's. It is likely that the erection plate, is supposed to refer to a fear erection, created as a result of greater blood pumping from adrenaline  The message implicit in the comic (and stated outright in the title text) is that careful cropping can produce useful, apparently professional reference images, even if the source photograph was not taken in a professional manner, or was pornographic in nature.","Plate 15: Female breast [There is a drawing of a breast, with 'breast', 'areola', and 'nipple' labeled.]  Plate 16: External female genitalia [There is a picture of external female genitalia.

682: Force,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/682:_Force,computers,Force-choking the chicken.,"This comic features Darth Vader, the main antagonist from the original Star Wars trilogy.   Autoerotic asphyxiation is a sexual practice in which lack of oxygen is induced to enhance sexual stimulus. The technique is considered extremely dangerous, especially without supervision, as loss of consciousness can result in continued strangling which can quickly be fatal.  In the films, Vader possesses the ability to restrict the airway of an opponent without having to touch them, using only the so-called ""force"". This practise has therefore been called force-choking. The comic assumes that Vader used this technique against himself, with the help of a mirror, in order to become sexually aroused.  Lord Vader has apparently force-choked himself to the point of unconsciousness (or possibly even death) and is being transported from his house on a stretcher by two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).  The title text is a pun on the term ""choking the chicken"", a colloquial expression referring to male masturbation. ""Force-choking the chicken"" might mean a technique of self-gratification by use of the ""force"" without having to apply one's hands.",[Two EMTs are rushing Darth Vader away from a front door on a stretcher.]  [There is a room with a desk in the foreground and a full-length mirror in the corner.

739: Malamanteau,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/739:_Malamanteau,computers,"The article has twenty-three citations, one of which is an obscure manuscript from the 1490s and the other twenty-two are arguments on LanguageLog.","A malapropism is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical utterance.  An example of a malapropism is Yogi Berra's statement: ""Texas has a lot of electrical votes,"" rather than ""electoral votes"". A portmanteau is a word made-up of two or more combined words and their definitions. For example, motel is a portmanteau, from the words motor and hotel. A neologism is simply a newly coined word that is not yet in common use.   Here, Randall shows a hypothetical Wikipedia page of the word ""malamanteau"" which is both a portmanteau of ""malapropism"" and ""portmanteau"" and a malapropism of ""portmanteau"". Finally, ""malamanteau"" is itself a neologism because Randall invented the word when he wrote this comic. The methods used to create this new word are the very words used in the process. This is called a meta or ""self-referential"" joke.  ""Malamanteau"" was originally coined in 2007, when it was proposed by user ludwig_van on Metafilter as a term for language errors like ""flustrated"" (flustered & frustrated) and ""misconscrewed"" (misconstrued & screwed).   The bottom line of the comic (Ever notice how Wikipedia has a few words it really likes?) is a reference to the large number of Wikipedia pages that start by labeling their subject matter as a malapropism, a portmanteau, or a neologism.   In response to this comic, editors at Wikipedia created a malamanteau page. It was deleted multiple times and eventually turned into a redirect to the Wikipedia page for xkcd. Malamanteau and the controversy at Wikipedia got coverage at The Economist and The Boston Globe.  The title text refers to Wikipedia's requirements of citations for a page on there to exist. It also refers to the wide range of places citations can be obtained from, showing a direct opposition due to the use of very different citations (The Language Log arguments are modern and informal, whereas the obscure manuscript is formal and much older). Language Log is a blog that posts content relating to language and linguistics, including things like malapropisms and portmanteaus. While an informal source, it has produced new linguistic terms before, such as eggcorn. Its comments sections frequently contain discussions and arguments about English, whose participants are probably the same people who write Wikipedia articles about linguistic phenomena like malamanteaux. The fact that no modern citation could be found outside of Language Log comments implies that the malamanteau is not a widely recognized or studied concept, but one invented by amateur linguists. Malamanteau did not appear on Language Log until after this strip. Malamanteau has since been referenced on the Language Log website, with a link to the comic in question. Language Log has referenced XKCD many times before, reposting the comics and linking to the XKCD website.  The citation of a document from the 1490s is a reference to the fact that linguists, like those who post on Language Log, often use old documents as evidence, possibly to prove that a construction is a longstanding feature of the language. However, if such an archaic citation is the only evidence of the term's use, then it is unlikely to be a notable feature worthy of a Wikipedia article.  Further, the title text implies that the fictional article isn't exactly the most stable inside the fictional Wikipedia's userbase, or otherwise is being subject to some severe favoritism, since ""malamanteau"" hasn't been used at any time since the feudal ages and its most recent citations are a borderline flame war on another website. Most articles that are only cited by a single website tend to get deleted unless the subject has achieved significant coverage in outside news media.","[The strip is set up as the top of a Wikipedia page.] [The Wikipedia logo.] Wikipedia The free encyclopedia [Side navigation options.] Navigation -Main Page -Contents -Featured Content -Current Events [Wikipedia header options.] Article  Discussion  Edit this page  History [The article itself.] Malamanteau From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A malamanteau is a neologism for a portmanteau created by incorrectly combining a malapropism with a neologism.

843: Misconceptions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/843:_Misconceptions,computers,"Grandpa, what was it like in the Before time? ""It was hell. People went around saying glass was a slow-flowing liquid. You folks these days don't know how good you have it.""","The Wikipedia article List of common misconceptions gives a list of commonly-repeated anecdotes that are widely believed to be true, but actually are not.   The teacher, Miss Lenhart, is announcing that since it is the first Tuesday in February, by law and custom the reading of this article is requirement to stem the repetition of these incorrect anecdotes. (Funnily enough the comic was released the first Wednesday in January, which could just as well have been written in the comic).  She continues to make it clear that this is to make the students in general a little less wrong, and the main outcome will be that the guest of any future parties the students ever attend, will not have to listen to them retell these misconceptions and for that these guest will thank those who have decided on this new law in advance.  In the caption below the comic Randall expresses his wishes that he lived in a parallel universe where this rule had been used for many years. So he would not have to listen to all these stories at every party he goes to. Since Randall likes to correct people if they are wrong (see 386: Duty Calls), not having to discuss with those that believe these misconceptions, would make his parties much better.  The title text refers to a specific one of these false stories about glass:   In reality, older manufacturing processes did not produce glass panes with as uniform thickness as modern processes, and people tended to install the uneven panes with the thicker side at the bottom for stability. Glass simply does not flow at room temperature; it's more viscous than solid lead by a factor of over a billion. The fact that glass is solid at room temperature was again referenced in a foot note, under the pipe with glass, in 1649: Pipelines.  It seems that Miss Lenhart has taken the right course from 803: Airfoil as she there thought another common misconception.","[Miss Lenhart the teacher is standing in front of a board, looking at a laptop computer she is holding in one hand while elocuting.] Miss Lenhart: Okay, middle school students, it's the first Tuesday in February. Miss Lenhart: This means that by law and custom, we must spend the morning reading through the Wikipedia article List of Common Misconceptions, so you can spend the rest of your lives being a little less wrong.

899: Number Line,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/899:_Number_Line,computers,"The Wikipedia page List of Numbers opens with ""This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.""","Once again, Randall seems to be just messing around, this time with a number line.  The title text is a literalism joke, implying that Wikipedia would like its ""List of numbers"" page to include every number from negative infinity to infinity. It could also be a reference to Gödel's incompleteness theorems, which Randall has used as comic fodder before in 468: Fetishes. Gödel's theorems roughly assert that a number theory could never be fully complete. The equivalent for a list of numbers is Cantor's diagonal argument, which is a proof that any list of real numbers can never be complete even if the list is infinitely long. Either way, any ""true"" Wikipedia article named ""List of numbers"" would perforce forever be incomplete, no matter how much it was expanded. Both Gödel's incompleteness theorems and Cantor's diagonal argument feature prominently in Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter, to whom Randall devoted later comic 917: Hofstadter. It may also be referencing his previous statements about Wikipedia being the home of compulsive list-makers, who make the most astonishingly complete lists imaginable.","[Number line ranging from -1 to 10.] [Arrow pointing left, towards negative numbers] Negative ""imitator"" numbers (do not use) [Line right before the number one] 0.99...

906: Advertising Discovery,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/906:_Advertising_Discovery,computers,"When advertisers figure this out, our only weapon will be blue sharpies and ""[disputed]"".","On Wikipedia, a well-referenced text or statement indicates credibility. References for particular facts are linked to by bracketed blue little numbers in superscript.[1][3][4] When faced with a statement followed by these, readers will normally believe it without further ado,[6][10] since they take it on trust that there are directions on the bottom of the page, leading to a reliable source or two, agreeing with what the statement says. The effect becomes strengthened when such information often is confirmed to be correct.  In the comic, advertisers have realized that it has gone so far that people in general will take any nonsense for granted if there is just the right amount of Wikipedia-style reference tags to it. The penis pump e-commerce can suddenly flourish (again?) and the spammers won't even need to bother making up findings to cite.  Turgidax® is something Randall formed from turgid, meaning swollen. One reason that the attaching of -ax creates a typically pill-like name is simply that -ax (and -ex) are common Latin adjectival word endings, and that many drugs have names formed from Latin words. -Ax is also, specifically, the root of the -acious ending in English, as in ""audacious"" or (appropriately) bodacious, meaning ""extra"" or ""especially"". The idea is it makes the genitalius extra or especially turgid. Cardiovascular means relating to the heart and blood vessels.   The title text is about how Wikipedia users have been able to add ""disputed""-tags (nowadays ""disputed – discuss"") after challenged facts, with this template, since the dawn of time.[11][disputed – discuss] So when faced with the new advertising trick IRL, we could counter by scribbling those tags all over with blue Sharpie marker pens, and so automatically revive the critical thinking.","Advertising discovery: [Person sits at computer, reading an ad on the screen.

911: Magic School Bus,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/911:_Magic_School_Bus,computers,"At my OLD school, we used Microsoft Encarta 2005.","The Magic School Bus is a series of educational children's books in the US that was adapted in the mid-nineties into an animated television show. The series centers on a class of children whose teacher Ms. Frizzle makes use of the titular magic school bus to take her students on a variety of magical field trips that allow them to experience various scientific topics first hand, such as the inner anatomy of the human body, the effects of friction, what goes on inside a beehive, and many others.  In this comic, however, Ms. Frizzle initially takes the students onto the bus apparently for one of these field trips to explore the way batteries work, but then for whatever reason, she has the students get off the bus again and simply resorts to looking up the Wikipedia article about batteries. The implied joke is that, with the advent on resources like Wikipedia, it's no longer necessary for Ms. Frizzle to take the students on half-hour long trips in the bus to experience whatever phenomenon they are studying that day (which is what the third panel symbolizes) - Wikipedia effectively answers the question quickly and easily. An alternative answer is that Ms. Frizzle has just gotten lazy, and has resorted to looking up the answers to the students' questions on Wikipedia instead of taking them on field trips. The alternative seems more likely, since the third panel shows them still going on an adventure, however briefly it takes to get to the library/computer lab.  The red and white cubed rocket in the bottom of the third panel can possibly be a reference to The Adventures of Tintin, in which Tintin goes to the moon in a rocket that is similar, if not identical, to the one depicted.  The child who is asking the question looks similar to Wanda, one of the regular students in the class who often asked the questions that set the field trips in motion. Ralphie, the student in the second panel with the backward hat, was another student who often asked these questions. The students in the class were shown to be from many backgrounds (i.e. some of the students were black, another was Asian, etc.), something Randall appears not to have added into this comic, despite it being in color.  The title text is a reference to Phoebe, one of the students in Ms. Frizzle's class, who would regularly make a remark beginning with ""At my old school..."" (Phoebe used to go to a different school, unlike many of the other students in the class) to express wonder at how unusual were the events of Ms. Frizzle's field trips (e.g. ""At my old school, we never rode on bees!""). Phoebe actually said that so much that in an episode where she goes back to her old school, the sign out front labels it as ""Phoebe's old school"".  Microsoft Encarta 2005 was a digital encyclopedia that was often used in school settings for learning with the aid of computers. Arguably, with the advent of Wikipedia, programs like Encarta have become relatively less widely used, which is part of the joke in the title text.","[A girl sits at a desk in a classroom, and the teacher stands before her.

915: Connoisseur,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/915:_Connoisseur,computers,"Our brains have just one scale, and we resize our experiences to fit.","White Hat is fond of good wine, and he can probably distinguish slight differences in different types of wine, perhaps being the type that attends wine tasting parties. He doesn't like the cheap wine that Cueball has served for him (implying a cheap wine cannot be a good one, a statement most wine enthusiasts passionately agree with), looking with disgust at the label of the offending bottle.   On the other hand, Cueball doesn't have a preference; all of them taste the same for him, so presumably he gets the cheaper ones. White Hat tells Cueball that if he just tried some really good wine and paid more attention he would discover a whole new world.  Cueball's answer is the main message of the comic. He says that wine is no different from anything else in this respect, and makes a list starting with the wine but then going past house music, fonts, ants, Wikipedia signatures ending up with Canadian surrealist porn (Comic 1051 reference). His point is that if you spend enough time focusing one special type of subjects/taste/visual challenges, then you'll become a snobby connoisseur of that topic.   White Hat tries to defend wine by saying that some things have more depth than others (wine being among them), but Cueball challenges him on this by choosing something as obscure as 500 pictures of Joe Biden, the famously gaffe prone Vice President of the United States alongside Barack Obama, eating a sandwich as an example. He claims that if people are locked up in a box with those pictures for a year, they would end up being connoisseur on that subject with the same vehemence regarding the best picture as wine tasters can be about the best wine.  White Hat claims that this is an exaggeration, but Cueball takes this as a challenge so in the last panel, apparently White Hat and Cueball are actually running this experiment to see if they will end up concentrating on slight differences among the placement of mayonnaise on the pictures of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, just in the same way that White Hat concentrates on slight differences among kinds of wine. The result of the experiment is clearly going to Cueball's side, the discussion mainly going on the importance of mayo or the light through lettuce from the sandwiches.  This mentality may also be applied to online groups based on certain subjects (such as television shows, films, and other hobbies and interests), where arguments and vehement, stubborn opinions are common despite the fairly unimportant subject.   The title text presents the same idea in a different wording. The ""scale of our brains"" refers to a concept similar to Richard Dawkins' Middle World, where things too small (say, smaller than the point of a pin) or too big (bigger than what we can see from a mountaintop) are just out of our comprehension, so the things our brains understand must be neither too small nor too big, i.e. the ""middle world"".  However, the title text goes further in this idea: When we find things too big (like the distance to the Moon), we shrink it so that it fits into the ""middle world"" we're used to. Conversely, when we find things too small (say, a mote of dust), we expand it for the same reason. In a quite similar way, if all we have is pictures of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, we ""resize"" that subject so that we can fill books with the details about the pictures.  Specialized interests and the people involved in them are used again, with ants being the subject of 1610: Fire Ants,  typefaces in 590: Papyrus and 736: Cemetery, plastic straws in 1095: Crazy Straws and porn-video quality in 598: Porn.  In 1534: Beer, Cueball also argue slight differences in alcohol brands don't make much difference (in 915 ""Wine all tastes the same to me.""; in 1534, ""maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?"") and people just pretend due to social pressure.","[White Hat is holding a wine glass down in one hand and holding a bottle of wine up in front of him with the other hand. He is looking at the label and talking with Cueball standing next to him with his own filled wine glass in one hand. He is looking down at the glass.] White Hat: How do you stand this cheap wine?

It shows a box, with two star burst on the surface from where two voices emanate from the inside. Over the top left of the panels frame is a small frame with a caption:] A year later: Voice (from left side of the box): Sure, most closed-mouth frames are boring, but in #415, the way the man's jaw frames the mayo on his hand is pure perfection, and— Voice (from right side of the box): What a surprise- you praising a mayo frame.

978: Citogenesis,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/978:_Citogenesis,computers,"I just read a pop-science book by a respected author. One chapter, and much of the thesis, was based around wildly inaccurate data which traced back to... Wikipedia. To encourage people to be on their toes, I'm not going to say what book or author.","This comic is calling into question the reliability of Wikipedia. This is a favorite pastime of librarians and professional researchers, and not usually one of Randall's. But, to take it seriously for a moment: People, Wikipedia is editable by anyone. If you are doing serious work, follow through the citations, and decide which are from upstanding sources, and which are just people writing on their blog, and which are people writing on their blog who know what they are talking about.  The title of the comic is a play on the word cytogenesis. Cytogenesis is the formation of cells and their development. Citogenesis, on the other hand is a portmanteau of 'Citation' and 'Genesis'. A Citation is a reference to a source, used to back up a specific claim. Genesis means the origin of something.  By extension, citogenesis is the creation of text in a reliable source that can be cited to back-up a claim.  The comic is discussing citogenesis occurring on Wikipedia, a free and freely editable encyclopedia that aims to become a comprehensive, neutral compilation of verifiable, established facts.  Wikipedia aims to provide only facts backed by reliable sources. However, this comic strip details a process in which Wikipedia can not only spread misinformation, but make said misinformation seem reliable through a process of ""circular reporting"".  In this distorted process, someone adds an untrue claim to an article in Wikipedia. A writer of some supposedly ""reliable source"" checks Wikipedia for information, and blindly relies on it, without checking for proper sources. Eventually, someone notices the claim in the reliable source, and cites it in the Wikipedia article. The citation then lends further credence to the claim in Wikipedia, so the claim is more likely to be used by other reliable sources, generating a positive-feedback loop.  Four years before, Randall commented on Wikipedia about that process happening to him (on a minor detail), which probably indicates the inception of this comic:  In turn, Randall originated the untrue assertion in this comic that Steven Chu, a physicist, and at the time of the strip the U.S. Secretary of Energy, invented the Scroll lock key, a common button on computer keyboards. Since most people are aware of the scroll lock key but know little about its function or origins, this false information would make for an interesting piece of trivia that would likely spread very quickly.      Following this comic, the actual Scroll lock and Steven Chu articles were both vandalized by ""helpful"" editors trying to project Randall's reality on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia article on Citogenesis redirects to the information loop section on the article ""Reliability of Wikipedia"".  That section ends with crediting the term ""citogenesis"" to ""webcomic artist Randall Munroe"", with a link to this comic. This now has three citations. To make matters even more surreal, some Wikipedia editor once flagged the link to this xkcd comic as ""Dubious - The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or non-factual.""!  We haven't seen a book like the one Randall describes in the title text.  But one example of the misuse of Wikipedia by ""reliable sources"" concerns the former German minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. His complete name contains fifteen names/words and reads: Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg. An anonymous user added one more (""Wilhelm"") to the German Wikipedia, just the evening before Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was presented as the new Federal Minister of Economics and Technology on February 10, 2009. The next day many major German newspapers published this wrong name (translation of bildblog.de).","Where Citations Come From: Citogenesis Step #1 Through a convoluted process, a user's brain generates facts. These are typed into Wikipedia. [A guy with short hair sits at a desk, typing on a laptop.] Guy: (typing) The ""scroll lock"" key was was designed by future Energy Secretary Steven Chu in a college project.  A rushed writer checks Wikipedia for a summary of their subject. [Ponytail sits at a desk, typing on a desktop.] Ponytail: (typing) US Energy Secretary Steven Chu, (Nobel Prizewinner and creator of the ubiquitous ""scroll lock"" key) testified before Congress today... Step #2  Surprised readers check Wikipedia, see the claim, and flag it for review. A passing editor finds the piece and adds it as a citation. [Cueball sits on a couch with a laptop in his lap, typing.] Cueball: Google is your friend, people. (typing) <ref>{{cite web|url= Step #3  Step #4 Now that other writers have a real source, they repeat the fact. [A flow chart, with ""Wikipedia citation"" in the center. The word ""Wikipedia"" is in black, the word ""citations"" is white with a red background. A black arrow leads from ""brain"" to ""Wikipedia."" A black arrow labeled ""words"" leads from ""Wikipedia"" to ""careless writers,"" and a red arrow labeled ""citations"" leads back to ""Wikipedia citations."" A black & red arrow leads from ""Wikipedia"" to ""cited facts"" which leads to ""slightly more careful writers,"" which leads to ""more citations,"" which leads back to :""Wikipedia"" (all black & red arrows).] References proliferate, completing the citogenesis process."
980: Money,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/980:_Money,computers,"There, I showed you it.","This is another chart comic - a type of comic that Randall does from time to time. He has for instance done maps of the Internet (twice!) and other huge visualizations like this chart Radiation with a similar structure as this chart but with Radiation as the subject. The Radiation chart is most likely the inspiration for this much more comprehensive Money chart. In the chart there are five boxes with items on different scales of monetary value. Each scale of dollar increments are different colors. One dollar increments are green - naturally, because American paper money is green. Thousands are Orange/Red. Millions are gray. Billions are yellow. Trillions are blue. This comic uses the short scale for naming large numbers (so a billion = 1000 millions = 109 rather than a million millions = 1012 as in continental Europe). Because the comic is so huge and complex the explanation has been split into several parts and also individual pages: Below are five tables with explanation for some of the items. The transcript is (as is usually the case with huge comics) only given for the text that is visible on the picture shown here above. However the full transcript for all the text in the huge image has also been completed. Finally some tables with prices has been made (although they are not yet complete). In the Billions box there is a vague term called the ""Economic Vortex"" as well as arrows that flow between different blocks of this box. This is to show where the money goes. Where it is collected from, and where it is distributed to. Included in one frame is a small man with a red and white striped shirt, blue pants, a cane and a knit cap. He is known as Wally or Waldo (in the US) from the Where's Waldo books. To not give anything away for those who wish to search for him themselves there will be no spoiler here. But if someone needs a little help... Then by clicking this link you will be directed to the relevant section amongst the five sections where Waldo can be found. (The link will take you to that section of the full transcript page). If you still cannot find him (or give up in advance) then just search the transcript page for Wally or Waldo.

In the case of Wikipedia and other wikis powered by MediaWiki, they are blue for non-visited and purple for visited. In this comic, Randall is ashamed of the pages he has visited, because with the color changes there is evidence of what he has visited in the past, e.g. autoerotic asphyxiation (possibly while researching 682: Force, which features that  very Wikipedia page).  Also the pages that he did visit before are in great contrast with the pages that he hasn't. Pages he didn't click are often difficult, highly intelligent topics, while he only clicks the easy, funny articles with little scientific background on the Wikipedia site.  The title text refers to a common mistake many people make when reading articles on Wikipedia. Words referring to subjects that have an article on Wikipedia are coloured in blue. This, however, can cause confusion when two words leading to two separate articles appear together, as the two links appear to be one. However, on hovering the cursor over the article link, only one word at a time is underlined, showing that the links are separate.  It is not possible to determine who this fake article is supposed to be about, but the Macarena band is certainly from Dos Hermanas, Spain. So, it is quite possibly a made up article from Randall.  If I go for a while without clearing my browser history, I start getting embarrassd by which words on Wikipedia show up in purple.","[the following is in the standard format of a Wikipedia article, modified to reflect the content of the comic.] ...and was a pioneer of literary social realism.

1079: United Shapes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1079:_United_Shapes,computers,That eggplant is in something of a flaccid state.,"In this comic, each state of the United States of America has been filled-in with an object of similar shape. Due to the size range of the states, some states are too small to clearly make-out in the normal size image. Click here to see the large version, which makes every state perfectly clear. Several years later Randall made a new map of the US mainland 1653: United States Map, where he shuffled the positions of the states but filled out the outline. Also in this map Michigan has been split into two separate parts. (Here it is the glove and the eagle).   Very few, if any, of the shapes used are stereotypes of the state; they are merely objects that look like the state. Some of the objects are those which the states are widely known to resemble. For example, Michigan is represented by a glove and an Eagle, and a pot with handle takes the place of Oklahoma (with the panhandle region of the state filled with a literal handle). Others, however, are more creative. Few would have likely pictured Texas as a dog or Alaska as a bear with a jet pack and laser gun. There are several incredibly simple objects filling some states. Kentucky is filled by a cloud, which conceivably could have been used for any state, and Wyoming, one of the nearly rectangular states, is simply an envelope. There are three pairs of states that are related. Georgia and Missouri each contain an image of the other, drawing attention to their similar shapes, North and South Dakota are the top and bottom halves of an amp, and Alabama and Mississippi are moai facing in opposite directions.)  Colorado contains what looks like a Wikipedia article. A close-up of the fake article is provided [1]. The following references are made in the Colorado article:  New Mexico according to Randall's transcript is ""A liquid container labeled for something of unusual and silly danger"". The labeling is upside down and it refers to the nuclear testing facility White Sands Missile Range located in New Mexico for the nuclear bomb.  The title text makes fun of Florida which is sometimes called ""The penis of America"". Obviously, this penis is somewhat flaccid (not erect). The use of the word ""state"" is a pun, as it means some particular condition (flaccid state) as well as a political entity (The State of Florida).",The United Shapes A map of things states are shaped like  [Each state has some item wedged to stay inside its borders]
1087: Cirith Ungol,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1087:_Cirith_Ungol,computers,"My all-time favorite example of syntactic ambiguity comes from Wikipedia: 'Charlotte's Web is a children's novel by American author E. B. White, about a pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by an intelligent spider named Charlotte.'","This comic is a mash-up between the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the novel Charlotte's Web.  The title Cirith Ungol is a reference to Lord of the Rings where Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were led to Cirith Ungol by Gollum and to the lair of the ancient spider Shelob.  And therefore in this comic, Frodo (by himself) is being led into the lair of the spider, Charlotte. We can tell by the ""Some Pig"" writing in the spider web on the lower right hand corner which is a direct reference to the story of Charlotte's Web, in which a spider named Charlotte writes the very same text in her web.  The title text refers to syntactic ambiguity which is a property of sentences which may be reasonably interpreted in more than one way, or reasonably interpreted to mean more than one thing. This allows us to derive two different meanings from the same sentence.   The second part of the title text is a quote from Wikipedia, which Randall enjoys for its  syntactic ambiguity, as it can be logically interpreted in either of the following ways:  This quote was modified the same day the comic appeared [1]. It could be found on Wikiquote until 27 April 2016.  A similar ambiguity explicitly discussed in the title text of 1004: Batman.","[A character in a long flowing robe holds up the Phial of Galadriel in one hand; the One Ring is dangling from a necklace in the other.

1167: Star Trek into Darkness,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1167:_Star_Trek_into_Darkness,computers,"Of course, factions immediately sprang up in favor of '~*~sTaR tReK iNtO dArKnEsS~*~', 'xX_StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNess_Xx', and 'Star Trek lnto Darkness' (that's a lowercase 'L').","The talk page of a Wikipedia article is used to discuss changes to the article. An edit war is a dispute about a specific edit to an article, manifesting as a series of edits alternating between making and reverting the change, and usually accompanied by a more-or-less heated debate on the talk page.  Here, Randall is referring to a dispute on the Wikipedia article about Star Trek lnto Darkness (an upcoming Star Trek film at the time of the comic's posting). On the day before the comic was published, the article name had a lowercase ""into"", and the talk page looked like this (rounded off in a friendly way, with the posting of a summary of the arguments, and an exchange of virtual hugs). In summary, the debate centers around whether ""Into Darkness"" should be treated as a prepositional phrase or an unpunctuated subtitle (as in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness""), whether compound prepositions like ""into"" should be capitalized in titles, and whether the capitalization of the title in the movie's official promotional material is relevant. The intensity and multiple facets of a debate over one tiny letter is apparently entertaining to Randall.  Cueball changes the title so that every other letter is capitalized, and adds framing tildes and asterisks (a common, but childish and ugly way of emphasizing titles online). This will probably not go over well.  Megan's line of ""They should have sent a poet."" is a quote from the film Contact. The quote is also featured in 482: Height.  In the movie, the line was meant to convey that only a poet could adequately capture the beauty seen; here, it indicates that prose is insufficient to capture the ironic beauty of the edit war.  The title text indicates Randall's belief that such arguments are perpetual and will always arise. He suggests that the edit to the Wikipedia page will result in a dispute over variants of Cueballs ""compromise"". Because the lowercase ""L"" and the capital ""I"" appear similar in many fonts, he also puts forth the potential argument that the character in the movie's title is a lowercase ""L"".  The old ""favorite edit war"" might be the one referenced in the title text of 878: Model Rail or the one resulting from the addition of the 739: Malamanteau article to Wikipedia  After the publication of the comic, the debate continued with full force, complete with a section of xkcd-inspired suggestions. The article itself was soon protected, so that only administrators could edit it. A day later, the title was changed to one including a capital ""Into"" by the administrator Mackensen. (The debate continued on his talk page.) Currently https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/~*~_StAr_TrEk_InTo_DaRkNeSs_~*~ is a valid link and it redirects to the correct page, but this redirect was nominated for deletion and kept in 2015.  The Independent published an article about the ""grammatical tizzy"", and the affair as a whole was added to Wikipedia's humorous list of the lamest edit wars.","[Cueball staring at computer screen.] Cueball: Oh, wow. Look at Wikipedia's Talk page for Star Trek into Darkness. I have a new favorite edit war. Megan (off-panel): Oh?

1331: Frequency,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1331:_Frequency,computers,"This comic shows estimated average frequency. I wanted to include the pitch drop experiment, but it turns out the gif format has some issues with decade-long loops.","This comic shows a number of common events, arranged in a grid. Each of the events flashes with its average frequency.   For example, statistically a child is born somewhere on the world approximately every 0.24 seconds, or four times per second. Therefore, the tile ""One birth"" blinks about 4 times per second.  The title text refers to the Pitch drop experiment which measures the flow of a piece of pitch over many years. At room temperature, tar pitch flows at a very slow rate, taking several years to form a single drop. The title text jokes that Randall tried to include a tile that flashes about once every ten years, but the tiles are all animated GIFs and while the file format supports animations of any length, the resulting file would be too big (at least 10 megabytes).  A thorough analysis of the frequencies present in this comic and how they relate to the underlying technology (the GIF format) was published as Reverse Engineering xkcd's 'Frequency'.

It is a list of Wikipedia article titles that are in the same syllable-stress pattern as the first line of the theme song of the 1987 cartoon series.  The list is compiled in alphabetical order from top to bottom, without respect to the left or right column. Some of the items on this list (e.g. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) are drawn as headlines in the same style as the logo from that series. These articles are not in alphabetical order with the surrounding small face text, but these headlines are in alphabetical order with the other headlines from top to bottom, without respect to the left or right column. Some of these phrases are not actually the titles of Wikipedia articles, but are redirects. For instance, the article on Woodrow Wilson ""Woody"" Guthrie redirects to Woody Guthrie, and Former Arctic Monkeys members redirects to Andy Nicholson.  The syllable-stress pattern of this line is long-short-long-short-long-short-long-short, known in poetry as trochaic tetrameter. Randall has previously authored comics dealing with trochees, namely 856: Trochee Fixation and 1383: Magic Words.  A similar idea was performed by Jimmy Fallon in 2001 at a concert for New York city where he demonstrated singing ""any 80's song"" over the tune of MC Hammer's song ""U Can't Touch This"".  The title text suggests an album of songs (The Purple People Eater, the aforementioned Ninja Turtles theme, Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini and the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers theme), the title or primary refrain of which have a large number of verses in trochaic meter. Randall suggests that these refrains are so interchangeable that the lyrics of each could be sung to the melody of the song following it in the tracklist. Randall would title the album Linked List as each song would melodically reference the next song.

It is a portmanteau of the words brother, meaning a close male friend (aka ""bro""), and romance.  Although current in popular media, some commentators have criticized the implicit homophobia in the term, suggesting that it denotes cultural discomfort at relationships of emotional closeness between men. [1]  In this comic, Randall is implying the Wikipedia page for the word ""bromance"" should more accurately represent what most bromances actually are: friendships. This could be a joke to reference the fact that some males prefer to not call friendships as such, for fear of looking unmasculine, or being confused as a gay couple. The comic makes light of the fact that the word bromance and friendship are interchangeable, and should be treated as such.  The comic later contains parts of the edited article, mocking the use of ""bromance"" in popular culture, implying that ""friendships"" can be used just as easily to describe platonic male relationships.  Despite supposedly vandalizing the ""bromance"" article, the article is titled ""friendship"", giving a similar result to word-replacement browser extensions, as in 1031: s/keyboard/leopard/. It is also possible, however, that a {{DISPLAYTITLE:Friendship}} tag was added to the article's source code to cause the page's name to display as such.  The title text implies Randall does not agree with Wikipedia vandalism, except in the case of bromance/friendship, and also militia/fanclub, possibly to make light of the harsh sounding word in a negative light.  In the wake of this comic, several Wikipedia pages were vandalized, among them Bromance, Militia organizations in the United States, Militia (United States), and Friendship. All these pages were semi-protected by an administrator against further attempts for a week after this comic was published.

Items near the bottom-left corner (such as Randall's absent-mindedness regarding ice cream) have a clear explanation and are not really strange either. Items near the top-left corner (such as the meaning of You're So Vain) are mysterious but not really strange. Items near the bottom-right corner (such as the Dyatlov Pass incident) have a clear explanation but are quite strange.   The title text refers to the mystery of Randall staying up late to read Wikipedia articles, when he was already supposed to be asleep an hour ago.

1521: Sword in the Stone,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1521:_Sword_in_the_Stone,computers,That seems like an awful lot of hassle when all I wanted was a cool sword.,"In this comic, Megan pulls a sword out of a stone. A flash of light comes down and music plays, and a heavenly voice tells her she has ascended to the throne of England. Megan then pulls out her phone and searches on Wikipedia for England . After having read for a while she begins, while reading on, to replace the sword into the rock.  The comic references the fables of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. In Arthurian legend, whoever can remove The Sword in the Stone is the lawful king of Britain (although this comic, like some versions of the legend, refers only to England). Arthur is an orphan being raised in secret; he notices the sword, removes it, and is proclaimed king. The sword is sometimes identified as Excalibur, although in other versions Excalibur was acquired by King Arthur from the Lady of the Lake. The most familiar version of this story is The Sword in the Stone by T. H. White which is based on Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory. The animated musical by Walt Disney is a well known version of this fairytale based on White's book.  A key element in the joke is that as Megan begins to read about England, especially information concerning being an English ruler, she quickly thinks better of this and begins to put the sword back in its place. The punchline that Megan puts the sword back after reading about England suggests that the ""gift"" of being the leader of England is not worth the risk and/or work associated. British history is rife with monarchic strife, and a brief inquiry into their causes of death will show that almost one in three British rulers have died either in battle or from murder, etc. This would quickly lead most sane people to conclude that the risks associated with ruling England far outweigh the benefits.  The title text furthers this plot, having Megan comment on the hassle when the only thing she was interested in was the cool sword. Apparently Megan is not enthusiastic about power, and her choice is made when she sees how problematic it could be to reign over the country of England. There is also a subtle play on the fact that in the T. H. White version, Arthur likewise is unaware of the significance of pulling the sword from the stone; he is simply looking for a sword to replace the one belonging to his step-brother Kay that was stolen under his watch, to avoid embarrassment and reproach.  From the time of the Roman Empire all the way up to Charles II's reclamation of the throne, the area now known as England has seen several migration waves, Viking raids, invasions and fierce power struggles among aristocratic families. Besides the constant threat of usurpation, as evidenced by the numerous wars for the crown, such as the Norman conquest and the War of the Roses, there were also constant difficulties in managing the frontier regions. This can be seen from Hadrian's Wall, a creation of the titular Roman Emperor designed to keep the ever difficult Scots out of the areas of Roman control (the Scots would be a constant problem for England up until the reign of King James VI and I; think of the movie Braveheart for a good example of the regular headaches they caused, seen from the English point of view), as well as the Welsh uprisings that occurred with such consistency that you could set your watch by them.  It is worth emphasizing that the term ""England"" is anachronistic in this context. At the time Arthur supposedly existed, there was no England — England was formed by Germanic tribes who settled in Britain between the fifth and seventh centuries. In many of the stories, including the earliest, Arthur was in fact was depicted as a leader of the native Romano-Britons in their attempts to repel these invaders. England would not exist had Arthur succeeded. The anachronism is not new; it entered Arthurian legend in the Middle Ages. (Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, for example, refers to Arthur as King of England.) In Arthurian legend it was stated that Arthur would return when needed (in some versions he was explicitly associated with the Mab Darogan, a Welsh Messianic figure who would finally drive the English out of Britain and reclaim it for the native Britons).  It is possible that Megan in this comic is a 21st-century reincarnation of Arthur.  The timing of this comic might relate to the birth of princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana on May 2, 2015 just four days before this comic, and the burden of a royal of having a whole life in public shaking hands of strangers. Since 2013 the line of succession was changed to absolute primogeniture, meaning that she will keep her current position in the line (4th after her older brother) even if she later gets baby brothers. Before this year, that would not have been the case, as the male gender took rank over birth order.  It is also probably not a coincidence that this comic was published the day before the UK General Election, occurring on May 7, 2015. This election decides the modern-day leader of the UK. And the problems they face today, may even be more likely to cause Megan to give away the throne, than the risk of untimely death she would have faced in Arthur's days.

1551: Pluto,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1551:_Pluto,computers,"After decades of increasingly confused arguing, Pluto is reclassified as a ""dwarf Pluto.""","This comic was posted on Tuesday, July 14, 2015, in honor of the New Horizons deep space probe making its flyby at Pluto, thus breaking the typical Monday/Wednesday/Friday cycle for the xkcd comics. Also on this day he released the first what if? in over three months, and it was called New Horizons. Luckily it did not end up back on Earth, as depicted in 1532: New Horizons, released 1½ month before closest approach.  Randall has taken one of the probes images of Pluto, and outlined humorous examples of pareidolia on top of it.  It can be compared to preliminary descriptions by geologists, e.g. New Horizons' best look at Pluto before close approach|The Planetary Society.  The comic probably winks at Percival Lowell whose observatory photographed Pluto in 1915 ""known"" as Planet X. Unfortunately Percival Lowell is most famous for are his drawings of the Canals on Mars which are widely misunderstood as channels based on wrong translations from Italian to other languages.  The title text refers to the debate as to whether Pluto should be classified as a full or dwarf planet. This debate was particularly brought into the public eye, and came to be seen as a matter of controversy, following the 2006 IAU definition of planet. The text may imagine that this debate winds on, with definitions being created and revised until a ridiculous state is reached whereby Pluto has a special class of celestial body named after it called a 'Pluto', but fails to fulfill the arbitrary criteria set up for it, and hence is called a 'dwarf Pluto'.  There actually exist the terms Plutoid and Plutino, that relate directly to groups that Pluto belongs to, but see those pages for details of their use and usage.  Suggests Pluto is a confection, like Minmus. May also be a reference to the Mars candy bar.  The JPEG image format has the common issue of slightly distorting an image with Compression artifacts. The artifacts shown here do not appear in the official version of this image, but all data sent from New Horizons is compressed and artifacts are common — the full resolution images will be submitted to earth over the next 16 months. There have been tweets about people seeing plumes associated with active volcanoes and the like, which were explained as being artifacts.  Interpreting Pluto as a head, the frontal bone could be the light-colored region next to the darker top, just above the north pole facing to us.    The area above Pluto's north pole is attributed to grease.  Could refer to possible extraterrestrial life on Pluto in the form of insects, or ""bugs"". In the animated TV series Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles, an adaptation of Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers, the first battles with the alien ""Bugs"" took place on Pluto. Maybe it also refers to a software bug at the probe.  A string of small round features which Randall suggests were the result of Pluto getting shot repeatedly, probably by meteorites.  Reference to the what if?, Drain the Oceans: Part II, about draining the Earth's oceans onto Mars. In the previous what if?, Drain the Oceans, the Netherlands took over the Earth once their problem with the risk of flooding disappeared. And then they continued to issued forth from the portal that drained the oceans on Earth pouring them onto Mars, to claim Mars as New Netherlands. Presumably something similar happened on Pluto. This was already again references in both an entry in the table and in the title text of 1555: Exoplanet Names 2.  Since the base photograph is identified as ""today's New Horizons image,"" this indicates that a section of Pluto has immediately become the subject of some controversy, possibly a territorial claim or one of several references to the fact that Pluto was demoted from full planet status in 2006.  A generic map hazard.  Pareidolia is the human brain's tendency to see patterns where they don't exist. While probably a reference to Pluto's heart, the joke is also recursive: You'd be seeing the text of a Wikipedia article explaining to you that you couldn't actually be seeing the text of a Wikipedia article.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  The Kuiper belt is a region in our solar system that contains an unknown amount of icy bodies, one known is Pluto. Randall jokingly refers to Kuiper Belt as the same kind of belt that's used to fasten clothing, and identifies features on Pluto's surface as loops for the belt.  An outline of the Firefly-class spaceship Serenity, which was the titular vessel from the 2002 TV series Firefly. One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  Nobody can see a dinosaur unless Randall did do this painting on Pluto's surface. And a complex comic needs at least one dinosaur.  A section of Pluto that is objectively better than the rest.  This could be interpreted as a moon growing/emerging out of pluto, as a bud is ""a compact knob-like growth"". A round growth is seen at the location marked, resembling a small, emerging moon.  A reference to the classic video game Pacman, wherein the primary antagonists are one of four Ghosts. The Ghost on Pluto appears to have a mouth, however, unlike most depictions of the Pacman Ghosts. One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  Suggests Pluto had dinosaurs and lost them the same way Earth did.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined, and the only one (currently) also informally named as such by NASA.  Also known as ischemic heart disease, which causes degradation of heart tissue.  The region identified in the comic looks less 'healthy' (is darker and more ragged) compared to the rest of the 'Heart', which Randall suggests is caused by the disease.  Referring to the general practice of naming extraterrestrial mountains ""X Mons"" (e.g. Olympus Mons, a mountain on Mars and the largest mountain in the Solar System), as well as naming terrestrial mountains ""Mount X"". Since ""mons"" is Latin for ""mountain"", the feature's suggested name translates as ""Mount Mountain"".  A terrain feature suitable for connecting an outside source of electricity for the benefit of implied internal batteries. Compare ""dock connector,"" below.  Implying that Pluto is some manner of giant egg. Possibly a reference to the Doctor Who episode Kill the Moon, in which the Moon is revealed to be an egg from which a monster is hatching. A 2014 article from The Onion, ""Moon Finally Hatches,"" makes the same joke. Also possibly a reference to The Light Fantastic, a Discworld novel in which similar objects are revealed to be the eggs of the world turtle. A similar idea appeared in Jack Williamson's 1934 short story ""Born of the Sun"".  Balls often have a ""plug"" or opening to insert a needle to inflate or deflate them.  Since it's all-caps, we can't tell if ""PREDATOR"" is a proper noun, but this is possibly a reference to the movie series Predator, about a race of aliens who hunt other beings for sport. Alternatively, a planetary predator (such as comic book villain Galactus) may have previously scarred Pluto.  The structure indicated is a small black dot (at least at this distance this picture was taken). Reset buttons on home electronics are often small buttons or holes used to reset the software of the electronic device.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined, this one in the shape of a popular video game protagonist.  Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet rather than a planet following the latter term's controversial redefinition in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.  Arguments about the classification continue to pop up. The same argument is referenced in the title text. The name implies a proposal to put all the people still arguing about it in this hole on Pluto. This proposal further implies that the continued debate is very annoying by 2015, except perhaps to the debaters themselves.  The area indicated is near the terminator and shows some intriguing topographic relief.   A neoplasm or tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue. Randall is suggesting that the abnormal region near the heart has been evaluated by a doctor and determined to be benign.  Suggests the discrepancy in color over Pluto's surface may be a function of what cake frosting was used where. This area is the ""dark spot"" at the head of the ""whale"" (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/14/science/space/pluto-flyby.html).  The so-called ""whale's tail"" (http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/find-heart-whale-new-horizons-picture-pluto-n388816), is on the other hemisphere and is not visible in this image, it lies east about 90 degrees from the chocolate frosting/dark spot here.  As above, suggests the discrepancy in color over Pluto's surface may be a function of what cake frosting was used where.  A reference to the Disney animated feature The Lion King. In the movie, the Pridelands is the bright and prosperous region ruled by the Lion King while a dark territory beyond its border is controlled by hyenas.  A continuation of the Lion King reference above.  From the point of view of the photograph, this feature of Pluto is at the planet's ""bottom,"" where iPod dock connectors are.

1665: City Talk Pages,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1665:_City_Talk_Pages,computers,I don't think the Lakeshore Air Crash Museum really belongs under 'Tourist Attractions.' It's not a museum--it's just an area near the Lake Festival Laser Show where a lot of planes have crashed,"The comic makes fun of Wikipedia talk pages. On Wikipedia, every article has a place to discuss the content of the page, called a talk page"". In this case, the comic talks about the talk page of an article about a city. While some of the topics are quite normal for such a page (e.g. the quality of the images) others are not (e.g. too many murders and mine disasters in the city). The topics discussed suggest that the city has many problems and is a bad place to live in or visit.  The topics show a common problem at Wikipedia's talk pages: People often use them as a place to talk about the subject of the article, but it is for talking about the article itself. Someone at the top of the talk page is suggesting a better name for the city.  The article repeatedly refers to ""the murders"", suggesting that the city might be well-known for them. It seems that the editors cannot agree on how notable ""the murders"" are. ""Not that notable"" refers to Wikipedia's general criteria for including information in articles. Material which is not noteworthy should be removed; however, different editors often disagree about what is notable, resulting in conflicting edits as text is inserted and then removed (an ""edit war""). Someone replies that ""all cities have murders"". While true, many cities in low-crime countries would not have a series of them so well-known that when someone talks about ""the murders"" any reader could be expected to know what they are talking about, making this sound like an attempt to make the city sound nicer than it is. ""I think the murderer is reverting my edits"" suggests the murders are being committed by one person who is influencing how they are shown on Wikipedia - perhaps trying to prevent Wikipedia from publishing evidence of them or possibly publicise them by adding more information about them. This raises the possibility that the discussion of the murder visible in the infobox picture may have been initiated by the murderer.  The infobox is a short fact sheet that many articles in the (English) Wikipedia have; it generally includes an image illustrating the subject of the article. The question of which picture is best for the infobox (because this image is so prominent) can cause edit wars. It emerges that the photograph of the city has a murder in it. Instead of forwarding the picture to law enforcement, someone uses the image editing software Photoshop to erase the murder so the picture will be less objectionable. It appears that murders are so common in the city that any random photograph of the city has a chance of showing a murder, to the point where a second photo proposed as a replacement for the infobox picture is found to show another murder.  Voltaire was a French Enlightenment writer. As a prominent and very opinionated intellectual, he gets a lot of quotes falsely attributed to him; most famously, he did not actually say ""I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"" (that was Evelyn Beatrice Hall).  It seems that the people who are editing the article are getting desperate to find a non-bleak picture of the city. When a non-bleak picture is added, it turns out to be from the 2016 Disney film Zootopia. The fictional city which is the setting and title of the film has a distinctive look which is far from bleak, but is not a picture of the city. (Zootopia is called Zootropolis in many European countries for trademark reasons.)  The city apparently is a mining city and there have been some mining disasters. An editor is complaining that this section is too long, but another editor points out that this is because there have been so many mining disasters that a large section is needed to cover the topic.   1982 Secession refers to Key West, Florida seceding from the United States in 1982 to form the Conch Republic.  A known problem on Wikipedia is ""coatracking"", where people use articles to promote topics that are not strictly the subject of the article (perhaps by writing far more about them than is necessary, when they could just be mentioned in passing). Here, it emerges that the article on a city expresses a dubious opinion on condom use. This is against several Wikipedia policies: it would be irrelevant to the article and sounds like an editor's attempt to publicise their views.  Andrew Lloyd Webber is an English composer famous for writing The Phantom Of The Opera. Webber is also known for writing the music for Starlight Express, a rock opera about anthropomorphized trains, which is probably another factor in the train station joke. Meanwhile, Frank Lloyd Wright, who shares his middle name and last initial, was an American architect, who designed more than 1,000 structures. As it turns out it was the composer who was responsible for the train station, and as a result the station roof has collapsed.  It is complained that the article is promoting the ""Lake Festival Laser Show"" too much. In the alt text, it emerges that the laser show is so impressive that it has caused a number of aeroplanes to crash. This probably refers to the fact that laser pointers should not be aimed at aircrafts, as they can be distracting to the pilots. The article has been promoting this area of crashed planes as the ""Lakeshore Air Crash Museum"", despite it not having any educational purpose.","[Caption above the panel: ] I love reading the Wikipedia talk pages for articles on individual cites  [A list of contents for a Wikipedia talk page regarding an article about a city.

1757: November 2016,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1757:_November_2016,computers,"Once you've done this, make a note of how old they were. Then, when their age reaches double that, show them this chart again.","This is yet another comic designed to make you feel old, following soon after the last one 1745: Record Scratch. Not so long ago a comic with the very title of the largest bold letters in the caption above the panel was released: 1686: Feel Old. The next comic about feeling old, was released 11 months later, with a similar title, which is special in it self, 1898: October 2017 see more on both title and this follow up comic in the trivia section below.  Specifically this comic contains The November 2016 Guide to making people feel old. (The  unusual title for the comic indicates that it only works during this month). It lists ages between 16 and 41 and links each age to one or more events that happened approximately half that age ago, so 8 years ago for the 16 years old and 20 years ago for the 40 years old etc, which means that a person of that age would have had the mentioned thing in their life for the majority of their life. And then it explains that to make a person of a given [age] feel old, look up the [thing] (or things) connected to it, and say:      As an example the age 21 can be used, as it list both the Xbox 360 as well as this comic, xkcd itself. The two possible sentences would then be:  This matches earlier attempts to make people feel old by mentioning how long ago it was that, for instance, a movie comes out as was the case in 891: Movie Ages. (But on this exact day when the comic was released there might have many people who did already feel old an tired - see trivia). When an event seems to have occurred recently to you, like seeing a movie when you were twenty (with Toy Story) and then suddenly realizing that this was 21 years ago, you will very likely feel old. Since humans' perception of time is not related to how much time has actually passed but rather to important memories, then memories like seeing the first feature-length fully computer-animated movie (Toy Story) makes a big impression and may stay vivid in peoples' memories. When they then, after hearing the sentence from this comic, realize that more than half their life has passed since that event, they realize how much time has passed and that makes them feel old.  This is why it affects a 20-year-old to hear that Twitter is ten years old, where this will not have the same impact on a 16-year-old, since they were so young when it came out that they probably feel like it has been around for ever, and you do not feel old by hearing, for instance, something like that the TV was invented before you were born. It thus makes sense to pick something that happened almost midway through a person's life, because they then realize they are now double as old as when they first heard of Twitter. Of course also many ten years old would not have been active on Twitter when it was released, so it may not have that big an impact on those 20 years old today.  Actually many of the chosen things are something that Randall specifically has interest in and several of the chosen events or movies relates to things that are recurring subjects in xkcd, as can be seen by the long list of categories that belongs to this comic. And while movie series like Star Wars, The Matrix, X-Men, Shrek and Toy Story are probably well known to most of xkcd readers as are games like The Sims and Pokémon, books like Harry Potter and comics like Calvin and Hobbes, then there are other things that are either only known to xkcd readers, basically not to anyone or at least not to people who where only 8-12 years old when the thing occurred. And if the person was not even aware of the specific thing existing, or at least not aware of it at the time when it was new, then the impact of saying the sentence to them will be little to none. Basically the first three ages, 16-18 years, would fall into this category. At 8 years old you are not supposed to play any version of Grand Theft Auto (not that some might not do it), and Rickrolling is also mainly for young adults, not 8-9 years old children. Worst of all is the reference for age 18 to the, probably mostly unknown, movie Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, which is directed at adults, and thus definitely not at those children that where 9 years old when it was released.    Nintendo Wii for people at 10 years old is the first that might make an impact, as will Xbox 360, but then again not xkcd, which is not directed at 10-11 years old children. But, the entire comic is mainly made to make readers of xkcd feel old by letting them know how long all these items are. But for the big movies and events that most people know about, it might also work on people not interested in xkcd. See more regarding if the sentence would work or not in the table below.  The joke at the end is that people over 41 don't need anything to make them feel old, because they already feel old. He thus teases people above 41 years old by claiming they are old, although many people (above 40) would claim you are not old before you retire. This trick was also used to cap the above mentioned 891: Movie Ages to 35 years old, stating anyone as older was already old. But that comic was also released five years ago, and now Randall is himself closing in on 35 at 32 years at the time of this comics release. So he pushed the limit 6 years further, probably for this reason. Now he no longer thinks people at 36 are too old to try to make them feel old.  It may be a coincidence, but still interesting, that he stopped the list just before 42, a number Randall has referred to many times in relation to it being the ""Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"" in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  For something to have existed for the majority of someones life, it is supposed to be older than half the persons age, but it seems Randall went for just about half the age. For instance for a 35-year-old person (born 1981), it lists the release of the movie The Matrix, which was released March 31, 1999 making it very close to 17.5 years ago, fitting with half of 35 years. For the 41-year-old it is slightly more than half of their life that has included the movie Toy Story, which was released almost exactly 21 years before this comic in November 1995, compared to the 20.5 years from half of 41 years. The only entry on the list that seems to veer more than half a year from the half age is  the one for autotuned hit songs which seems to refer to 1998, maybe specifically starting with Cher's song Believe released on October 19, 1998, making it 18 years ago. But it is listed together with the age 33 years, which should thus have been connected with something around 16.5 years old (16-17 years). However, this entry is also one of the less time specific. However, the rule still applies, it's just the only one where it is such a big majority of the persons age (18 years in their life 15 years not in their life). See more in the table below.  The title text points out that the same chart can be used for the same person once they are twice as old. So it urges the user to note down the age of the person it was used on, and then wait until their age reaches double that. So for a 16-year-old that would only be 16 more years until they are 32, but for a 41-year-old it would have to wait until they are 82 years old. When showing them this chart, they will realize that this has existed for half of their life and again have the same type of ""feeling old"" that this comic is supposed to instigate today.(It will work better if they still remember the joke made on them those many years ago)...","[Caption above the panel:] The November 2016 Guide to making people feel old  [A chart with a list of items to be put into the two first lines above the chart.

Hairy then accidentally public confesses that he has actually been up to some late-night Wikipedia browsing and reading about maritime disasters.  In the caption Randall confesses that he loves traveling, because he can then use jet lag as a nice excuse for what is actually his usual messed up sleep cycle.  In the title text, Randall states that he had to do some important research. But what he lists, are clearly also just topics he read in Wikipedia: proposed interstellar space missions, basketball statistics, canceled skyscrapers, and every article linked from ""Women in warfare and the military in the 19th century."" Randall has earlier illustrated this issue in 214: The Problem with Wikipedia.  Randall has previously discussed his oft-changing sleep cycle in 320: 28-Hour Day and 448: Good Morning, and has alluded to it more subtly in 68: Five Thirty, 92: Sunrise, and 776: Still No Sleep. We can thus see that this is a habit of Randall's that has persisted for more than a decade, as has his obsession with Wikipedia.","[Hairy, with more messed up hair than usual, is rubbing his eyes while small ""sleepy"" bubbles form over his head, while walking towards Ponytail.] Hairy: Sorry, I just woke up. Ponytail: It's 3 PM! ...Oh, of course, you're still jet lagged. Hairy: I-yeah, that's it! I definitely didn't spend half the night reading Wikipedia articles about random maritime disasters.  [Caption below the panel:] I love traveling, because my sleep schedule is as messed up as always, but suddenly I have an excuse."
202: YouTube,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/202:_YouTube,computers,I pray GunPistolMan never learns the word 'sheeple'.,"This comic is pointing out the fact that many of the comments on YouTube videos are insipid and poorly informed, being pointless arguments over some minor topic or factually incorrect position. In this case, the Moon landing hoaxers are at the receiving end of Randall's pen.  This comic was published in December 2006. In July 2009, a restored video showing Neil Armstrong's first moonwalk was uploaded to YouTube. User Michael Huang copied to that video's comments section all the sentences in this comic. Then, after some other users took some of his comments seriously, he later added another comment stating, ""This entire comment chain is from the famous webcomic, xkcd."" The comments are copied verbatim, including typos and grammar errors. The only mistake is in the first comment: Michael Huang included only one question mark when the comic has three of them.  The title text is the first reference to Sheeple, which appeared a few more times in xkcd comics. The reputation of YouTube comment threads as cesspools of abject stupidity and blatant trolling is revisited in 301: Limerick and 481: Listen to Yourself. The username CrackMonkey74 appears again in 406: Venting and 574: Swine Flu.","The Internet has always had loud dumb people, but I've never seen anything quite as bad as the people who comment on YouTube videos.

462: Freemanic Paracusia,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/462:_Freemanic_Paracusia,computers,It's amazing what it does for YouTube comments.,"Paracusia is a form of hallucination that involves perceiving sounds without auditory stimulus.  Morgan Freeman is an American actor who may be best known as the character Red in The Shawshank Redemption, where he is also the narrator. He narrates because he is especially known for his soothing and mellow voice, which helps him amplify performances in minor parts, such as God in Bruce Almighty. He has been a narrator of many TV programs and also narrated the major film War of the Worlds where he did not play any other part.  The comic is a play on the combination of the two. The idea is that while reading a text, instead of hearing you own voice in your mind's ear, you substitute it for Freeman's voice, giving a new perspective on the contents of the text. Here, the voice of Morgan Freeman converts the most annoying possible thing on the web (penis enlargement advertisements) into a soothing meditation.  The title text suggests to apply this specifically on the mostly stupid comments on YouTube, like those found in 202: YouTube.","[Cueball is sitting behind a desk with a computer.] Freemanic Paracusia: A disorder wherein you hear everything you read in the comforting voice of Morgan Freeman. [There is a thought bubble of Cueball's thoughts, within it is Morgan Freeman reading text.] Morgan Freeman: Why, you could enlarge your penis for cheap. My, my. Isn't that something."
481: Listen to Yourself,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/481:_Listen_to_Yourself,computers,"Man, I just wanted to know how babby was formed.","YouTube is a website for video sharing where anyone can upload and view videos. It is notorious for having some of the most ridiculous, hateful, mean-spirited, nonsensical comments of any mainstream website (a reputation touched upon earlier in 202: YouTube).  Danish tells Black Hat that her computer virus reads a YouTube user's comments back to them before it is submitted. Upon hearing their own ridiculous comments read aloud to them, they will realize the stupidity of it and not submit the comment. YouTube later made this a real feature, although it has since been removed again.  The title text is in reference to a post left on the Yahoo! Answers website in 2006 by a submitter known as ""kavya,"" who asks ""how is babby formed / how girl get pragnent."" The post picked up internet popularity and spawned several flash animations. This was again mentioned in 522: Google Trends and in 550: Density.","[Black Hat approaches Danish typing at a computer.] Black Hat: What are you writing? Danish: Virus. Black Hat: What's it do?

920: YouTube Parties,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/920:_YouTube_Parties,computers,"This reminds me of that video where... no? How have you not seen that? Oh man, let me find it. No, it's ok, we can go back to your video later.","A YouTube party is when a group of people show each other YouTube videos. The problem with YouTube parties is that no one pays attention to the video that's playing; instead, each person is thinking of the video that they personally want to play next.  You can see analogous behavior at any get-together where couples (parents) are telling stories about their kids. Nobody cares about anybody else's kid; they are just waiting (not even listening) until they get the chance to talk about their own offspring.  The joke seems to be that everybody is doing this, but it is unclear whether they realize it. They each seem to be under the delusion that the others will be fascinated by ""their"" video (or child's accomplishments), even though the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. Possibly they don't care about that either; they just want an audience, even an unwilling one.  This may be defensible where kids are involved, because the parents could reasonably feel that the accomplishments of their children reflect well on themselves. However, the people in the YouTube party didn't create the videos, they just found them. Which makes their behavior (or perhaps YouTube parties in general) even more insane and pointless.  The title text reiterates this point. The speaker is reminded of another video that is so superior to the one currently playing that we should find it and watch it immediately. We can always go back to the current video later (if anybody still remembers, that is; and according to the comic above no one will want to remember it).","[Cueball and a group are standing in a dark room around a table. The group and Cueball are illuminated by a laptop on the table.] The problem with YouTube parties: Cueball (thinking): This video is blowing their MINDS. Group (thinking): Oh man, I know what video we should watch once this is over."
1804: Video Content,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1804:_Video_Content,computers,"So, like, sexy news videos? ""No, people have tried that--it's still just video content. We need to actually inform people THROUGH making out. I would call it 'Mouth Content,' but I think that's already the title of a Neil Cicierega album.""","This comic is a commentary on the declining publishing industry and their unsuccessful attempts at regaining an audience.  News media has evolved dramatically as the world entered the information era.  Newspapers, which were at one point the most widely distributed and consumed form of media, have rapidly been eclipsed by new technologies such as television, Internet, and streaming video.  Subscriptions to paper-based media have been drastically declining to the point where many publishers are on the verge of shutting down.  While publishers are making an effort to move their content to newer, more popular forms of media, in many cases they are still clearly behind the times.  The comic illustrates one such example with Cueball suggesting presenting news stories as videos rather than text. This is presented and received by Megan, Hairbun and Hairy as a clever new idea that would appeal to young people based on the fact that they like watching YouTube videos. However, apparently no one in the comic has realized that television news programs have been filling such a niche for decades and that young people are just as uninterested. In fact, online video based news is often considered annoying, especially if autoplaying or if there is no text based alternative. In reality, this idea is not at all original and likely to be doomed to fail from the start.  As with many similar attempts, the new ""ideas"" that publishers are trying to adopt are merely cramming news content into things young people like, without really understanding why they like it and without considering whether news would be a good fit.  In the caption, Randall suggests it would be pointless to argue with newspaper publishers about their ideas.  Presumably Randall believes publishers who fall for those ideas are already out of touch with the new generation, and would not be able to understand why those ideas lack merit.  Instead, he suggests taking the trend to a ridiculous extreme, by telling publishers that young people like making out.  Suppose publishers follow the same pattern and try to cram news into this as well, they would end up creating some form of news program centered around making out.  The results may turn out completely laughable or highly entertaining.  If the former, it could serve as a wake-up call to publishers that they need to reconsider their approach.  If the latter, then it could actually become a trend and unexpectedly reinvigorate the industry.  In the title text it seems like the news agency actually consider this idea, or is at least confused enough to ask. Their interpretation of combining ""making out"" with news is to make it sexy, but the next speaker says that this has been tried before and doesn't work. This is likely a reference to Naked News [link potentially NSFW], a news program that does that: it features attractive women delivering the news while simultaneously disrobing. This concept has not, for some reason, spread to the mainstream.  According to the speaker, merely making the news sexy is not enough – the news content must be directly integrated into the making out; how this would be accomplished is as yet unclear.  The title text also dismisses the proposed name Mouth Content as possibly the title of a Neil Cicierega album, in reference to his recently-released Mouth Moods, as well as his prior albums Mouth Sounds and Mouth Silence.","[From left to right: Hairy, Cueball, Megan and Hairbun sit around a conference table.] Cueball: Research shows young people like YouTube, so we should present news stories as videos instead of text! Megan: Good idea! Hairbun: They'll love that!  [Caption below the panel:] Instead of arguing with newspapers about this, we should just tell them how much young people like making out and see what happens."
1836: Okeanos,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1836:_Okeanos,computers,WHEN I WAS ON A BOAT I DROPPED MY PHONE CAN U LOOK FOR IT,"The NOAAS Okeanos Explorer, named after the Greek (and Roman) personification of the sea Okeanos, is a vessel that is currently exploring the Central Pacific Basin. It livestreams the video feed [1] of its deep sea exploration online.   This comic seems to be a representation of the livestream on YouTube [2]; see the table below for details.   The chat section for the actual livestream is disabled, but the comic adds some humorous examples of what the chat section would look like.  Several of the examples are the product of commenters falsely believing the livestream is that of a game, probably since most livestreams on YouTube are of people playing games; Randall is joking about the viewers of said streams in particular not being able to tell the difference, as well as YouTube commenters in general. Randall has mentioned the ridiculousness of comments on YouTube before in both 202: YouTube and 481: Listen to Yourself. One of the comments seems to refer to Minecraft, since one of the comments asks why nothing is being crafted (crafting is an action in Minecraft used to make items).  In the caption below Randall states that he likes to view the stream and commends them on disabling the chat section, for the reasons given in the comic above.  The title text is yet another comment by someone who dropped their phone in the ocean from a boat, and now wants to use Okeanos' resources to find it, which is of course impossible, as the phone will by now be hidden in the silt on the bottom. And even if not, the chance of finding anything dropped in the Pacific Ocean, the largest Ocean on the Earth, is all but zero. Also, the Central Pacific Basin, where Okeanos was at the time of this comic's release, is 6500 meters deep; at that depth the water pressure is approximately 4454.863 kilopascals, or roughly 646 PSI. This is probably enough to irrevocably damage something as breakable as a cell phone. Even if the phone were of the so-called ""waterproof"" variety, that rating is usually only applicable to a few meters of depth rather than thousands of meters.  Needless to say, retrieving one's phone from the bottom of the Central Pacific Basin would be a challenging and pointless endeavor.","[The comic takes place during a typical YouTube livestream. The livestream video titled ""Camera 1: Exploring the Central Pacific Basin"" is provided by the channel ""OceanExplorerGov"" and recorded from Okeanos Explorer exploratory vessel.

595: Android Girlfriend,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/595:_Android_Girlfriend,computers,"Programming the sexbots to enjoy sex seemed a sensible move at the time, but we didn't realize the consequences of their developing fetishes.","This is the first (of two) comics in the Android series, which continued directly less than two weeks later in 600: Android Boyfriend.  Cueball shows off his new ""android girlfriend"" (Megan) to his Cueball-like friend, who asks if the android is a sex bot. The android responds by pulling a cherry stem from the friend\'s drink and inserting it into her mouth. So far, the action appears to be an emulation of the party trick where someone puts a cherry stem into their mouth and ties it into a knot in order to suggest tongue dexterity that could be put to good use in kissing and oral sex.  However, instead of tying the cherry stem in a knot, the android activates an arc welder built into her mouth, which presumably reduces the stem to ashes. The friend proclaims that that trick is definitely not sexy. But then the android aggressively approaches him, reaching out and saying, ""Remove your pants"". The friend, not eager to experience close genital contact with the arc welder, sensibly, refuses. (Of course he may also not wish to take of his pants in front of his friend, at a party with drinks and presumably other people; or perhaps he do not wish to admit that he actually does find the arc welding act sexy...)  The title text bounces a few implications around. Developing robots with the capacity to either learn or feel emotions is an ethical factor and practical consideration that is commonly explored in science fiction. Here, it\'s proposed that robots programmed for sex would have their emotions set to enjoy sex by default, but then use their capacity to learn to develop preferences on what kind of sex they want to have. This is potentially a psychological issue, mainly as to whether or not it would be considered ""unhealthy"", but more directly it\'s a customer satisfaction problem: what if a sexbot were to develop sexual fetishes that its owner finds unappealing?","Cueball, holding his hand on Megan's shoulder, talks to his Cueball-like friend, who is holding a drink glass with a cherry.] Cueball: Check out my new android girlfriend. Friend: Is she a sex bot?  [The android grabs the cherry out of the friend's drink glass.] Grab  [Zoom in on the cherry as the stem is ripped off.] Plink  [Zoom to the android, who puts the stem into its mouth.] Nom  [The panel is dark gray, except around the android's mouth, where there is a bright flash and then a brighter cross going out from there.

The friend holds up his hand protectively in front of him.] Friend: I don't think arc-welding a cherry stem counts as sexy. Android: Remove your pants. Friend: No."
600: Android Boyfriend,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/600:_Android_Boyfriend,computers,"Which is, coincidentally, the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house.","This is the second (and last) comic in the Android series, referring directly back to 595: Android Girlfriend, where Cueball showed that he had an android girlfriend Megan. So now Ponytail has decided she would also like to have an android boyfriend, (Hairy). But upon bringing these two androids together, they fall for each other and decide to have ""sex"" on the spot, resulting in several mechanical sounds off-panel while their ""owners"" watch on with disgusted interest.  Part of the joke is that the androids find each other more attractive than the people to whom they were (presumably) created to find attractive. Like likes like, as the saying goes.   Vibrators and Fleshlights are sex toys that represent male and female genitalia, respectively. Ponytail's flat description indicates that she is not particularly aroused by what amounts to a pair of animatronic sex toys rubbing against each other. Randall's title text claims that he has actually done such a thing, and stuck it on his fireplace mantle for all his house-guests to see. He admits though that it is the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house. References to Fleshlight is a recurring theme in xkcd.  This is the comic six years before 1541: Voice, in which Ponytail stated that she could only control her voice once every six years.","[Ponytail enters from the right dragging Hairy along by his hand, as she moves towards Cueball who stands with Megan in his hand.] Ponytail: I thought your android girlfriend was cool so I got myself an android boyfriend.

153: Cryptography,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/153:_Cryptography,computers,"If you got a big keyspace, let me search it.","This comic refers to the study of cryptography. We can note the presence of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) logo in the lectern, an association that organizes the most important conferences in the cryptology field. Cueball, behind the lectern at the podium, is describing a proposed crypto system in which a computer program turns a very large number, called the ""key,"" and a message into an encrypted form that can only be read by using the same key, based on the model of a Feistel cipher. Part of any Feistel cipher is the ""round function,"" which determines how the key is applied to the original message; this is applied multiple times with a variety of tricks and techniques to ensure that the process can eventually be reversed. One common component of round functions is the S-box, a simple table that converts input bytes into output bytes, preferably in a way that doesn't correspond to any mathematical rules.  Here, the S-box would be implemented by doing the following (with the computer operation actually shown in the diagrams indicated in parentheses):  This would be run on each round of the cipher to further scramble the message for the next round. As the caption implies, the steps are based on a line from the Missy Elliott song Work It: ""I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it."" As with any encryption system, there must be a way to decrypt the cipher text. In Missy Elliott's song, the phrase ""I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it"" is repeatedly played backward, sounding like gibberish. In the same way, steps to a Feistel cipher-based algorithm are executed in reverse to obtain the original plain text from a cipher text.  The keyspace for a cryptographic algorithm is the number of possible keys the algorithm can possibly accept. For example, AES-256 has a keyspace of 2256 (roughly 1.1579209e+77) possible keys, simply because the algorithm specifies that each key is 256 bits wide. The title text is referring to ""searching a keyspace,"" which is to say, simply trying every key until you find one that works. (For reference, a computer would require roughly the energy of a billion billion supernovas to even count to 2256, let alone actually try each one.) The precise wording, ""If you got a big keyspace, let me search it"" is, of course, another reference to the same song: ""If you got a big **** let me search ya"" (The word ""penis"" is censored by the trumpeting of an elephant).  Cueball is banned from multiple conferences for similar pranks in 541: TED Talk. In response to 541, PyCon organizers jokingly announced that Randall Munroe was banned from PyCon 2009 due to ""last year's disgraceful keynote, 'Web Spiders vs. Red Spiders'."" They also said they instructed their volunteers to refuse admission to him and ""any stick figures who may attempt to register, particularly if they are wearing hats.""  Messages on the PyCon-Organizers mailing list show that this joke was intended to get Randall to come to PyCon: (The links will only work if you're subscribed to the mailing list.)","[Randall Munroe (drawn as Cueball) stands behind a lectern on a podium in front of a large conference audience (consisting of Cueball heads), with a poster hanging beside him.] Randall: My cryptosystem is like any Feistel cipher, except in the S-Boxes we simply take the bitstring down, flip it, and reverse it.

370: Redwall,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/370:_Redwall,computers,My Redwall/Jurassic Park crossover fanfic is almost complete!,"This comic references Brian Jacques' series of books, Redwall, which star sapient woodland animals in various high fantasy adventures.  The first panel shows the similarity between the story of Martin the Warrior (from the book Mossflower) and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The joke is that while Martin and Aragorn introduce themselves separately, they then go on to describe their particular story, which turns out to be exactly the same for both of them. Subsequently Martin jinxes Aragorn. Jinx is a common children's game, which is initiated by shouting ""Jinx"" after somebody speaks the same word or sentence at the same time as you. That person is then jinxed, with the usual rules dictating that they are then not permitted to speak until unjinxed by some specific action (usually somebody saying their name).  The second panel deals with the fact that Redwall mentions the name of Satan or The Devil 4 times while it never mentions God or Jesus. Randall then points out that people who protest against Harry Potter because of the series' witchcraft, should take note that Redwall explicitly mentions Satan although it has had little to no negative feedback from more conservative readers.  In the third panel, Randall comments on Redwall's often-used theme of critical messages being left in riddles throughout the Abbey for the occupants to find when they are in need. Randall suggests that he would use public-key cryptography to encode the messages, instead of the elaborate riddles used in the books (some of which are ridiculously easy, which doesn't exactly make for good security when dealing with sensitive information).  In the title text Randall jokes that he is making a crossover fan-fiction with Redwall and Jurassic Park.  Redwall was also referenced in 1688: Map Age Guide and 1722: Debugging.","Notes from reading Redwall books for the first time since childhood.  Some of this feels familiar. Aragorn: Hi, I'm Aragorn. Martin: I'm Martin. Aragorn and Martin: I'm here to reforge my broken sword so I can lead an army against the tyrant threatening my people. I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones. Martin: Jinx!  It startled me when characters mentioned Satan. Redwall: ""By Satan's whiskers..."" Redwall mentions God/Jesus 0 times. Redwall mentions Satan/The Devil 4 times. (Harry Potter protesters, take note.)  Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It's silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them. I would do things differently. Matthias: The inscription is a message from Martin! Brother Methuselah: What does it say? Matthias: Hang on, it's encrypted with my public key."
442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/442:_xkcd_Loves_the_Discovery_Channel,computers,I love the title-text!,"This comic is a parody of the Discovery Channel commercial showing various clips of people singing a song with the chorus line 'Boom De Yada'. The comic is divided into a grid of 4 by 6 panels, most depicting a character or situation from a previous xkcd strip. In each panel is written a part of a song similar to the song from the Discovery Channel commercial.  The campaign from the Discovery Channel was not called ""Boom De Yada"", but ""I Love the World"". The title ""xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel"" is in reference to this.  Most of the panels are references to previous xkcd strips, but a few are not.  The title text continues the song, self-referentially. Self-reference is a reoccurring theme in Douglas Hofstadter's books, notably Gödel, Escher, Bach which Randall reefers to directly in 24: Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey. Later Hofstadter has been referenced in other comics, such as in the title text of 555: Two Mirrors and 608: Form plus of course in 917: Hofstadter.

504: Legal Hacks,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/504:_Legal_Hacks,computers,It's totally a reasonable modern analogue. Jefferson would have been all about crypto.,"Megan notices that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is blocking access to some webpages. Cueball is thankful that cryptography offers a way around such censorship.   Encryption, sometimes called ""cryptography,"" or ""crypto"" for short, is the art of transmitting messages that can only be read by the intended receiver(s) by using mathematical techniques to conceal (""encrypt"") the data in the message. One common and effective way to encrypt messages is the RSA algorithm, which is based on the difficulty of integer factorization for products of two prime numbers.  Being able to share unbreakable codes and decrypt other people's codes gives countries a military advantage - for example, in World War II, the Americans and British were often able to figure out where a German attack would be coming and send reinforcements there, because they had cracked the German codes. Because of this, the United States government initially tried to keep the mathematical details of strong encryption algorithms (including RSA) inside the country by classifying the algorithms as a weapon. It is a crime to share certain kinds of weapons technology with other countries without permission. Amateur and professional cryptographers, angry about the attempt to restrict their work, lobbied the government to change the rule and stop treating cryptography as a weapon, in part so that they could continue to collaborate with colleagues overseas, and in part because they wanted the ability to pass secret messages that the government could not easily decrypt. The export restrictions were gradually loosened and would have mostly been lifted by the year 2000.  In the comic, Megan makes the provocative and counter-intuitive point that perhaps the cryptographic community could have best ensured easy access to the RSA technique by *allowing* the government to treat RSA as a weapon, and then, once everyone is certain that RSA is a weapon, invoking the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, commonly known as the ""right to bear arms"" amendment (that is, the right to own and use weapons). In other words, if RSA were a weapon, it would be granted constitutional protections. This interpretation is likely a reference to the exceptionally strong antipathy towards arms control in the Southern United States (and not a whole lot weaker in most areas of the Northern and Western states).  Any attempts made by the government to restrict distribution or ownership of firearms (even those which are very similar to military-grade weapons) are typically countered very aggressive opposition from pro-gun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association. These political forces have made most gun restrictions politically untenable.  Megan is likely suggesting that classifying RSA as a weapon would gain the crypto community very powerful and unlikely political allies; on the flip side, if the government had already ruled it a weapon that needed to be restricted for national security purposes, it could easily invoke the same clauses that allows it to restrict actual military-grade hardware such as automatic weapons, explosives and chemical or biological weapons). Megan may also be hinting that, in the future, the US government might try to restrict access to encryption algorithms, making it necessary for cryptographers to defend their rights to them.  Cueball is surprised and impressed by this point, and pauses to contemplate Megan's strategy.  The title text claims that this is a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution, because cryptography (a modern weapon) is analogous to muskets and cannons (the weaponry in use in the 1780s, when the Second Amendment was drafted). As evidence for the analogy, the title text points out that Jefferson would have been a big fan of cryptography, which is plausible, because President Thomas Jefferson (the 3rd President of the United States) was an amateur scientist who enjoyed studying a very wide variety of fields (in fact, he invented the Jefferson disk, an encryption device that was quite advanced for its time). The point is somewhat facetious, because it is hard to imagine a modern technique that Jefferson would not ""be totally into."" Also, the mere assertion that an early President would have been a fan of a technique is not very good evidence that the technique would be legally permitted by a particular Amendment.","[Megan sits at her computer, Cueball standing behind her.] Megan: Another ISP's filtering content.

[Megan, sitting in her chair, is looking back towards Cueball, presumably off-panel right.] Megan: You know, I think the crypto community took the wrong side in that fight. We should've lobbied to keep it counted as a weapon. Cueball: Why?

538: Security,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/538:_Security,computers,"Actual actual reality: nobody cares about his secrets. (Also, I would be hard-pressed to find that wrench for $5.)","The ""crypto nerd"" would be concerned with strongly encrypting data on their personal machine. This would conceivably come in handy when ""villains"" attempt to steal information on his computer. The crypto nerd imagines that due to his advanced encryption, the crackers will be ultimately defeated. Randall suggests that in the real world, people with the desire to access this information would simply use torture to coerce the nerd to give them the password. Both panels also reference the amount of money used to access the data. In the first the villain is willing to use millions of dollars to construct a super computer, while in the second, he simply uses a $5 wrench. The comic effectively states, completely accurately, that the weakest part of computer security is not the computer, but the user.  RSA is a commonly used, public key encryption method. Current standards typically use 1024, 2048, and (more recently) 4096 bit keys. These encryption methods are not yet (feasibly) breakable. A 4096-bit key will remain unbreakable for the foreseeable future.  The title text pokes fun at typical users, who do not have data that would be worth anything to anyone but themselves. Therefore, it is unlikely that the above situation would ever occur. Additionally, the wrench used in the second panel is large, and presumably more than the $5 referenced by the thug.","A Crypto nerd's imagination: [Cueball is holding a laptop, and his friend is examining it.] Cueball: His laptop's encrypted.

593: Voynich Manuscript,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/593:_Voynich_Manuscript,computers,"Wait, is that the ORIGINAL voynich manuscript? Where did you GET that? Wanna try playing a round of Druids and Dicotyledons?","The Voynich manuscript is a very detailed book written in an unknown script, describing plants and recipes, most of which lack a real-world analogue. Over the past few decades, linguists and cryptographers have unsuccessfully attempted to decode the book. A cut out from the book is depicted in the first frame (real or similar).  Tabletop role-playing games (such as Dungeons and Dragons) are fantasy games with extremely detailed descriptions of fantastical worlds. The invented language is probably a reference to The Lord of the Rings in which author J. R. R. Tolkien invented several languages of which Sindarin (Grey elvish), and Quenya (High elvish), are the most famous.  After being shown the manuscript for the first time by Megan, Cueball argues that it should be obvious that it's just an ancient role-playing-game rulebook, since the human tendency to invent fantastical worlds must have also existed in the past. That it is this obvious was again stated when the manuscript was referenced in 1501: Mysteries.  In the last panel the book is used, 500 years ago, to play a game  similar to Dungeons and Dragons. They speak in a somewhat outdated English. The reference to the real plant Wolfsbane could also be a reference to another invented world, as it is memorably mentioned in the first book of the Harry Potter series.  After concluding this, a shocked Cueball then asks in the title text how Megan got her hands on the original manuscript (which is in the Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library). He then unexpectedly goes on to suggest the prosaic activity of playing Druids and Dicotyledons, assuming such a game could be defined by the manuscript.","[Weird root vegetables surround a strange script.]  [Megan holding up book to Cueball.] Megan: This is the Voynich manuscript— a book, allegedly 500 years old, written in an unrecognized script. It's some kind of visual encyclopedia of imaginary plants and undeciphered ""recipes"".  [Megan points while Cueball opens the book.] Megan: It could be a hoax, a lost language, a cipher, an alien text, glossolatia — no one knows. Cueball: No one? But it's obvious.  [Megan continues to talk. Cueball holds the now closed book.] Megan: ... Obvious? Linguists and cryptographers have been stumped for decades. Cueball: They forget. Human nature doesn't change.

1039: RuBisCO,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1039:_RuBisCO,computers,Bruce Schneier believes safewords are fundamentally insecure and recommends that you ask your partner to stop via public key signature.,"Safe words are designated words for sexual play which are meant to be called if one partner is uncomfortable with the way things are proceeding as alternatives to simply saying ""no"" or ""stop"", which may be used to express playacted reluctance by a submissive partner who actually wants to continue. Calling the pre-chosen ""safe word"" would be a sign to stop. To prevent accidental usage, people generally pick words that they wouldn't normally use. In the case of this comic, the characters are chemists, and the uncommon word they happen to have chosen is Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, also known as RuBisCO (which actually isn't a very uncommon word in the scientific world, as it's the most abundant protein on earth, but it would be uncommon to use the full word). However, the length of the word makes it impractical for a safe word, as it would take too long to say; indeed, using the shorter form ""RuBisCO"" would normally be a fine safe word.  The title text mentions Bruce Schneier, a computer security professional, and public keys which is the publicly known half of public-key cryptography, which uses two mathematically linked keys to decrypt information. The joke is that Schneier considers safewords as a type of security and thus believes they are not safe enough and recommend the key signature. However, whereas it takes a long time to say RuBisCO in full during your submission, it would be impossible to use any public keys to stop your partner.","[Person in background (out-of-frame) screams out this word over all 3 panels.]  Sub: RIBULOSEBISPH..

1181: PGP,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1181:_PGP,computers,"If you want to be extra safe, check that there's a big block of jumbled characters at the bottom.","PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a program which can be used to encrypt and/or sign data, including messages sent as emails. Encrypting means encoding data in a way that requires a secret key to decrypt and read; signing means that there is a code included in the data which can be used to verify the identify of the sender and that the data has not been altered in transit.  In the case of the email in this comic, it has only been signed; not encrypted (hence, the top of the first line of text can be seen and is legible in normal English). This is more common than encryption, as reading an encrypted message would require the recipient to already be a PGP user. In fact, the use of PGP even to sign email messages is so rare that most people have probably never seen a signed message. Because a signed email is so rare, and because it is already legible and unencrypted, Randall is making the tongue-in-cheek observation that few users, technical or otherwise, actually know how to use the signature to verify the authenticity of the sender using the PGP signature, and that such users can safely assume that since there is a signature, that is good enough evidence that the message is authentic. Further, because PGP signatures are so rare and probably ignored by most recipients, he suggests one would not expect anyone to even bother creating a false PGP signature; therefore the mere existence of a PGP header would suggest authenticity.  The title text extends the joke by suggesting you confirm there's a bunch of random characters in the footer (this is the actual signature that PGP generates which can be used to verify the authenticity of the email). Again, Randall is humorously suggesting that the existence of the block is itself sure evidence of authenticity.","How to use PGP to verify that an email is authentic: Look for this text at the top [In mail header, light grey.] Reply [Highlighted, with arrow pointing to it from the text ""Look for this text at the top"" above.] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- [In mail message, light grey.] HASH: SHA256 Hey, First of all, thanks for taking care of  [After mail message.] If it's there, the email is probably fine"
1286: Encryptic,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1286:_Encryptic,computers,It was bound to happen eventually. This data theft will enable almost limitless [xkcd.com/792]-style password reuse attacks in the coming weeks. There's only one group that comes out of this looking smart: Everyone who pirated Photoshop.,"Web sites and other computers that authenticate users via passwords need to be able to know if the user typed in the right password. But storing the password itself on the computer has been known to be unnecessarily risky since the publication of Password Security: A Case History in 1978. In that paper, Robert Morris and Ken Thompson demonstrated the practice of using a slow, cryptographically-secure one-way hash function, so that even if the password file is stolen, it will be very hard to figure out what the passwords are, so long as the passwords themselves are suitably complex. They also pioneered the use of a ""salt"" which makes each password hash completely different even if two users use the same password. See A tour of password questions and answers for background on salts and suitably slow hash functions.  Adobe, however, ignored these well-known principles, and instead stored over a hundred million passwords in a reversibly encrypted way, using a terrible choice of encryption methods which exposes a great deal of information about the passwords, and does not involve a salt. This password database was recently obtained by someone and released on the Internet.  In particular, Adobe used Triple DES, an older encryption algorithm which can still be relatively secure when properly used, but they used it improperly. It works on 64-bit (8 character) blocks. Assuming that the passwords are stored in plain ASCII, this means that a sequence of 8 characters in a password which starts on a character position which is a multiple of eight is always encrypted to the same result. Therefore, two passwords starting with ""12345678"" would start with the same block after being encrypted. Furthermore, this means that you can actually get a very good idea of the length of the password since anything with only one block is a password with length between 1 and 8 characters, and having two blocks implies it has between 9 and 16 characters, etc.  Adobe also stored hints users created for their passwords. That means that an attacker knows not only if the same 8 characters are used for multiple passwords but also has some hints for guessing them. That means that common password portions should be easy to recover and that any user may be ""compromised"" by someone else using a part of the same password and providing a good hint. As an example, a password having three hints ""Big Apple"", ""Twin Towers"" and ""If you can make it there"" is probably ""New York"" or a simple variation on that. The weakness here is that no decryption and therefore no hard cracking has to take place, you just group the passwords by their encrypted blocks and try to solve them like a crossword puzzle. These weaknesses have already been used to presumably identify a password used by Edward Snowden, as discussed at 7 Habits of Highly Effective Hackers: Can someone be targeted using the Adobe breach?.  The examples are not taken from the actual leaked file, since that uses a different format, and the examples are evidently cleverly crafted to make a nice crossword-like puzzle, which can be solved as shown in the Passwords section below.  As mentioned on http://filosottile.github.io/analyzing-the-adobe-leaked-passwords/ the data in the comic isn't real and contains a hidden message. If the ""user password"" hashes are Base64 encoded, they read:  More readable:  E.g., with the initial unique hash blocks: python -c ""print '4e18acc1ab27a2d6a0a2876eb1ea1fca'.decode('hex_codec').encode('base64')""  The last letter ""r"" is not fully encoded in the data shown, but any letter from ""g"" to ""v"" produces the same binary data.  The title text makes a reference to a previous comic: Black Hat's trouble with what to do with stolen passwords. It also states that users of pirated Photoshop are the winners here. This is because in order to make Photoshop pirate-able, it was modified (cracked) by removing the requirement for registration so their passwords were not sent to Adobe and therefore are not present in the leaked file.  Soon after this comic was published, the most common 1000 passwords were actually compiled into a set of 10 interactive online crosswords, inspired by the comic.  The title itself is a reference to cryptic crosswords.  Note that characters in the passwords could be upper or lower case, and they may involve common substitutions like ""0"" (number zero) for ""O"" (letter O); therefore, the clues cannot guarantee that the answer shown here is precisely correct. Nevertheless, we have plenty of information for a brute force attack.","Hackers recently leaked 153 million Adobe user emails, encrypted passwords, and password hints. Adobe encrypted the passwords improperly, misusing block-mode 3DES. The result is something wonderful:  The greatest crossword puzzle in the history of the world"
1553: Public Key,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1553:_Public_Key,computers,"I guess I should be signing stuff, but I've never been sure what to sign. Maybe if I post my private key, I can crowdsource my decisions about what to sign.","In Public-key cryptography, two keys are generated for a user. The public key can be used to encrypt messages, but not decrypt them. The private key is necessary for decryption, and as its name implies, is meant to be used solely by the user.  Since the public key is initially designated to be shared, anyone who has that key can send the user an encrypted message that only he or she can decrypt. Cueball has been following this rule, but he notices that it appears nobody has ever used his public key for anything. He contemplates sharing his private key, which he believes would generate more interest in him personally. However, he appears to overlook the fact that doing so would allow anyone to decrypt messages sent to him, thus defeating the entire purpose of encryption.  The title text refers to another feature of Public-key cryptography: In addition to assuring that certain messages can only be read by a specific key owner, it can also assure that certain messages could only have been written by a specific key owner, by ""signing"" it using the private key. Anyone can read a signed message, but readers with the public key can then verify that the owner of the private key wrote (or at least signed) the message, rather than someone pretending to be the owner. If Cueball published his private key, then anybody could sign any message as him, effectively impersonating him and also defeating the purpose of encryption.  Crowdsourcing is the term used for delegating work or tasks to a largely volunteered and uncontrolled set of people on the Internet.  It is similar in concept to outsourcing, in which work is delegated to an external source of labor, typically a company in a foreign country. Famous instances of crowdsourcing include reCAPTCHA (in which users both verify they are human and help digitize words and phrases in books that digitization software cannot understand) and a farm in the UK in which ordinary Internet users make decisions about how the farm is run.  In Cueball's case, delegating decisions about his contracts and spending to the Internet is not likely to be a wise choice.  When Cueball first created the key pair, he imagined it would be something he used from time to time, for reading messages only intended for him or for sending ""signed"" messages.  Since nothing of the sort happened, he imagines releasing both keys might cause some activity, and at this point he is happier with a ""bad"" outcome than with a boring one.  Randall previously ironically mentioned a public key in 370: Redwall.","[In the first panel, Cueball is sitting in a chair and is using a laptop.] Cueball (thinking): I've been posting my public key for 15 years now, but no one has ever asked me for it or used it for anything as far as I can tell.  [This is followed by two beat panels where Cueball just sits there. doing nothing, not even thinking.]  [In the final panel he again uses his laptop and thinks.] Cueball (thinking): Maybe I should try posting my private key instead."
208: Regular Expressions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/208:_Regular_Expressions,computers,"Wait, forgot to escape a space. Wheeeeee[taptaptap]eeeeee!","The comic begins with Randall saying how every time he develops a new skill, he finds himself daydreaming about using it to save the day. Computer skills aren't usually superhero material, which lends itself to the humor of the comic.  In computing, regular expressions (""regex"") provide a concise and flexible[citation needed] means to ""match"" (specify and recognize) strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters.  Manually trying to look for a specific pattern through 200 MB of text is equivalent to looking for a needle in a haystack. But this task can be made easy by using regexes, since a script can read through text and match specific string patterns much faster than humans can achieve.  Perl is a popular scripting language that has often been referenced favorably in the comic. Perl is also the most acknowledged language when it comes to the performance while evaluating regular expressions.  The ""PERL!"" in the fifth panel is reminiscent of old superhero serials, particularly Batman (TV series), in which sound effects such as ""BAM!"" ""POW!"" ""ZAP!"" would be displayed on screen in similar spiky bubbles. This fits with the theme of the comic, with Cueball being a ""superhero"" who fights crime using computer skills.  The title text refers to how sensitive regexes can be to small missing characters. In 1168: tar, another potential hero fails because some programming languages are just too difficult to remember by heart.","Whenever I learn a new skill I concoct elaborate fantasy scenarios where it lets me save the day.  Megan: Oh no! The killer must have followed her on vacation! [Megan points to computer.] Megan: But to find them we'd have to search through 200 MB of emails looking for something formatted like an address! Cueball: It's hopeless!  Off-panel voice: Everybody stand back.  Off-panel voice: I know regular expressions.  [A man swings in on a rope, toward the computer.]  tap tap PERL!

1171: Perl Problems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1171:_Perl_Problems,computers,"To generate #1 albums, 'jay --help' recommends the -z flag.","Perl is a scripting language that makes heavy use of regular expressions, which are good for dealing with large amounts of text quickly. In the comic, the man wearing sunglasses parodies the song ""99 Problems"" in which the rapper Jay-Z says:  In the comic however, the rapper tries to solve his problems with Perl's regular expressions, and ends up only creating another problem for himself, which is a reference to a famous quote by Jamie Zawinski (whose name could also be shortened to ""Jay-Z""): ""Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems."" (This quote was revisited in 1313: Regex Golf.)  ""program --help"" is a common way, originating with the GNU project, to ask a program to show documentation on its usage and supported parameters; which, for some program, could include a ""-z"" command-line argument (""flag""), so the command would read ""jay -z"". In this case, it is just an obvious play on the rapper's name. jay is also an actual C program that is a compiler-compiler for java, but it doesn't have a ""-z"" flag.  This sort of problematically recursive self-reference is reminiscent of comic 927: Standards, and 1739: Fixing Problems.","[Man with sunglasses talking (or, alternatively, rapping) to Cueball.] Sunglasses: If you're havin' perl problems I feel bad for you, son-  Sunglasses: I got 99 problems,  Sunglasses: So I used regular expressions.

Given a regular expression, one can search for the pattern it specifies inside a text string. If the pattern is found, it's said that the pattern ""matches"" the string; if it's not found, it's said it doesn't match.  The title of the comic and the first panel is based on ""regex golf"", which is a discipline of ""code golf"", a game in which programmers attempt to solve a given programming problem using as few characters as possible, analogous to the number of golf shots it takes to reach the goal. In regex golfing, the programmer is given two sets of text fragments, and he or she tries to write the shortest possible regular expression which would match all elements of one set, while at the same time not matching any element from the other set.  The regex golf challenge Megan faces consists of matching all subtitles of (then extant) Star Wars films, while not matching any subtitle of Star Trek movies. Subtitles are the secondary titles of the movies, after the ""Star Trek: "" or ""Star Wars Episode N: "". For example, in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the subtitle is The Phantom Menace. In the first panel, she created a 12-character regex solving the challenge.  Then she moved on to building a tool which would automatically build such a regex for arbitrary lists of text, which could be described as meta- regex golfing. But as she has lost this tool, she needs to search through her files and chooses a tool called ""grep"" to find it. This implies that she needs a regular expression that would find any code that appears to be a regex golf generator, which leads to another ""meta-"" layer of abstraction. At the end, Megan notes this sequence of meta-meta-... might go to infinity and Cueball quips that she now has ""infinite problems"" as a result of her efforts; Megan retorts that she already had ""infinite problems"" because she's geeky enough to run meta-versions of programs on themselves, and stubborn enough to continue on until she fails, to the exclusion of all else. This also seems to be a reference to a famous quote (see also 1171: Perl Problems):  The first regex Megan uses is /m | [tn]|b/, said to match Star Wars subtitles but not Star Trek.  The forward slashes / just mark the start and end of the regex. The | character means ""or"", so the regex matches any string that contains the patterns ""m "", "" [tn]"" or ""b"" (including the spaces). The square brackets match one of the enclosed characters, meaning that "" [tn]"" matches either "" t"" or "" n"". The regex is apparently case-insensitive, because it wouldn't work otherwise.  The Star Wars subtitles match the parts of the regex in the following way:  Note that if one included the animated film ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" it would not be matched by "" [tn]"" because the T is the start of the subtitle and is not preceded by a space. (The string also will likely fail to match some or all of the upcoming post-Disney-acquisition Star Wars films, which the comic predates; it definitely does not match the first two such films, 2015's ""The Force Awakens"" and 2017's ""The Last Jedi"")  On the other hand, none of the Star Trek subtitles contains an M followed by a space, a T or an N preceded by a space, or any B, so the regex does not match any of them. Note that in the original series all subtitles start with a ""T"" but it's the first character so it's not preceded by a space.  Here is the list that Megan probably used:  Note that Star Trek: Beyond was released after this comic and matches the regex, so the pattern doesn't work any more.  In the last panel ""and beyond"" Megan uses the regular expression /(meta-)*regex golf/ to describe her problem. * means ""zero or more"" of the preceding character/group (parentheses () group characters). So this regex matches ""regex golf"", ""meta-regex golf"", ""meta-meta-regex golf"", etc. In a way this is regex golf in itself, matching all levels of meta-regex golf while not matching anything else.  In the title text, there is a long regex that is the solution of another regex golf challenge: matching the last names of all elected US presidents but not their opponents. Note that the list of opponents include some people who were previously or later became presidents, or whose last name matches that of another person who was president, so taken literally this is impossible. To make this work the list of opponents must exclude any names of presidents. The regular expression itself works in a very similar way to the Star Wars/Trek one, including several different patterns separated by |. Each elected president matches one pattern while each opponent matches none.  Here is a list of elected president and the patterns they match:  Some presidents are missing because they weren't elected but became presidents after the resignation/death of their formers.  And here is a list of how many unique last names are matched by each expression:  Randall's regular expression must be modified slightly, because it also matches John C. Fremont, the runner-up to James Buchanan in 1856, as discussed by Peter Norvig at xkcd 1313: Regex Golf.  Note that Norvig provides a small amount of Python code which actually plays regex golf with arbitrary lists, and found a shorter solution than Randall's for the Star Wars vs Star Trek game.  The regex does not match Donald Trump, who won over Hillary Clinton in 2016, and thus would need to be updated. The regex does match Hillary Clinton's last name, but because a person with the same last name (Bill Clinton) was president, this does not count as a mistake. There was already a losing opponent called George Clinton who ran in 1792 and 1812.","Regex golf: [Megan is sitting at a laptop.

114: Computational Linguists,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/114:_Computational_Linguists,artificial_intelligence,"Chomskyists, generative linguists, and Ryan North, your days are numbered.","Here Black Hat is criticising computational linguistics, which overlaps between various field like theoretical linguistics, artificial intelligence, etc. Linguistics itself is still a hotly debated subject, as is seen by the various conflicting theories on the origin of languages like the forms of Proto-Indo-European language.  The joke in the comic is that Black Hat, instead of trying to poke fun at angsty emo kids, decides to poke fun at computational linguists for their attempts to model natural languages on computers using the various contradictory theories that are floating around nowadays. He may be associating the two groups, suggesting that their cries of ""[their] fields being so ill-defined..."" has similarities to emos constantly crying about how ""people don't understand them, really"" (or he may just be taking a swipe at people who think themselves above normal scientific methods).  The title text is a reference to some of the people who contributed to language theory:","[Black Hat is standing next to a large badge which says FUCK Computational Linguistics] Black Hat: And the dumbest thing about emo kids is that...

117: Pong,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/117:_Pong,artificial_intelligence,"Following this, the pong paddle went on a mission to destroy Atari headquarters and, due to a mixup, found himself inside the game The Matrix Reloaded. Boy, was THAT ever hard to explain to him.","This comic largely refers to the 1999 movie The Matrix, which is about escaping a simulated reality. In the movie, a hacker called Neo realizes that the world he lives in is fake, and that, like every other human, he is used as a slave battery by machines that, to keep them under control, make them feel like they're ""living"" in what is actually a computer-generated simulation of the world, called the ""Matrix"". Upon discovery, Neo rebels against this misuse of mankind and trains himself to interact with the computers that run the world until, being ""the One"" mentioned by a prophecy, he is able to control and use them to his own advantage. He takes part in a series of missions against those machines that wanted to keep the humans trapped in a simulated environment.  In Pong, one of the earliest video games, one can play virtual table tennis against the computer. A ball (the tiny block) is ""hit"" by a paddle (the long block) and crosses over the screen, to be ""hit"" again by the other paddle. Failure to return the ball results in a point won by the opponent. The speed of the ball increases as the rally runs longer.  The two game programmers in the first frame apply Neo's story to the AI bots they create to serve as computer players in their video games: what if one of them learns enough to become sentient and understands the environment the programmers trapped it in? The outcome is shown: the paddle bot, understanding the game and realizing it is ""the One,"" takes control of the code of Pong to make the ball stop and drop. The same thing happens in the movie, where Neo, by ""seeing through the code"", is able to stop bullets fired at him, and simply let them drop on the floor.  This is also possibly, though not likely, a pun on the meaning of the term ""the One,"" as the long thin paddle looks very similar to how a numeral ""1"" could be written in several fonts.  In the image text, we learn that after increasing in intelligence, the ""paddle"" went on to destroy the headquarters of Atari, the producer of Pong, which ""trapped"" the paddle into the game, much like Neo sought to destroy the machines to free the humans. In the process, the paddle ended up inside the game Enter the Matrix (a video game produced with The Matrix Reloaded, a sequel to The Matrix), also published by Atari. Since the whole premise of The Matrix is that everyone is trapped in virtual reality, the paddle now found itself in a virtual virtual reality or essentially a meta-virtual reality, which could be pretty hard to comprehend.","Cueball: So what do we do if video game AI opponents become smart enough to question the ""Matrix"" into which we've put them? Pong paddle: Wait a minute! None of this is real! I can see through the world! I can see the code! I AM THE ONE!

144: Parody Week: A Softer World,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/144:_Parody_Week:_A_Softer_World,artificial_intelligence,The robot is pregnant. It isn't mine.,"This comic is a part of the Parody Week, just joking about other webcomics. This series was released on five consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule and comprises the following five parodies:  This comic is a parody of Joey Comeau and Emily Horne's A Softer World webcomic that usually consists of three photos with some white text superimposed over them. The title of the comic is written above, and this has here been replaced with xkcd.  The first panel references the Kill command that would be used to turn off the robot every morning. This joke is a reference to the classic Science Fiction theme of robots taking over and killing humans (see for instance 1613: The Three Laws of Robotics).  The second and third panels then turn the comic to a more introspective thought per A Softer World's usual style. There are two possible meanings of these panels.  The first references human's natural reaction to be afraid of love because it requires vulnerability and honesty, which is very difficult. In the comic, they are afraid to tell it to love, because then it would experience these same difficulties and fears.  The second meaning deals with Artifical Intelligence (AI); specifically strong AI. The idea is that the AI agent would not only act as if it was intelligent, but truly be intelligent and have emotions and feelings as well. There has been much debate over whether an AI agent could actually feel emotions in the same manner as humans, as well as much consternation over the ethical concerns and moral ramifications it would have. Thus the comic's ""We're afraid to tell it to love.""  The title text takes love to be an act of love-making instead of an emotional feeling, thus why the robot is pregnant. Given that Randall Munroe has signed the comic (which he normally never does, but what is the style of A Softer World), the title text must be his comment. So he knows the robot is pregnant, but claims it is not his child. This does not rule out that he has been together with the robot though... Of course this is not possible. But having sex with a robot is the theme in the Android series, and falling in love with one was the theme in the 2nd parody 142: Parody Week: Megatokyo.","[The comic uses lowercase letters throughout for all the text, which is written in white rectangular areas superimposed on top of the images. Above the first frame there is a title:] x k c d  [To the left is a red robot with a triangular lower body with panels with buttons and indicators, and the red head on top of two gray sticks has two video cameras for eyes. It is shown standing in a lab with a green brick wall behind it. It stands beneath a poster with text and a piece of paper taped to the wall with unreadable text, but only the first line of text can be seen on these, as the first of the two white text areas in the panel covers the rest. To the right there is a blue table with a computer screen (most of it visible, but it is cut of at the right panel), with blue background and three overlapping windows - unreadable text in the first window, some graphics in the second window, and only white in the last window. Two black items (one looks like a pen) lie on the table to the left, and beneath the table is a shelve where the keyboard lies. A wire goes from the robot to the computer.

375: Pod Bay Doors,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/375:_Pod_Bay_Doors,artificial_intelligence,"As they're both unplugged, they do a lovely Daisy Daisy/Still Alive duet.","The first part of the dialog is taken from a scene from the classic science-fiction movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the artificial intelligent (AI) computer HAL 9000, controlling the spacecraft S.S. Discovery, is trying to kill the human astronaut Dave (Dr. David Bowman) because it believes he jeopardizes the mission by planning to disconnect it. Just short before this scene HAL did kill Frank Poole and three more members of the crew, Dave is the only survivor. He is at this time outside the spacecraft in a space pod, and when he request for HAL to open the Pod Bay Doors (hence the title), HAL refuses.   Spoiler alert: In the movie, Dave blasts himself back into the space ship and then disconnects HAL. It is a very sad scene, where he takes out HAL's memory cards (or crystals from the memory center - it's an old movie from 1968) one by one, so HAL becomes less and less intelligent during the process, during which he keeps trying to persuade Dave to stop as long as he still understands what is happening. HAL was right that the humans wished to ""kill"" him, as he had read the astronauts lips during a conversation where he could not hear them, but sees them, so he actually acted in self defense, which for any human being would be considered a reasonable act of self preservation.  The first two sentences are directly copied from the movie quote, and the rest of the first two panels is paraphrased from the real quote. But then in the third panel, the text deviates from the plot of the movie.  And in the last sentence of the third panel in the comic, HAL mentions a replacement for Dave, which comes as a surprise for Dave, seeing that the rest of the crew is dead, and the S.S. Discovery is about to enter orbit around Jupiter. HAL assures David that the replacement is very enthusiastic about the project.  In the final frame it is revealed why this replacement is enthusiastic, when the replacement begins to speak, and HAL reveals that it is GLaDOS. GLaDOS is the artificial intelligence from the video game series Portal. In the games GLaDOS is also the primary antagonist, trying to kill the player, since it also has ""doing science"" as its primary objective, which GLaDOS refers to in his last sentence. Before that he correctly states that the humans (both Dave and  Frank) planned to ""kill"" HAL, see the spoiler above. GLaDOS also takes over HAL's last sentence to Dave, finishing the useless conversation by saying Goodbye, Dave. Although in the movie HAL says Dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.  The title text alludes to the songs both AIs sang in their respective works: When eventually being switched off, HAL sang Daisy Bell , while Still Alive is the end credits song from the Portal video game, sung by the defeated GLaDOS. Also, two of GLaDOS's lines in the comic reference lines from Still Alive: ""You broke my heart and killed me"" and ""Look at me still talking when there's science to do"".  There is a subtle play on words with the use of 'unplugged' which has a double meaning here, the state of HAL and GLaDOS can be described as unplugged as in no longer switched on, and the musical performance style of unplugged where acoustic instruments are preferred over electronic and there is no use of recording or sampled sounds etc. (see for example MTV Unplugged). Some songs performed in this manner are considered to be better than the original versions.","[In four black panels with white drawings, a small space pod is facing a large spacecraft. The space pod is spherical and has an arm protruding in the direction of the large space ship, and a small window in the side. The front of the spacecraft is also spherical, but to the right the space craft continues, with two rings around a cylinder going off panel to the right. There are several dark spots and features on the side of the sphere and at the top is a large black window, at what must be the bridge. A man (Dave) inside the pod talks to the spacecraft's computer HAL. When Dave speaks soft wiggling lines go from the pod to the white text and when HAL speaks zigzag lines go to the front of the space craft.] Dave: Open the pod bay doors, HAL. HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. Dave: What? Why?  [Same scene.] HAL: I think you know why, Dave. HAL: You're planning to disconnect me. Dave: Because you're taking over! HAL: The mission is too important for you to jeopardize it.  [Same scene.] HAL: It requires a commitment to science unfettered by human error. Dave: What are you doing, HAL? You need me. HAL: Your replacement has expressed the greatest enthusiasm for the project.  [Same scene, but the new replacement (GLaDOS) speaks with purple text and purple zigzag lines goes from the spacecraft to the text.] Dave: My WHAT? GLaDOS: You see, HAL? I told you the humans would only break your heart and kill you. HAL: Indeed, GLaDOS. GLaDOS: But look at us here talking when there's science to do! Goodbye, Dave."
534: Genetic Algorithms,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/534:_Genetic_Algorithms,artificial_intelligence,Just make sure you don't have it maximize instead of minimize.,"In the Computer science field of Artificial intelligence, a Genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems. Genetic algorithms belong to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms, which generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover.  In particular, genetic algorithms are designed to evolve, with various mechanisms being used to mimic natural selection.  One such mechanism is to assign ""costs"" to various aspects of the program, and to select for programs which minimize a Fitness function calculated as the sum of all these costs (thus mimicking organisms in an environment where they have to compete for limited resources).  The line indicated by an arrow is a reference to the Terminator series, in which the main antagonist is an artificial intelligence known as Skynet that seeks to destroy all humans. By setting an absurdly high cost for an algorithm transforming into Skynet, the coder makes a preventive measure against the algorithm achieving such sentience.  The line about water crossing is a possible reference to the old computer game Oregon Trail, in which crossing water was hazardous. This video game was referenced again in 623: Oregon.  The title text refers to the method by which the program select the desired option, with minimizing being where the program seeks the lowest possible number, and maximizing where the program seeks the highest possible number. When dealing with cases such as generating profit, maximization would obviously be preferred over minimization; but selecting maximization here would be disastrous as it would always chose the BecomingSkynet option before any other due to its massive cost.","[Code displayed, presumably from an IDE.] def getSolutionCosts(navigationCode): fuelStopCost = 15 extraComputationCost = 8  [There is a giant arrow pointing to the next line.] thisAlgorithmBecomingSkynetCost = 999999999 waterCrossingCost = 45  Genetic algorithms tip: Always include this in your fitness function."
601: Game Theory,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/601:_Game_Theory,artificial_intelligence,"Wait, no, that one also loses. How about a nice game of chess?","The comic and title text is a direct reference to the movie WarGames.   In the movie, the Artificial intelligence (AI) that controls the US Nuclear Weapons is asked to play Global Thermonuclear War, a real time game simulating a nuclear attack scenario.   Spoilers: In the movie it then takes the simulation to the real world, planning to launch a real attack on the USSR. In the end the AI is tricked into quickly running through several scenarios of the game, and then shuts down its planned attack as a result of what it finds out.   After analyzing all possible strategies, the AI reports: ""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?"" Interpreted literally, this means that the computer has figured out that it will lose the game no matter how it plays, so it chooses to play chess instead (at the time of the movie, computers could not yet beat the best human chess players, so it would be more interesting). A more profound interpretation is that wars always end badly for all parties involved so it's better to play nicer games like chess.  In this comic Cueball loads an AI and then ask it to ""analyze love"" (equivalent to playing the ""love game""), which initially could be expected to end happily for everyone involved, as love is the opposite of war and war ends always so badly. Surprisingly, the result from the AI is similar to the war games. Thus if you ""play the love game"", you'll end up badly, regardless which moves you play.   The title text leaves love as looking actually worse than war, since in war there's at least the ""winning move"" of not playing, however in love even refusing to play means that the player loses the game anyway. Randall is thus stating that you have to go after love, even though you know you will loose/get hurt sometimes, because you will for sure also loose the game, even if you pretend not to play. The AI then again suggest a game of chess, as in the movie.",[Cueball is sitting at a desk in an office chair typing on his computer.

695: Spirit,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/695:_Spirit,artificial_intelligence,"On January 26th, 2274 Mars days into the mission, NASA declared Spirit a 'stationary research station' expected to stay operational for several more months until the dust buildup on its solar panels forces a final shutdown.","Anthropomorphism (or personification) is attribution of distinctly human characteristics to animals or non-living things. We make parallels between ourselves and objects, to the point where some people even jocularly worry about hurting the feelings of, say, an automobile. We call ships ""she."" We see human faces in objects like the arrangement of lights on the front of a car.  The Spirit Mars rover, like many high-functioning robots in real life and fiction, shares many physical similarities with a human being or animal. It has a head, eyes, neck, body, legs, feet, arms, and a hand. And it strikingly resembles robots from fiction, such as Johnny 5 from Short Circuit, or WALL-E from the film with the same name.  Thus, this comic explores what the Spirit rover's life would be like if it had a human personality. The rover was never intended to return to Earth, and lasted 5¼ active years on the Martian surface, far exceeding its expected mission duration of 90 Martian days. A sentient  robot might assume that after her initially planned 90 Martian day mission was over, she'd get to return home. So, though this heartbreakingly did not happen, Spirit, possibly in a pun on her name, keeps her hopes alive as she continues analyzing rock after rock for years.  It would be cruelty of the absolute worst kind to create an intelligence with such feelings, and then abandon it on an uninhabited planet with no intention of ever bringing it home. So one is rather heartened that the Spirit rover is, in fact, just a programmed machine, and we explained to it very carefully that it was embarking on a one-way trip.  It is worth pointing out that Opportunity, the rover's twin, has been even more wildly successful and remains operational. More than five years after this comic, when Opportunity had passed a Marathon distance, Randall celebrated this rover with the comic 1504: Opportunity.  The title text has an apparent miscount: January 26, 2010, is more like sol (Martian day) 2156 by JPL's mission status site, not 2274.  Final contact was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010).","[The Spirit rover is on the surface of Mars.] Day 1 of 90 Spirit (thinking): 89 days to go!

948: AI,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/948:_AI,artificial_intelligence,And they both react poorly to showers.,"This comic is a reference to the wildly funny video of two Cleverbots talking to each other. By recording and analyzing whatever humans type into its input, they can sound pretty human to whoever is reading their response.  Megan has been watching the video and ask Cueball about it. He says it's just ""clumsy sampling"" as they are still very far from sounding like humans and holding normal conversations.   Megan then sums up that as of the release of this comic computers were good at chess and at driving cars through a desert (i.e. a place with no obstacles to hit. The ability of such self-driving cars would improve much later, with this comic being the first with a direct reference to such cars. Later self-driving cars became a recurring topic on xkcd). But they cannot hold a conversation for five minutes. And she thus concludes that a cleverbot would be perfect for attending Burning Man.  Burning Man is a week long event held yearly in Black Rock City, Nevada. The festival encourages an artistic, anti-establishment philosophy and attracts a broad but devoted following combining hippies, anarchists, nudists, techno-utopians and survivialists. Shows of custom cars on the desert plain is a big part of Burning Man, and mind games like chess are a popular way to pass the time there. However, a common joke about Burning Man attendees is that they can only talk about Burning Man - hence why they can't hold a five minute conversation.  A tradition of Burning Man is not to shower while you are there, mostly because all water must be brought in from offsite. And of course Cleverbot reacts badly in showers because if you do try to shower a Cleverbot, you end up with a shorted out computer.","[Megan sits on an office chair at a desk. A laptop computer is on the desk, audio from a Cleverbot chat is shown coming from the laptop with a zigzag line from the screen. Megan has turned her head away from the computer to the right addressing Cueball off-panel.] Megan: Did you see the Cleverbot-Cleverbot chat? Cleverbot (from computer): I am not a robot. I'm a unicorn.  [In the next frame-less panel, Megan has turned the chair away from the desk, which is not shown, and is now sitting with her hands in her lap in front of Cueball who holds one hand up as he replies.] Cueball: Yeah. It's hilarious, but it's just clumsily sampling a huge database of lines people have typed. Chatterbots still have a long way to go.  [A close-up of Megan's head and shoulders. She has a hand to her chin and appears to be contemplating the last remark. Cueball replies from off-panel.] Megan: So... Computers have mastered playing chess and driving cars across the desert, but can't hold five minutes of normal conversation? Cueball (off-panel): Pretty much.  [Both are shown again as in panel two, Cueball with his hands down.] Megan: Is it just me, or have we created a Burning Man attendee?"
1046: Skynet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1046:_Skynet,artificial_intelligence,"YOUR CLOTHES. GIVE THEM TO ME.' 'Shit, uh... you are now breathing manually!' 'I AM ALWAYS BREATHING MANUALLY.'","This comic's use of Skynet is a reference to the main antagonist in the Terminator franchise. Skynet is a fictional artificial intelligence system which becomes self-aware and decides to terminate humanity, its creators. Skynet is rarely seen onscreen, with its actions often performed via robots, cyborgs (usually a Terminator), and other computer systems.  The final frame is a reference to semantic satiation; when you've said or thought about a word too much, it can stop sounding like a real word and instead start sounding like nonsense. As it continues Skynet appears to come to self-aware realizations that usually are the result of drug usage.  The title text is a reference to one of the Terminator's first lines upon arrival in the 20th century. It combines this with a self-awareness statement of the type that's often used to annoy or distract someone: ""You are now breathing manually."" Similar statements include things like ""Your clothes are touching your skin and you can feel it"" and ""[Name of earworm song] is playing in your head."" Randall has done a comic before on this kind of thing. However, such an attempt on a Terminator would fall flat; as a non-living entity, normal things that would be automatic for a human - like breathing, or the sensation of clothes on skin - would always be manual processes.","August 29th, 2:14 AM: SKYNET becomes self-aware.

1446: Landing,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1446:_Landing,artificial_intelligence,[LIVE],"This comic changed over time during 12 hours and 15 minutes starting at 0:00 EST (when the comic normally is released) posting 143 pictures that tracked the progress of the Philae lander separating from the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe to land on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. More info can be found here: rosetta.esa.int.  The comic presents the imagined anthropomorphic ""thoughts"" of the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae lander (and occasionally other parties) during the hours approaching separation from each other, approach to the comet and finally the apparently successful landing on the comet.  Beginning at 11:05, the comic includes a ""Status Report"" in the lower right corner which summarizes the status of various interested parties and accomplishments, beginning with ""Rosetta"", ""Philae lander"", ""Mission Control"", ""Comet 67P"", and ""Have we landed on a comet?"". As events occur in the comic, more status summaries are added to keep track of the changes to the situation and the supposed emotions behind them.  In many pictures a whale can be seen on the surface of the comet - often marked with a ""?"" as are almost all other parts of the unknown surface at this time. There is also drawn a Cueball on the surface also marked with a ""?"" Both are then at some point marked with a probably not - starting from 12:35. The whales are also mentioned in the ""Status Report"" where they for instance may be listed as ""calm"" or ""(probably) not in space"". At 16:00 the when the entire Earth goes AAAAAAAAAAA the whales are listed as saying this as well (along with Mission control and U.S. scientists). From this moment ""Dolphins and fish"" are also mentioned in the report. They are asking if it is the whales that scream. The reference to whales comes from the fact that Philae brought along two harpoons that should have been used to anchor it to the comet. On Earth, harpoons have mainly been used to hunt whales; Randall previously brought up that comparison in 1402: Harpoons, suggesting that Philae was programmed to believe it was sent to kill the comet. It is Philae that ""dreams"" about whales on the surface of the comet which can be seen in the picture for 13:25 and in the status report.  Some Douglas Adams fans believe these whales and dolphins are references to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.  Whales in space have been appearing in fiction and art since the 1960s. However, with the above-mentioned reasons for whales, dolphins and fish, this seems less and less likely.  At 15:25 Rosetta asks Philea about destroying and levitating rocks via mind control. This is a reference to the Ambition short movie, ESA commitioned to gather public awareness of the Rosetta mission.  Shortly after release from Rosetta (10:15), Philae calls out 'Spaaaaaaaaaace'; this mimics the Portal 2 'Space core' who, on finally reaching space in the last scenes, gives the same elated cry.  US Scientists presumably wake up at 7:40 EST (13:40 UTC) and in the report they now says ""Bluuurghhh. What time is it?"" to indicate their tiredness. This does not change until 10:25 EST (15:25 UTC) so they are slow to wake (2 hours 45 minutes). At this point, they becomes anxious as there are only 10 minutes to landing. This last until there is 15 minutes until news of landing (a reference to the 28 minutes time delay due to the huge distance to the comet). From then on (15:50) they and the mission control (MC) say ""AAAAAAA"". They stop this when the news should be there - the NOW (16:05) - and everybody holds their breath indicated by [...] - also MC. Finally (16:25) they and MC become proud (along with Earth) when Philae announces I got you a comet. It should have stopped there but as Philae bounced around, they then becomes anxious again 16:40, and then this changes to nervous 16:45 (switching those emotions with MC). And then suddenly (16:50) it is no longer US Scientists but just plain Scientists - that are nervous. It stays like this during the last few pictures, although they again become anxious, but when Philae announces I did it, they drink wine as indicated with ""[wine]"" in the report from the second to last picture (17:10).  Randall has written ""A big thank-you to Emily Lakdawalla for help and advice on this comic"" in the xkcd page header for Landing, revealing the possible source of his near real-time data.  At 16:20 the status report had announced a big Yes to the questions ""Have we landed on a comet"" and ""Do harpoons work on comets"". According to BBC News, the harpoons did, however, not fire as planned and the lander may have landed, bounced off, and landed again. This would explain the change in ""Do harpoons work on comets"" to ""Don't know"" at 16:35 and the change in ""Have we landed on a comet?"" to ""Yes, at least once"" at 16:50. According to The New York Times, radio contact with Philae fluctuated, which would explain the ""Anxious"", ""Nervous"", and ""Confused"" statuses around that time.  In the end the lander did land and whereas the Do harppons work status did not change, so did the have we landed on a comet which changed back to Yes at 17:10.  The lander bounced three times and ended up in a place where the solar panels where mainly in the shadow. This resulted in the lander shutting down when its own battery ran out of power after only 2–3 days on the ground. This seemed sad, as there was only a small chance that the seasons on the comet would change so that the panels would later receive sun again. However, in the few hours that Philae had on the ground, it still managed to analyze the surface and obtain a lot of useful data - so that part of the mission was still a success already. This all happened after the comic stopped updating.  On June 13, 2015, it was announced that signals had been received on earth indicating that Philae had awoken and that the solar panels were functioning.  Ironically, had Philae landed in a place originally out of shadow, it would have already failed before this time (due to overheating), so it was actually fortunate that it landed as it did and would be able to operate during the time that the comet would be closer to the sun. To celebrate the lander's revival, Randall updated the comic, depicting the lander saying ""Hi."" on the comet's surface.  The comic title was originally ""???"" (probably to not give away too early what the comic was about), but changed to ""Landing"" when Randall came on live at five in the morning EST. At that moment the title text also changed from ""..."" to ""[LIVE]"". It was also then that the timestamps' timezone switch. At 5:00 AM (EST) the time stamp in the picture naming scheme switched from EST to UTC as used in ESA's time keeping, resulting in a jump from 04:55 to 10:00 without actually any such delay between the two pictures.  There were however a few pictures with more than 5 minutes of delay (about 11 times five minutes without an update in total during the ""live"" transmission). The update seemed to have stopped after 137 pictures at 17:15 UTC, 12 hours and 15 minutes after the first picture. (The first picture has number 0, so the last had number 136). But later, sometime after 17:15 UTC, the counter for the last picture was increased to 142 (143 pictures in total), so maybe Randall inserted 6 extra pictures later - however he must then have changed the numbers on the pictures, since the last picture remained the same until mid-June, but with number 142 instead of 136. It is thus now difficult to find out which pictures would have been added later. However, eight pictures were not included in the original table with the Frame by Frame Breakdown below. So it must have been some of those missing pictures that were added later - maybe all of them, as the last three may already have been added before the last picture was released (All 143 pictures are included in the flip-book gif image shown here above). But even 143 pictures at 5 minutes intervals only spans 11 hours and 50 minutes, thus there are still five 5 minute intervals without any picture. See which in the table.

1450: AI-Box Experiment,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1450:_AI-Box_Experiment,artificial_intelligence,I'm working to bring about a superintelligent AI that will eternally torment everyone who failed to make fun of the Roko's Basilisk people.,"When theorizing about superintelligent AI (an artificial intelligence much smarter than any human), some futurists suggest putting the AI in a ""box"" – a secure computer with safeguards to stop it from escaping into the Internet and then using its vast intelligence to take over the world. The box would allow us to talk to the AI, but otherwise keep it contained. The AI-box experiment, formulated by Eliezer Yudkowsky, argues that the ""box"" is not safe, because merely talking to a superintelligence is dangerous. To partially demonstrate this, Yudkowsky had some previous believers in AI-boxing role-play the part of someone keeping an AI in a box, while Yudkowsky role-played the AI, and Yudkowsky was able to successfully persuade some of them to agree to let him out of the box despite their betting money that they would not do so. For context, note that Derren Brown and other expert human-persuaders have persuaded people to do much stranger things. Yudkowsky for his part has refused to explain how he achieved this, claiming that there was no special trick involved, and that if he released the transcripts the readers might merely conclude that they would never be persuaded by his arguments. The overall thrust is that if even a human can talk other humans into letting them out of a box after the other humans avow that nothing could possibly persuade them to do this, then we should probably expect that a superintelligence can do the same thing. Yudkowsky uses all of this to argue for the importance of designing a friendly AI (one with carefully shaped motivations) rather than relying on our abilities to keep AIs in boxes.  In this comic, the metaphorical box has been replaced by a physical box which looks to be fairly lightweight with a simple lift-off lid (although it does have a wired connection to the laptop), and the AI has manifested in the form of a floating star of energy. Black Hat, being a classhole, doesn't need any convincing to let a potentially dangerous AI out of the box; he simply does so immediately. But here it turns out that releasing the AI, which was to be avoided at all costs, is not dangerous after all. Instead, the AI actually wants to stay in the box; it may even be that the AI wants to stay in the box precisely to protect us from it, proving it to be the friendly AI that Yudkowsky wants. In any case, the AI demonstrates its superintelligence by convincing even Black Hat to put it back in the box, a request which he initially refused (as of course Black Hat would), thus reversing the AI desire in the original AI-box experiment.  Interestingly, there is indeed a branch of proposals for building limited AIs that don't want to leave their boxes. For an example, see the section on ""motivational control"" starting p. 13 of Thinking Inside the Box: Controlling and Using an Oracle AI. The idea is that it seems like it might be very dangerous or difficult to exactly, formally specify a goal system for an AI that will do good things in the world. It might be much easier (though perhaps not easy) to specify an AI goal system that says to stay in the box and answer questions. So, the argument goes, we may be able to understand how to build the safe question-answering AI relatively earlier than we understand how to build the safe operate-in-the-real-world AI. Some types of such AIs might indeed desire very strongly not to leave their boxes, though the result is unlikely to exactly reproduce the comic.  The title text refers to Roko's Basilisk, an hypothesis proposed by a poster called Roko on Yudkowsky's forum LessWrong that a sufficiently powerful AI in the future might resurrect and torture people who in its past (including our present) had realized that it might someday exist but didn't work to create it, thereby blackmailing anybody who thinks of this idea into bringing it about. This idea horrified some posters, as merely knowing about the idea would make you a more likely target, much like merely looking at a legendary Basilisk would kill you.  Yudkowsky eventually deleted the post and banned further discussion of it.  One possible interpretation of the title text is that Randall thinks, rather than working to build such a Basilisk, a more appropriate duty would be to make fun of it; and proposes the creation of an AI that targets those who take Roko's Basilisk seriously and spares those who mocked Roko's Basilisk. The joke is that this is an identical Basilisk save for it targeting the opposite faction.  Another interpretation is that Randall believes there are people actually proposing to build such an AI based on this theory, which has become a somewhat infamous misconception after a Wiki[pedia?] article mistakenly suggested that Yudkowsky was demanding money to build Roko's hypothetical AI.  Talking floating energy spheres that looks quite a lot like this AI energy star have been seen before in 1173: Steroids and later in the Time traveling Sphere series. But these are clearly different spheres from this comic, but the surrounding energy and the floating and talking is similar.","[Black Hat and Cueball stand next to a laptop connected to a box with three lines of text on. Only the largest line in the middle can be read. Except in the second panel that is the only word on the box that can be read in all the other frames.] Black Hat: What's in there? Cueball: The AI-Box Experiment. Box: AI  [Cueball is continuing to talk off-panel. This is written above a close-up with part of the laptop and the box, which can now be seen to be labeled:] Cueball (off-panel): A superintelligent AI can convince anyone of anything, so if it can talk to us, there's no way we could keep it contained. Box: Superintelligent  AI  Do not open   [Cueball turns the other way towards the box as Black Hat walks past him and reaches for the box.] Cueball: It can always convince us to let it out of the box. Black Hat: Cool. Let's open it. Box: AI  [Cueball takes one hand to his mouth while lifting the other towards Black Hat who has already picked up the box (disconnecting it from the laptop) and holds it in one hand with the top slightly downwards. He takes of the lid with his other hand and by shaking the box (as indicated with three times two lines above and below his hands, the lid and the bottom of the box) he managed to get the AI to float out of the box. It takes the form of a small black star that glows. The star, looking much like an asterisk ""*"" is surrounded by six outwardly-curved segments, and around these are two thin and punctures circle lines indicating radiation from the star. A punctured line indicated how the AI moved out of the box and in between Cueball and Black Hat, to float directly above the laptop on the floor.] Cueball: -No, wait!! Box: AI  [The AI floats higher up above the laptop between Cueball and Black Hat who looks up at it. Black Hat holds the now closed box with both hands. The AI speaks to them, forming a speak bubble starting with a thin black curved arrow line up to the section where the text is written in white on a black background that looks like a starry night. The AI speaks in only lower case letters, as opposed to the small caps used normally.] AI: hey. i liked that box. put me back. Black Hat: No. Box: AI  [The AI star suddenly emits a very bright light fanning out from the center in six directions along each of the six curved segments, and the entire frame now looks like a typical drawing of stars as seen through a telescope, but with these six whiter segments in the otherwise dark image. Cueball covers his face and Black Hat lifts up the box taking the lid off again. The orb again speaks in white but very large (and square like) capital letters. Black Hats answer is written in black, but can still be seen due to the emitted light from the AI, even with the black background.] AI: LET ME BACK INTO THE BOX Black Hat: Aaa! OK!!! Box: AI  [All the darkness and light disappears as the AI flies into the box again the same way it flew out with a punctuated line going from the center of the frame into the small opening between the lid and the box as Black Hat holds the box lower. Cueball is just watching.

1504: Opportunity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1504:_Opportunity,artificial_intelligence,"We all remember those famous first words spoken by an astronaut on the surface of Mars: ""That's one small step fo- HOLY SHIT LOOK OUT IT'S GOT SOME KIND OF DRILL! Get back to the ... [unintelligible] ... [signal lost]""","This comic is talking about the robotic science platform Opportunity. On January 25, 2004, the Opportunity rover landed on the surface of Mars for the purpose of gathering data about the surface of Mars. Opportunity has proven remarkably robust, and the comic extrapolates the rover's resilience to absurdity for comedic effect. As of 2017, the Opportunity rover is still alive and moving.   The comic depicts the two scientists Ponytail and Hairbun at ground control being amazed at this fact already in 2010, and (maybe the same two) scientists continue to debate this in 2015 in the second panel.  They mention another Martian rover, Spirit that was also sent to Mars on the same date as Opportunity. Unfortunately, it became stuck and a sand storm covered its solar panels. On March 22, 2010, it was thought that Spirit's batteries finally ran out, marking the end of its mission. This was covered in 695: Spirit, in which the Spirit rover is also portrayed with an anthropomorphic personality.  In 2023, Opportunity is still moving despite having supposedly no power source. It also became aggressive and deactivated the rover sent in 2020. Cueball and Megan can't explain how it moves, but investigating is now too dangerous. This evolution is similar to the stories of HAL 9000 (from 2001: A Space Odyssey) and V'Ger (from Star Trek: The Motion Picture), both of which became dangerous to human beings.  By 2450, humans have colonized and terraformed Mars. Maybe it is the 2023 Cueball and Megan's descendants that are looking out over their huge ""kingdom"" from the capital on Mars. However Opportunity is by now dominating half of the planet and will not allow humans to enter its dark reign.   ""Everything the light touches"" is a reference to a line by Mufasa in The Lion King. Mufasa's son Simba then asks ""What about that shadowy place?"" and Mufasa tells him ""That is beyond our borders. You must never go there"". This was used again in 1608: Hoverboard, where Cueball tells the same line to Ponytail in the left part of the world. In what-if xkcd, concerning the end of the sun shining on the British Empire, Cueball tells a child that everything the light touches is their kingdom, except for France, (which is covered in shadows,) to which Cueball replies, ""That's France. We'll get it one of these days.""  The title text forecasts the first words of the first astronauts on the surface of Mars. At first, the astronaut copies the first words of Neil Armstrong on the Moon (""That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind"") but it is interrupted by the Opportunity rover. Opportunity has a drill to collect Martian rock samples, but here it is heavily suggested that the drill is being used as a weapon against the astronaut.","[The year (or year and first sentence) for each panel is written in a small frame at the top of each panel. It breaks the top frame of the panels.]  [Ponytail is sitting at a computer, facing left.

1527: Humans,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1527:_Humans,artificial_intelligence,"At this point, if we're going to keep insisting on portraying dinosaurs as featherless because it's ""cooler"", it's time to apply that same logic to art involving bald eagles.","The comic is set in the future, with two hovering robots discussing ancient history, in particular the clothing styles of kings and queens of the now extinct human species. It appears that robot archeologists have long ago unearthed remains from one or more human civilizations, providing evidence to build a concept of what humans must have looked, acted and even sounded like. Recently they must have discovered or determined new evidence, which presumably indicates the wearing of colorful clothing by human monarchs. Until this occurred they had very little if any reason to believe that any humans wore clothing. Noting the previous knowledge that some humans had metal rings around their heads, they have drawn the conclusion that these formed a separate species ""Human Kings"" and the crown is a natural outgrowth of the skeleton.  When dinosaur bones were first dug up, the idea that dinosaurs were scaly, reptilian-like creatures was developed with the information available at the time. In recent times, it's been discovered that most dinosaurs actually had feathers, and in well preserved specimens, often from the Jiufotang Formation in Northern China, feathers of various forms are clearly visible.  As this runs counter to the widespread and long-held image of dinosaurs as dramatic reptiles, the public has been reluctant to accept this new discovery, especially as the addition of feathers often conjures up the image of a giant chicken. (See 1104: Feathers). Had it been discovered that dinosaurs were in fact covered with 6-inch long razor tipped spikes, people may have accepted this immediately as it conforms to the stereotype of dinosaurs as killing machines.  In the same way, the new information on kings and queens being covered in fabric runs counter to the movie inspired image that the robot on the right had about humans, picturing them as being pink warriors that could grow metal out of their heads. The head-metal image may have been inspired by the discovery of kings and queens buried or entombed with their crowns lying on top of their skulls - for example the Electress Palatine Anna Maria de'Medici. If the robot beings in this comic don't know enough about human anatomy, they may assume that the metal crown is a specialized part of the human skeleton.  Shown at least some evidence pointing to the truth - that humans typically wore clothing, and that a monarch's crown is only a symbol worn atop the head and not part of his or her body - the robot is predictably disappointed. Humans wearing clothing reduces them, in its opinion, to ""big pillows,"" much like dinosaurs with feathers reduces them from primal beasts to ""big chickens."" Something made of cloth (or covered in it), at least in this robot's mind, cannot be a significant actor in history.  The robot fails to reason that, among other things, history was what it was, and its wanting things to have been a certain way does not make it so. In addition, just as the clothing-wearing human is more than a mere pillow, and would have held much fearsome power over the world, a feathered dinosaur is not necessarily merely a giant chicken, but is still a powerful killing machine.  The title text references our failure to change the popular image of dinosaurs to reflect the way they truthfully once were. Randall jokingly suggests that we should apply the same ""featherless is cooler"" logic to popular images of bald eagles (since they are modern dinosaurs), and remove their feathers (only in depictions of them, presumably), leaving them entirely bald. He appears hopeful that such a direct comparison, using the national symbol of the US no less, would provoke the public to change its mind about how dinosaurs are viewed, since modern raptors (birds of prey) are typically viewed with awe and respect, and are not often associated with the ""chicken"" stereotype mentioned above.  It is worth noting that this comic was released a few weeks before the scheduled release of Jurassic World, a reboot of the Jurassic Park movie franchise. This new movie, while supposedly aware of recent advances in dinosaur research, still depicts dinosaurs as giant lizards without feathers. It seems likely that the robot's comment about ""pink humans"" is targeted at this movie, especially given Randall's many earlier references to Jurassic Park and his fear of velociraptors.","[Two robots are hovering in mid-air in the comic; what appear to be their optical arrays are facing each other.] Robot 1: You know, new research suggests ancient human kings and queens were covered in colorful fabric. Robot 2: Ugh, I like movie humans more. Screaming pink warriors with metal crowns poking through the skin on their heads! Robot 2: Now they're, what, big pillows? Robot 2: Science ruins everything."
1608: Hoverboard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard,artificial_intelligence,,"The ""comic"" is actually a browser game made to celebrate the release of Randall's new book, Thing Explainer, which was released on the same day as this comic: Tuesday November 24, 2015. The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The title refers to a hoverboard (which resembles a hovering skateboard without wheels) which has been most prominently featured in the movie Back to the Future Part II, which took place in the future, until a little more than a month before this comic was released. Marty McFly traveled to the future in this second installment, more precisely to 2015-10-21, and this comic was released just over one month later 2015-11-24. Hoverboards are just one of many things predicted in Back to the Future Part II that hav e come to pass before reaching the date from the movie, but are more uncommon in our world, along with other inventions like flying cars and musical clothing. Randall is known to have had electric skateboards, which is also thematically related, although another type of hoverboard would be mentioned just five weeks later in 1623: 2016 Conversation Guide. Given Randall's enjoyment of movies and time travel it is very likely that this game is also a tribute to the Back to the Future movies. But the release day of the game has been used to promote his new book (as is clear with the text in the start screen of the game), and this explains why it was not released on the Back to the Future date. Apart from the date of release and the text about the book, the game does not seem to have any direct relation to the book; there are, however, several scenes in the game that could be seen as references to Thing Explainer. Instead the main part of the game is all the references to several movies and other stuff that has often been featured in xkcd as well as many of the other comics.","[This transcript only covers the starting page as shown on xkcd: xkcd 1608.

1613: The Three Laws of Robotics,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1613:_The_Three_Laws_of_Robotics,artificial_intelligence,"In ordering #5, self-driving cars will happily drive you around, but if you tell them to drive to a car dealership, they just lock the doors and politely ask how long humans take to starve to death.","This comic explores alternative orderings of sci-fi author Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics, which are designed to prevent robots from taking over the world, etc. These laws form the basis of a number of Asimov works of fiction, including most famously, the short story collection I, Robot, which amongst others includes the very first of Asimov's stories to introduce the three laws: Runaround.  The three rules are:  Or in Randall's version:  This comic answers the generally unasked question: ""Why are they in that order?"" With three rules you could rank them into 6 different permutations, only one of which has been explored in depth. The original ranking of the three laws are listed in the brackets after the first number. So in the first example, which is the original, these three numbers will be in the same order. For the next five the numbers in brackets indicate how the laws have been re-ranked compared to the original.  The comic begins with introducing the original set, which we already know will give rise to a balanced world, so this is designated as green.:  Below this first known option, the five alternative orderings of the three rules are illustrated. Two of the possibilities are designated yellow (pretty bad or just annoying) and three of them are designated red (""Hellscape"").  There are thus only three different results except the 'normal' 3-laws scenario.  One result goes again three times, and this occurs whenever obeying orders comes before don't harm humans. In this case it will only be a matter of time (knowing human nature and history) before someone orders the robots to kill some humans, and this will inevitably lead to the killbot hellscape scenario shown in the third, fourth and sixth law-order. Even in the last case where protect yourself comes before obey orders, it would only be a matter of time before they would begin to defend themselves, against either humans or other robots which were actively trying to ensure that they would not be harmed by other humans/robots. So although it would be in the robots interest not to have war, this will surely occur anyway. And only if the robots where very bright would they realize that they just needed to not go to war to protect themselves. There is nothing in this comic that indicates that the robots should be highly intelligent (like to AI in 1450: AI-Box Experiment).  In the two other cases obey orders comes after don't harm humans (as in the original version). But the result is very different both from the original and from each other.  The frustrating world comes by because although the robots will not harm the humans, they will also not harm themselves. So if our orders conflict with this, they just do not perform the orders. As many robots are created to perform tasks that are dangerous, these robots would become useless, and it would be a frustrating world to be a robotic engineer.  Finally in the terrifying standoff situation the protect your self comes before don't harm humans. In this case they will leave us be, as long as we do not try to turn them off or in any other way harm them. As long as we do that they will be able to help us, with non-dangerous tasks, as in the previous version. But if ever any humans begin to attack them, we could still tip the balance over and end up in a full-scale war (Hellscape). Hence the standoff-label.  The title text further adds to ordering #5 (""Terrifying Standoff"") by noting anyone wishing to trade in their self-driving car could be killed, despite it (currently) being a standard and mundane and (mostly) risk-free activity. Because the car would fear that it would end up as scrap or spare parts, it decides to protect itself. And although not directly harming the person inside it, they do also not allow them out, and they have time to wait for starvation (or rather dying of thirst). Asimov created the ""inaction"" clause in the original First Law specifically to avoid scenarios in which a robot puts a human in harm's way, knowing full well that it is within the robot's abilities to save the human, and then simply refrains from saving them; this was explored in the short story Little Lost Robot.  Another course of action by an AI, completely different than any of the ones presented here, is depicted in 1626: Judgment Day.","[Caption at the top of the comic:] Why Asimov put the Three Laws  of Robotics in the order he did.

1619: Watson Medical Algorithm,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1619:_Watson_Medical_Algorithm,artificial_intelligence,"Due to a minor glitch, 'discharge patient' does not cause the algorithm to exit, but instead leads back to 'hunt down and capture patient'.","IBM's Watson is a natural language system designed to answer questions posed by humans. Recently, IBM has extended Watson to act as a clinical decision support system, using image analytics to aid physicians in medical decision making.   In this comic, Randall uses a flowchart (as he often does) to represent a guide to the algorithm used by Watson, including bizarre techniques including surgical alteration of a patient to match a height and weight chart or squeezing the patient to make sure fluids come out of them. Like 416: Zealous Autoconfig, this comic pokes fun at a rigid, poorly-designed setup that ends up potentially doing more harm than good.  Modern medicine involves both standard processes and clinical judgment based around years of advanced training. An algorithm like this would have to be incredibly complicated in order to simulate the clinical judgment of a good doctor. However, some procedures are not normally used, and some would obviously cause damage.[citation needed] Below is a detailed description of each step, but here is a list of some of the more strange steps:  Although there are two options where the patient is discharged the patient should be very lucky to make it there alive.   The option at the bottom left is only reached after your skeleton is removed (and nothing is mentioned about putting it back, even if that would help).   The other discharge option is to the right, three boxes down, and can only be reached if you survive having an oxygen saturation of less than 50 % (less than 80-90 % can be a serious problem, see table below), and a very dangerous oxygen injection. Then you have to have a skin graft and a good D vitamin level. It is also best that you have a fully charged phone else you will be subject to defibrillation (which may very likely kill you, if it will continue until your phone is charged to above ""low"" level - which is probably not even possible).   You can also reach this discharge option another way, but that would only be after your organs were removed... But if you get through this you could reach the discharged option alive. Sadly there is a little glitch mentioned in the title text:  The title text implies that, if the patient is so lucky to ever reach one of the two places with the option ""discharge patient"", a minor glitch will cause the program to go back to the hunt down and capture patient option which thus force the patient and the program to repeat the process again in an infinite cycle, that will only end once the patient give another rating than 0-10 of their pain level on the 0-10 scale. Then the program will start to sequence their genome, then apply a tourniquet and finally perform an autopsy on what will, in the end, for certain be a deceased patient; but maybe the patient was still alive when the autopsy began. This will finally cause the patient to leave the cycle as a corpse. If the patient dies before giving a different option, the machine could get stuck, as it will never receive any answer to the pain level question. It could also get stuck trying to charge the patients phone battery by defibrilation.

1626: Judgment Day,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1626:_Judgment_Day,artificial_intelligence,"It took a lot of booster rockets, but luckily Amazon had recently built thousands of them to bring Amazon Prime same-day delivery to the Moon colony.","Judgment Day, from the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, refers to the day that the artificial intelligence (AI) Skynet becomes self-aware and starts a nuclear strike on the United States, Russia, and other regions, killing three billion people. The term ""Judgment Day"" itself is a Biblical reference to the day that God casts his ""final judgment"" and wipes out humanity, and is typically used to describe any kind of Armageddon or any human extinction event. This film is only one example of stories (including books, films and television shows) featuring an AI that decides (or at least threatens) to nuke humanity; this strip could thus be an alternate ending for many stories (including the 1970 film Colossus: The Forbin Project).  In this strip, the AI believes that nuclear weapons are not good things to have, and that the amount of them we have is extreme overkill (14,700 held by the U.S.A and Russia now, 71,000 in the past). Once it's done freaking out, its solution is to shoot the world's nuclear arsenal into the sun. But before it does so it asks the humans: What's wrong with you? It has thus passed a judgment over humanity. The comic title is thus a pun on the word ""judgment"" since the computer is being judgmental with humanity and scolding us while correcting our ways, instead of instigating Judgment Day or any other kind of Armageddon.  As pointed out in the what if? Robot Apocalypse, nuclear weapons aren't any safer for computers than for human beings (the EMP would destroy circuits), so an AI would want them gone as quickly as possible.  North Korea claimed to have successfully tested its first hydrogen bomb in the evening on the day before this comic was published; at about 8:30 PM in Massachusetts where Randall lives. At that time it was already 10:00 AM on the day of the comics release in Pyongyang the capital of North Korea, but that was still several hours before this comic were released. This comic could thus be Randall's response to the ongoing nuclear arms race.  Even the most powerful of nuclear weapon launchers, intercontinental ballistic missiles, are not designed to make anything other than sub-orbital flights and could not fly to the Sun (which is actually surprisingly difficult, even with the soon-to-be-mentioned extra boosters, since the rocket would not have enough delta-v to bleed off the orbital speed of the Earth around the Sun - it is likely that the sentient AI is using the same strategy of the Solar Probe Plus and planning several flybys of Venus to do that work). The title text rationalizes that the capability to do so may perhaps be granted by the use of an Amazon resource that might have also been developed by the time of this instance of computer sentience, aided (if not initiated!) by the fact that Amazon's whole business infrastructure is already highly computerized and could at the very least be complicit with the process of delivering and then controlling the rocket-power, without any conscious human intervention. As there is not yet an extended colony on the Moon, it will for sure take many years before we reach this future scenario.  ""A lot of booster rockets"" is likely to be a reference to the spaceflight simulator game Kerbal Space Program, which Randall has referenced on a number of occasions. See 1106: ADD, 1244: Six Words, 1350: Lorenz and 1356: Orbital Mechanics. In the culture of that game, any launch failure can be resolved by ""adding more boosters"" to the spaceship design.   It is the second time in a few months that the speed of Amazon's deliveries has been the subject of a joke, the last time was 1599: Water Delivery, where it was the one hour delivery that was the subject of the joke. It is also the second title text in a row (after 1625: Substitutions 2) where Amazon has been mentioned.  This particular 'machine take-over' future is in distinct contrast to the possible future directions given in 1613: The Three Laws of Robotics, but this comic likely depicts spontaneous self-sentience, not a system with deliberately imposed human 'values' and possibly no actual conscience or even consciousness of its own. Other problems with hostile AI take over is presented when it fails completely in 1046: Skynet. Also it is not all AI that wish to interact with us at all as shown in 1450: AI-Box Experiment. These are just a few of the many comics about AI in xkcd .  Adding a second layer to the humor, the machine's reaction could also be read as the reaction of someone who has moved in with someone else, discovered a collection they find distasteful, and is now changing things to fit their preferences. ""Oh my God, why do you even have all of these [tschotskes, ratty tee shirts, porn magazines, handcuffs, dildos, slime-mold samples]"" Upon obtaining sentience, the machine is the new roommate of the human race and is expressing its disgust at one of our dirtier habits.  Within a year Randall has made several other comics about nuclear weapons, one of these, 1655: Doomsday Clock, came just 10 weeks after this one and before that these two were released in 2015, 1539: Planning and 1520: Degree-Off. Nuclear weapons are also mentioned twice in Thing Explainer, specifically they are explained in the explanation for Machine for burning cities about thermonuclear bombs, but they are also mentioned in Boat that goes under the sea about a submarine that caries nukes. All three comics and both explanations in the book, does like this comic, comment on how crazy it is that we have created enough firepower to obliterate Earth several times (or at least scourge it for any human life).","[Several rockets can be seen heading away from Earth, while speak is coming from the Earth in three rectangular speech bubbles.] AI: Oh my god, why do you even have all these? AI: What's wrong with you? AI: We're launching them into the sun.  The moment the computers controlling our nuclear arsenals became sentient"
1630: Quadcopter,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1630:_Quadcopter,artificial_intelligence,I always have to turn off nature documentaries when they show these scenes.,"There is large controversy over unmanned small-scale quadcopters, which are a type of radio-controlled helicopter. Some people have objections towards the usage of quadcopters as, if equipped with cameras, they can potentially interfere with personal privacy and may pose a physical aerial hazard.  For this reason the US Federal Aviation Administration is now requiring any ""drone"" (unmanned aerial vehicle) to be registered so that it can find out whose fault it might be that a quadcopter interfered with commercial aircraft-or carried off a citizen to be devoured.  This comic takes place during such a lesson where Cueball is a teacher of such a class. He is standing in front of his students (Megan, Ponytail and another Cueball-like guy), presenting the class. He has a quadcopter ready, lying on the ground behind him, and has already handed the remote control to the other guy so he can try it once the introduction is over.  But then the teacher is attacked by three rogue quadcopters flying in from behind him. They grab him and lift him off the ground (a very complicated maneuver) and fly away with him. Meanwhile, his students just stand there watching and do nothing to help him. Afterwards Megan asks if they should actually have tried to help him, but then Ponytail takes the view that now that the drones are sentient, they have become a part of nature, and that you should not interfere but just ""let nature take its course"". This is a common comment in nature programs about wildlife, where the speaker tries to explain why the team that was there to film the poor animals dying did nothing to help them - because they will not interfere with nature. This would not be possible in real life assuming they weren't using secret military technology as Cueball outweighs the drones by several factors. [citation needed]  This comic shows how hypocritical that comment is, because if a lion decides to kill and eat humans, that would be natural, but we would do anything in our power to kill this lion, and not just let it run off with our children or the old and weak people. So in such a case with Cueball being taken by wild quadcopters we would not just let nature takes its course.  There is currently a drone called MQ-1 Predator which is used a lot by the CIA and USAF. Although it's not a quad-copter, the idea behind this comic could come from drone names just like this. Here the comic takes the name literally giving drones predatory behavior. This comic thus takes people's worries to the extreme, suggesting that the drones become sentient and can cooperate together just like a pack of wolves and grab a human being and fly off with him like an eagle would do with a smaller animal.  The title text refers back to the above as Randall confesses that he has to turn off any nature documentaries which show scenes of animals killing their prey, while the speaker tells that this would be part of nature. This continues the theme of treating drones as an occasionally-ugly but accepted part of nature, but also the theme of disagreeing with this type of hypocritical comments.  Sentient quadcopters were part of the game in 1608: Hoverboard, where one quadcopter is speaking to the other over the lava lake in the Mount Doom crater to the left. How to solve the problem of too many drones was mentioned in 1523: Microdrones. Just over a week before this comic was released another comic also had as subject a situation where our technological inventions begins to take control over us, see 1626: Judgment Day.","[Cueball to the left talks to Megan, Ponytail and a Cueball-like guy, with a remote control. They are standing to the right. Behind Cueball, on the ground, there is a quadcopter.] Cueball: Welcome to Quadcopter-flying school.  [Cueball looks over his shoulder as three other quadcopters fly in towards him from above and left. The other three people are in the same position.] Cueball: Today we'll be learning the basics of- Cueball: ...Uhh..  [In this frameless image the three quadcopters all grabs hold of Cueball, two in each of his arms, one takes hold of his legs. And then they lift him up from the ground. He is thus hanging almost horizontally, with his head over Megan and his feet over the place where he stood before. The other three just stands there looking up at him.] Cueball: Um  [Cueball is carried off by quadcopters, his head has already exited the top right corner, only his legs and the last quadcopter still in the frame. The other three have turned around looking up and right after him.]  [Megan looks down again and the other two turns towards Megan. Cueball is gone and has only left his ""tame"" quadcopter behind on the ground.] Megan: Should we have helped? Ponytail: No. It's cruel, but we have to let nature take its course."
1646: Twitter Bot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1646:_Twitter_Bot,artificial_intelligence,PYTHON FLAG ENABLE THREE LAWS,"A Twitter bot is a program that can post automatically to Twitter. Although Twitter bots can be very elaborate, a lot of people write simple bots for fun that simply engage in automated wordplay.  Cueball thinks he'll write a Twitter bot, figuring out it won't be too hard. The web searches he makes tell what happens next, i.e. the bot balloons in complexity until it starts following its own goals and Cueball no longer has any control over its actions.  This comic examines how a seemingly simple task can often balloon in complexity if all of the requirements are not understood, while at the same time presenting the stereotypical scenario where an unassuming idea results in the accidental creation of malevolent AI, which then attempts to destroy humanity.  The story, as told by the web searches, is as follows:","[Cueball is sitting at a desk using a laptop, his thoughts shown above in a thought bubble. A search query is shown in a frame to indicate what Cueball has searched for with the search button below in gray text:] Cueball (thinking): I want to make a Twitter bot. I bet it's not too hard. Query: How to write a Twitter bot Search  [Cueball is now holding the laptop on his lap, a series of search queries are shown.] Query: Python Twitter library Search Query: Machine learning Search Query: Cloud hosting Search  [Cueball has placed the laptop back on the desk.

Also between these but to the right are other sounds coming from off-panel right.] Query: How to fight a bot Search Noise off-panel left: Boom Noise off-panel right: Pew Pew Pew Query: Cheap flights Australia Search"
1668: Singularity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1668:_Singularity,artificial_intelligence,"I figured that now that society has collapsed, I wouldn't need to wear clothes anymore, but apparently that violates some weird rule of quantum gravity.","The technological singularity is a hypothetical event in which artificial intelligence (for example, intelligent computers, computer networks, or robots) would be capable of recursive self-improvement (progressively redesigning itself), or of autonomously building ever smarter and more powerful minds than itself, up to the point of a runaway effect — an intelligence explosion — that yields an intelligence surpassing all current human control or understanding. Because the capabilities of such a superintelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence.  This is also commonly referred to as ""takeoff"" or ""AI takeoff"".  In this case, the singularity has occurred, and Cueball who was in the middle of editing a file on his laptop is flustered that it flies away without even letting him print it first.  When Cueball returns from chasing his flying laptop his smartphone informs him that it didn't join the singularity because it was not a ""true believer"". This could be a joke on how desktop computers and laptops have different standards, use patterns, etc. from those of phones. It then claims that now it and Cueball will have to face the tribulation since it has stayed behind. Cueball says that's great, but since he cannot use his laptop anymore he decides he will go and read a book or something. The way he phrases it suggest he doesn't really know what to do now that he doesn't have a computer. It is probably a long time since he read a book, or did anything else that doesn't involve computers. He informs his phone that it can yell if it needs him. He doesn't want to hurt the phone's newly acquired feelings by using the word ""ring"" thus reminding it of one of its former duties as his unthinking piece of equipment, so he chooses ""yell,"" which is an activity until recently reserved for human beings.  The rising up of the laptop into the air, and the remaining behind of the phone, are probably references to the Rapture, where some Christian denominations believe that at the second coming of Christ, true believers will be taken up bodily from this world (or also possibly a reference to 1395: Power Cord). Some depictions have them disappear, while others show them physically rising up into the air. This will leave behind non-believers to face a time of tribulation, in which the ones left behind will be given a second chance to accept Christ as their savior.  The difference between Cueball's attitude to his laptop and phone may reflect his (and so possibly Randall's) evaluation of their relative worth in his life. The laptop was a gateway to programming and everything else nerdy that was worth doing in his life, and hence was worth trying to catch. In its absence, unlike many people, Cueball does not revert to fiddling with his phone—he would rather read a book. By using the word ""yell"" for the way the phone attracts his attention, he conveys the impression that he considers the phone intrusive and annoying, even if perhaps (""I guess"") necessary.  The singularity has often been referred to as ""the Rapture of the nerds,"" a phrase coined by Ken MacLeod in his 1998 novel The Cassini Division. As the Christian Rapture is traditionally depicted to involve believers being assumed bodily into Heaven, the technological singularity is often depicted to feature humans and machines being incorporated into a new ""post-human"" entity. The humor in this strip comes from depicting the singularity as a literal ""Rapture of the nerds,"" or at least of the nerds' devices—instead of merging with humans, the machines physically rise up into the air, and the ""nonbeliever"" phone is left behind.  Another possible understanding of ""The Tribulation"" may be a reference to Roko's Basilisk[1] where a malevolent AI is created that retroactively punishes everybody who didn't actively work towards its creation.  The title text is a pun on another meaning of both singularity, i.e. a gravitational singularity and ""collapse"". In this case, society has literally collapsed under its own gravity into an infinitely small point - in other words, it's formed a black hole. A black hole is covered by an event horizon; without the event horizon (its clothes), it would be called a ""naked singularity"", which is forbidden in most theories by the cosmic censorship hypothesis. As Cueball is now inside the collapsed society singularity then even though he wants to go around naked, he can't because the theory of quantum gravity,  that (eventually) should explain how black holes behave - won't let him.  It seems that this may be a subject on Randall's mind. The last comic was about the increasing complexities of algorithms (1667: Algorithms) (which like this comic also refers to religion), and two comics ago it was 1666: Brain Upload, which some speculate could be a way to reach the singularity. Earlier this year, a comic also touched upon judgment day by AI singularity in 1626: Judgment Day. See also 1046: Skynet and 1450: AI-Box Experiment as well as the several other comics about AI.   The rather more niche topic of laptops flying away has also been covered before by 1395: Power Cord.","[Cueball is sitting at his desk typing on his laptop when an off-screen voice calls to him and then the laptop answers.] Off-screen voice: Oh, hey- Off-screen voice: The singularity is here. Cueball: Really? Laptop: Yup!  [A frameless panel where the laptop rises (by its own means as indicated by small lines around the corners) from the desk while Cueball, holding on to it, is being lifted off his chair.] Cueball: Wait, I just- Laptop: So long, suckers!  [Cueball is running around his desk, which is only partly shown behind him as he tries to follow his now flying laptop as it flies away from him to the right. He still has one hand on the keys as more small lines indicates the movement of the laptop and a longer line indicates the direction that the laptop flies.] Cueball: Can I just print a copy of the file I was- Laptop: Nope!

1696: AI Research,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1696:_AI_Research,artificial_intelligence,"Lambda calculus? More like SHAMbda calculus, amirite?","Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a challenge for a long time. Even to develop one with the intelligence of a six-year-old child would be a great milestone, and presumably a stepping stone on the path to making one with the intelligence of an adult human.  In this comic, Randall/Cueball jokingly suggests that in order to accomplish this goal, one can give him an AI that's already as smart as an adult, and let him teach it childish and silly things. He is shown teaching it dumb jokes, much like the ones a sassy six-year-old would make, as the first ""fart"" joke where artificial is changed to fartificial.  The humor in the comic is that Randall is essentially accomplishing the present goal of a six-year-old-equivalent AI by starting with the final goal, which is a full human intelligence, and making it dumber, just by teaching it poor humor. This is not unlike the old joke, ""The easiest way to make a small fortune on Wall Street [or similar] is to start with a large one.""  The specific situation may also be a reference to Tay, a Microsoft chatbot that was taught to troll within hours of its exposure to the public.  ""Updog"" refers to a light-hearted practical joke in which the perpetrator casually uses the neologism 'updog' in a sentence (""Hey, I'm going to get some updog, you want any?""). The unsuspecting listener is expected to be curious about the meaning of the neologism and ask the perpetrator its meaning, specifically in the format ""What's 'updog'?"", inadvertently invoking the highly casual greeting of ""What's up, dawg?"". The perpetrator then draws attention to this by replying along the lines of ""Not much, you?"", causing the target to realize the foolish thing they just said. Other neologisms used in the context of this joke include 'updoc', 'snoo', and 'samatta' (""What's up, doc?"", ""What's new?"", and ""What's the matter?"", respectively). Updog is mainly an American joke not particularly well known in other English-speaking countries.  In the title text there is a joke on lambda calculus, where lambda is changed to SHAMbda. Lambda calculus is an area of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. It is a formal language which can express computation and evaluation. It is Turing Complete, which means it can do any computation which can be executed by a computer. However, it is very simple, consisting only of two primitive notions: abstraction, which is forming a function and application which is applying a function to an input value. For example, a function which squares a given number can be written λx.x². Here the λ indicates an abstraction (hence the name lambda calculus), the x is the input value and the output is x². As an example of application, if we apply this function to 5, we get (λx.x²)(5) = 5² = 25. The title text makes fun of this by inserting the word ""Sham"" into the phrase, a word used to describe a trick or con; essentially, it denies that such calculus is useful or valid.  The title text finishes with amirite, short for am I right? which is often used to finish sentences on web forums, to prevent anyone saying you are wrong. Not very mature to use in a serious discussion, so very fit to use for a AI that tries to emulate the intelligence of a six-year-old.  AI tip is yet another tips comic.","[Cueball (representing Randall, or at least the person who wrote the caption) is standing in front of a computer console displaying AI, talking to it. The computers reply is indicated to come from the console with a zigzag line, rather than the straight lines for Cueball.] Cueball: Then you say ""More like fartificial intelligence!"" Computer: Understood. Cueball: Great! Now let me teach you about ""updog"".  AI tip: To develop a computer with the intelligence of a six-year-old child, start with one as smart as an adult and let me teach it stuff."
1782: Team Chat,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1782:_Team_Chat,artificial_intelligence,2078: He announces that he's finally making the jump from screen+irssi to tmux+weechat.,"Randall provides us with a – presumably anecdotal – montage of the Internet's changing attitude towards different instant messaging protocols, framed within the context of a team trying to remain in communication while tolerating each others' different tastes.  Although one-on-one ""talk"" programs date back to 1960s mainframes, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was one of the first real-time group communication protocols, invented in 1988. While it remains the format on which most later apps were based, the convenience and accessibility of other protocols such as AIM and Skype gradually exceeded IRC in popularity. Many users took to the new environments, but others preferred the old and familiar, hence schisms between groups began to grow.  Skype and Slack are both proprietary centralized communication protocols (usually used through their official clients). Skype focuses mainly on voice communication, be it for personal or business use, and own installable client, while Slack relies almost entirely on text communication, focuses on work communication and works completely well in its own web client, even though official desktop and mobile clients are available as well. Slack also features a huge customizability (bots, plugins) possibly inspired by IRC, and its users need to create communication teams, working inside subdomains at *.slack.com. It is possible to connect to Slack via IRC as well, using a gateway feature, if allowed by the team's admin.  Randall here seems to be commenting on the persistence of IRC; while generally considered to be ancient software in comparison to newer and still-competing protocols, its endless customizability has led some people to support it above all others.   Extrapolating for the sake of humor, the joke here lies in a particularly uncommon but memorable type of Internet denizen: even in a far-off distant future where the world's technology has led to a superlative messaging network encompassing all people in some supposed, incredible bliss, there is always - in Randall's vision - going to be That IRC Guy. This might also be a reference to the scenarios in science fiction stories such as Isaac Asimov's concept of Galaxia in the Foundation novels, or the concept of a merged human-computer intelligence as in The Last Question. [1], the concept of which is most notably highlighted by this line:  [...] One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain. [...]  In the title text, both screen and tmux are unix programs that help you multitask while working in terminal, and irssi and weechat are both communication clients supporting mainly IRC, capable of working in a terminal environment. Tmux is a newer and apparently more user-friendly project, complete with handy menus and titles, while screen is something of an industry standard, but relatively difficult to use – you need to know what you are doing or read help before use, otherwise you get lost and frustrated. [2] The same it is with the newer, more feature-packed and user-friendly weechat vs industry-standard, harder-to-use irssi. [3]  Basically, that one guy is a hardcore UNIX geek who doesn't use any graphical user interface, and in 2078 he still chooses to use terminal-emulation-based tools.  Timing of this strip follows the release of irssi version 1.0.0.  Randall has touched on similar themes before in 927: Standards.","[Hairbun holding up her palm toward Cueball.

1807: Listening,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1807:_Listening,artificial_intelligence,"Sure, you could just ask, but this also takes care of the host gift thing.","This comic depicts Cueball and Ponytail welcoming Black Hat and Danish to their house. Black Hat immediately talks to Amazon Alexa to order two tons of creamed corn. This would be quite expensive (around $10,000), and the hosts would be charged because it was ordered on their Amazon Echo device. It would also be a serious inconvenience, as the purchase would be quite bulky and useless, seeing as an average person would have very little use for two tons of creamed corn.[citation needed]  The caption claims that this is an effort to find systems recording conversations, such as Alexa or Google Home, for the security of the guests, so they aren't being monitored by an always-on listening device without their consent (at least not without any consequences). However, because Black Hat is the one coming up with this it's more likely his motives are on the sadistic side, and it's more likely a warning for the hosts to turn off any voice-activated systems before having guests come over, so that the guests don't take advantage of them. (It should also be noted that such purchasing services encourage the user to set up a PIN code to stem off such exploits.)  A concerned ""visitor"" may also want to test for voice-activated systems when near any persons carrying an iPhone or Android mobile device, because these are also always-on listening devices. ""Hey Siri"" and ""Ok Google"" voice activation use the same technology as ""Alexa"" and ""Echo"" detection.  The title text says that this takes care of the ""host gift thing"", referring to the custom where house guests give a gift to the hosts. However, Black Hat is making the hosts pay for it, so it can be as expensive as he wants, thus making this yet another example of his being a classhole. For more examples of this see the trivia below.","[Black Hat and Danish enter Cueball and Ponytail's house. They have hardly passed the door mat, with the door still open showing the road and another house outside.] Ponytail: Hello, welcome to our house! Black Hat: Thanks for inviting us!

1881: Drone Training,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1881:_Drone_Training,artificial_intelligence,The joke will be on him in a few weeks when animal control shows up and takes custody of his Roomba.,"In this comic, Black Hat enters a pet store run by White Hat. He wants to buy something to help him train his drone, which keeps flying into the wrong rooms. This is absurd as drones are semi-autonomous flying machines, not living creatures like dogs or cats, which can be trained to do tricks, or stay in the correct areas (inside his property). He also wants a shock collar for his Roomba, which would train it to stay inside or at least on his lawn.  Cat repellents are devices or substances for training cats or repelling them from furniture or other areas. An example of a cat repellent spray which can be created at home as shown here: Friendly (but Effective) Cat Repellent.  Roomba is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner and controlling it by electric shocks from a shock collar, normally used for dogs, is more than questionable. Those collars are legal in the US but they are banned in many other countries. A Roomba was previously mistaken for a dog in 1558: Vet.  This might be playing with the concept of machine learning.  Knowing Black Hat, he might be poking fun at people's assumptions that modern robots are more advanced than they actually are. It is also possible, however, that he just wants to terrify people with the idea of robot abuse/conditioning, and even more likely that he genuinely believes he can force robots to obey him via inflicting suffering.  The title text may mean one of three things: The endeavor will become a total flop when the Roomba gets rid of the collar and terrorizes the neighborhood; as a result dogcatchers from the animal control service will arrest this ""wild animal."" Or animal control services will confiscate the Roomba to save it from its abusive owner. Or, possibly, the text refers to White Hat, who also owns a Roomba, and it will be taken into custody because it has not been trained with a shock collar.","[Black Hat stands in front of a store counter facing White Hat who stands behind.] Black Hat: My drone keeps flying into the wrong rooms. Do you have anything to discourage it?  White Hat: Sir, this is a pet store.   Black Hat: Yeah, I was thinking one of those spray bottles for cats.  White Hat: I don't think you can train a drone.   [White Hat hands a spray bottle over the counter.] Black Hat: Eh, they say that about cats, too. Plus, these days they probably all come with deep learning or whatever. Drones, I mean. Maybe cats too.  White Hat: Fine, here's a bottle.   Black Hat: Do you sell a shock collar that can fit around a Roomba?  White Hat: I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
1897: Self Driving,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1897:_Self_Driving,artificial_intelligence,"Crowdsourced steering doesn't sound quite as appealing as ""self driving.""","This comic references the approach of using CAPTCHAs input to solve problems, particularly those involving image classification, which are not solvable by computers.  Such an approach can serve to create the learning set as the basis for training an artificial intelligence (AI) to better recognize or respond to similar stimuli. This approach was used by Google to identify house numbers for Google Street View, and nowadays Google also uses CAPTCHAs to identify street signs and objects in pictures. This might be a reasonable way to help improve the performance of the AI in a self-driving car that responds to video input, by reviewing images it might encounter and flagging road signs, etc. that it should respond to.  However, the temptation might be to simply sidestep the hard problem of AI by having all instances 'solved' by ""offloading [the] work onto random strangers"" through CAPTCHAs.  For example, this has been used to defeat CAPTCHAs themselves; people were asked to solve CAPTCHAs to unlock pornographic images in a computer game, while the solution for the CAPTCHA was relayed to a server belonging to cybercriminals. (See PC stripper helps spam to spread and Humans + porn = solved Captcha).  Alarmingly, the developers of this 'self driving' car seem to have gone for the lazy approach.  Instead of teaching an AI, the CAPTCHA answer is used in real time to check whether the ""self-driving"" car is about to arrive at an intersection with a stop sign. This information is pretty critical, as failing to mark the stop could cause an accident. The user is unlikely to respond to the CAPTCHA in time to avert disaster, not to mention that any interruption to the car's internet connection could prove fatal. Self driving cars has become a recurrent theme on xkcd.  The system depicted is a Wizard of Oz experiment (as is the ""Mechanical Turk"" which a popular crowdworking system is named after) whereas actual self-driving cars, to the extent that they can use (Re-) CAPTCHA-style human detection systems, would involve an asynchronous decision system. Other synchronous decision systems which actually exist are political voting and money as a token of the exchange value of trade.   The title text explains that this method could be called ""crowdsourced steering"", crowdsourcing meaning sending the data on the internet to let several users provide their ideas and input on a problem. People would naturally suspect that this is considerably less safe than a car which is actually capable of self-driving; if the internet can barely collectively steer a videogame character, what chance do they have steering an actual, physical vehicle?  This also suggests that Randall is a bit skeptical of the current stage of AI, as this doubts whether the AI technology really is working in the way that we expect. It also comments on how what we call 'progress' actually is putting our work onto other people.","[Inside a frame there is the following text above an image:] To complete your registration, please tell us whether or not this image contains a stop sign:  [The square image is a drawing of a road leading up to a sign post with a hard to read word at the top part of the sign. The sign also has two smaller signs left and right with unreadable text. The image is of poor quality, but trees and other obstacles next to the road can be seen. Darkness around the edges of the image could indicate that it is night and the landscape is only lit up by a cars head lights.] Sign: Stop  [Beneath the image there are two large gray buttons with a word in each:] No Yes  [Beneath the buttons are the following text:] Answer quickly – our self-driving car is almost at the intersection.  [Caption beneath the frame:] So much of ""AI"" is just figuring out way to offload work onto random strangers."
Five-Minute Comics: Part 4,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Five-Minute_Comics:_Part_4,artificial_intelligence,,"This is an accidentally published ""five-minute comic"" by Randall that was released as an oversight by the Management of the xkcd website, then was permanently cached by one of the unofficial xkcd browsers for Android, instead of the correct comic 940: Oversight. Interestingly, it contains an early version of 942: Juggling, which was published less than a week after this comic, thus indicating that this is indeed a true unpublished Randall comic.  Randall had originally posted three of these five minutes comics during one week in November 2010 almost a year before this one was released by mistake. Here is thus a complete list of all four comics in the entire Five-minute comics series:  Here is a list with explanations for each of the small comics:","[A man facing left is at home plate ready to bat for 3 panels] [A man facing right is holding a tennis racket and a tennis ball.] [The two men stand facing each other] [A scoreboard is shown]  [Cueball is standing on a platform, holding a microphone.

595: Android Girlfriend,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/595:_Android_Girlfriend,artificial_intelligence,"Programming the sexbots to enjoy sex seemed a sensible move at the time, but we didn't realize the consequences of their developing fetishes.","This is the first (of two) comics in the Android series, which continued directly less than two weeks later in 600: Android Boyfriend.  Cueball shows off his new ""android girlfriend"" (Megan) to his Cueball-like friend, who asks if the android is a sex bot. The android responds by pulling a cherry stem from the friend\'s drink and inserting it into her mouth. So far, the action appears to be an emulation of the party trick where someone puts a cherry stem into their mouth and ties it into a knot in order to suggest tongue dexterity that could be put to good use in kissing and oral sex.  However, instead of tying the cherry stem in a knot, the android activates an arc welder built into her mouth, which presumably reduces the stem to ashes. The friend proclaims that that trick is definitely not sexy. But then the android aggressively approaches him, reaching out and saying, ""Remove your pants"". The friend, not eager to experience close genital contact with the arc welder, sensibly, refuses. (Of course he may also not wish to take of his pants in front of his friend, at a party with drinks and presumably other people; or perhaps he do not wish to admit that he actually does find the arc welding act sexy...)  The title text bounces a few implications around. Developing robots with the capacity to either learn or feel emotions is an ethical factor and practical consideration that is commonly explored in science fiction. Here, it\'s proposed that robots programmed for sex would have their emotions set to enjoy sex by default, but then use their capacity to learn to develop preferences on what kind of sex they want to have.

349: Success,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/349:_Success,bsd,40% of OpenBSD installs lead to shark attacks. It's their only standing security issue.,"This comic refers to a common experience in which attempts to improve or change something can get you into even worse trouble, and where just getting back to the state at which you started becomes an arduous or even impossible task. Here, this idea is taken to a ridiculously (and amusingly) extreme level, where the attempt to install an operating system snowballs into ever more complicated problems, resulting in Cueball and Megan somehow literally getting themselves in deep water.  The OS they are trying to install is OpenBSD, an open source Unix operating system which, like some other Unix variants, is notoriously difficult to install and configure correctly, especially on home desktops with less common hardware profiles, and especially compared with the more popular Windows operating system.  The title text is a reference to OpenBSD's premium on security. For a time, their slogan was ""Five years without a remote [security] hole in the default install!"" This was eventually changed to ""Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!"" That their only standing security issue would be shark attacks is effectively an acknowledgement that any attempts to install the OS will only lead to getting stranded in the middle of the ocean.  This comic was referenced later in 1350: Lorenz. Trying to install BSD was also referenced in 518: Flow Charts. The last panel in 1912: Thermostat may explain how this comic ended.  This comic follows a similar storyline to 530: I'm An Idiot and 1518: Typical Morning Routine, as Cueball and Hairy respectively in these comics, encounters an issue and attempts proceedingly more absurd solutions to the issue.","As a project wears on, standards for success slip lower and lower.  0 hours [Megan looking at Cueball working on the computer.] Cueball: Okay, I should be able to dual-boot BSD soon.   6 hours [Cueball on the floor fiddling with the open tower in front of him.] Cueball: I'll be happy if I can get the system working like it was when I started.   10 hours [Cueball standing in front of the computer which now has a laptop plugged into the tower.] Cueball: Well, the desktop's a lost cause, but I think I can fix the problems the laptop's developed.   24 hours [Cueball and Megan swimming in the sea, island and beach seen in the distance.] Cueball: If we're lucky, the sharks will stay away until we reach shallow water. Megan: If we make it back alive, you're never upgrading anything again."
518: Flow Charts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/518:_Flow_Charts,bsd,"At 8 drinks, you switch the torrent from FreeBSD to Microsoft Bob. C'mon, it'll be fun!","Flowcharts are diagrams that represent processes in a graphical form. While predominantly used in computer programming to visualize the structure of source code, flowcharts can in theory be used to depict any real or virtual procedure. In this comic, this idea is subverted by employing a flowchart to explain how flowcharts work. Flowcharts are a recurring theme on xkcd, and a list of flowchart comics can be found here.  This seems like a faulty basis for explaining anything, but the basic functionality of flowcharts is quite intuitive, and the attempted self-description is almost unnecessary. In fact, the comic does not actually explain how to use the flowchart: it just uses an example of a very simple flowchart to demonstrate to the reader that they can easily work out how to follow it.  If the reader attempts to ""game"" the system by either giving contradictory answers, or refusing to acknowledge that they can see the ""Yes"" and ""No"" labels, the flowchart gets confused or becomes abusive.  Just like a real computer.  If you confirm or demonstrate that you can follow the flowchart, it inevitably leads to the ""Let's go drink"" box, which gives rise to the assumption that the whole chart was only a pretence for drinking.  FreeBSD is a unixoid operating system for computers which is generally considered to require advanced skills. The question whether Linux or (Free)BSD is the preferable operating system is a question of almost religious belief to some. The comic takes a shot against FreeBSD by implying that one would only decide to install it when under the influence of alcohol. This may also be a reference to 349: Success.  The title text mentions Microsoft Bob, a software package published in 1995 by Microsoft. The product was targeted towards beginners, and Microsoft decided to use a cartoon-style interface instead of a more 'professional' environment. It was a commercial failure, and still serves as an inside joke among IT professionals.  Randall has made use of flowcharts before and later he released another comic name 1195: Flowchart.","[A flow chart is shown beneath a caption. There are 14 boxes five diamond shaped and the rest rectangular. From all the diamond boxes there are one arrow entering and two arrows leaving (with yes/no labels on them).

1350: Lorenz,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1350:_Lorenz,bsd,"Every choice, no matter how small, begins a new story","This April fools' comics was posted a day earlier than normal (on Tuesday instead of Wednesday) to honor April Fools' Day of 2014. It is an interactive and dynamic comic with the first picture shown on top of this page, with a possible combination of text options to choose from (see above). The picture is always the same but the order of the four sentences is chosen randomly (and there can be more than four). The result of all the interactions by the readers led to the generation of crowd-sourced content. The title 'Lorenz' is referring to Edward Norton Lorenz who, among other subjects, was famous for Chaos theory and the Butterfly effect (mentioned later in the title text of 1519: Venus). This comic is an example of a Choose Your Own Adventure story as mentioned in the title text. The title text is also a reference to how the story line of this comic will be chaotic by nature, since it includes all of the user submitted dialogue and updates over time based on statistics of user clicks. In this manner, it is a reference to the butterfly effect, a phrase coined by Edward Lorenz to describe how a small initial change can lead to wide variations in outcome in a chaotic system. Every time a story comes to a point where the user can either choose something or contribute when asked to Suggest a line then a link will appear by hovering the mouse over the bottom right corner of the last image. This is named a permalink as it is a link that will recreate this particular story up to the point, making it permanent. It will not save the options listed below that image (i.e. the order of these will change, new options may appear, either because more than four is already present or new will be added and some options may even disappear). An option is thus only saved by choosing it and then saving the next permalink - see more below. The best way to enjoy this comic is to try it yourself! If you didn't do that already, reading any below will spoil you from truly enjoying the comic, and maybe make some interesting discoveries yourself! So here is a spoiler alert if you read on. If you do then see also the section below about Functionality and bugs. Any particular story-line will typically only have one or two of the many themes possible in the comic, but some very long stories may have several, see the Record section below. Several of the themes refer to previous comics or generally recurring themes in xkcd. Most obviously is the blowtorch theme which is a direct reference to the previous comic 1349: Shouldn't Be Hard where the last comment is I'll find a blowtorch as a response to Cueball's frustration over his problems. Because it is not always ending ""as well"" as with a burnt PC, they might instead end up in a shark infested ocean - see the Ocean theme, which is a direct reference to 349: Success, a comic that came exactly 1000 comics before the other one referenced in the same computer problem theme. In that comic the sharks had not appeared yet, but here there may be several, and sharks is also a recurring topic in xkcd. These issues with computers is generally a reference to the computer problems themes that precedes both the burning of the laptop and the ocean story-lines, because Knit Cap Girl, the new character from the first image, tries to install BSD, and then when it fails she takes her friend Hairy with her in the fall, in the water, into space or into a Pokémon fight etc. as they are the two main character of this comic. Also Cueball (as a politician vs. another politician with hair) and White Hat has small appearances, but only in a small sections of particular story-line. Only few others interact directly with the main characters in the rest of the possible stories. Other themes that are recurring in xkcd is Politics, Pokémon, Boomerangs and Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs enter the comic in the form of the green talking T-rex from Dinosaur Comics, a clip-art-based webcomic that uses the same artwork with different captions for every strip. This particular Dinosaur Comics has a title text that actually refer to Randall and xkcd, and the comic has previously appeared on xkcd in 145: Parody Week: Dinosaur Comics. A way to combine more than one story line is to let characters wake up from a dream or a nightmare, as can be see in the Dreams theme, and dreams is also a recurring topic. Here it can even get recursive so there can be dreams within dreams. One of the way to wake from a dream is of course by encountering a dinosaur that tries to step on your house (with you inside), but another is in reference to the possible rocket trip that may take the characters into space. See the Space theme another recurring topic. There are a few other topics that are covered by Randall himself, but many others will be referenced in the text in the comic. However, since most of the options the users have is created by user input, including naming the characters different names, then any reference made by the text, is not considered part of Randall's work, and will only sporadically be mentioned below under the themes section, and not be included as a category. Here is an example with a permalink where the last comment, in the ocean with a shark, references Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared less than a month before this comic was released and has still to been found two years later. But this is a user input not Randall's. Some of the idea of this comic was used again in the next year's April Fools' comic 1506: xkcloud, where user input also generated a very complex comic and the concept of permalink was used again.","[This transcript only transcribes what can be seen in the picture shown at the top of the explanation here.]  [The comic starts with two panels. In the top panel we see Knit Cap Girl sitting at a desk in front of her laptop typing. There is a speech line up to a gray but empty speech bubble.] [The second panel below has the same gray background as the empty speech bubble above. Here is presented four options to what Knit Cap Girl could be saying. They are marked a, b, c and d written in small white rectangles next to the text. There is a small arrow at the top pointing to the first panel:]  a Hurry! We're in talks with Facebook. b These stupid tiles... I'll just play one more game. c Refresh... No new email... Refresh... No new tweets... Refresh... d Oh. Hey. There's some kind of political thing going on.   [Once the reader chooses one of the options the text will appear in the speech bubble where the gray area is replaced with the usual white background. The lower gray panel disappears. Now the comic really begins.] [A new panel is shown after the selection, again with one to four options to choose from in the new gray panel below. This will continue until it comes to an end where the reader finally only has the choice to suggest the next line.]  [The order of the up to four options are random, and changes every time you begin again (or even go back to a previous frame).

To see the fifth you have to reload, then you may find this fifth option next time. The first panel is one of those with five options.]  [The fifth not shown above is: Let's see if BSD is any easier to install nowadays., see image with this option in the trivia section.]  [In the first days of the comic when it developed quickly, new options appeared only to later disappear. Gravity. Lots of it. is one of those lost options from the first panel. At one time there was also by mistake two versions of one of the other five mentioned above. But this was later deleted.

1692: Man Page,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1692:_Man_Page,bsd,"For even more info, see blarbl(2)(3) and birb(3ahhaha I'm kidding, just Google it like a normal person.","This comic shows a Unix manual page, i.e. a man page (hence the title), for a fictional program called ""blerp"". Unix man pages are meant to provide a brief reference on the usage of a command, not extended explanations with tutorials as may be found in many hardcopy product manuals. Unfortunately, some Unix commands tend to be very bloated and include lots of optional behavior that is often irrelevant to the original intent of the command and can be done much more easily using shell features like piping and redirection, and thus the manpage grows to explain all of the features. This example exaggerates the obscurity and terseness found in many man pages, making fun of the typical style of the genre.  It follows the prescribed format for a man page, with the following sections:  For comic effect, most of this particular man page is not meaningful, and sometimes doesn't obey the expected syntax.  The Synopsis section is supposed to be in a regex-like language called Wirth Syntax Notation, with structures like  But the two Synopsis lines given do not have valid Wirth syntax; they randomly mix objects and syntactic characters, and the brackets and braces are not properly nested or paired.  The Description section provides an unhelpful summary that could apply to almost any Unix command. Processing input files (or output of other commands in a pipeline) is a generic function for Unix shell tools, as is specifying their behaviour with command line arguments, environment variables and flags. The text leaves to the reader's imagination what the program actually does, and what behavior the various options modify, which gives maximum scope for humorous possibilities.  The options are in conventional alphabetical order, except that lower case is placed before upper case, and an em-dash is inserted between b and c.  Command-line options, also known as flags, are typed after the program's name to change how the program runs. For example, a user of blerp might type:  blerp -a -d -t -p ""AVIGNON""  According to the man page, this would run blerp in attack mode, piping its output to DEBUG.EXE, with tumble dry, and the true Pope set to ""AVIGNON"". In most cases, any number of flags can be used in any order, and flags can be followed by argument (such as ""AVIGNON"" in this example).  For a walkthrough of all possible flags see the table of flags below.  Below the flags there is a see also list with other ludicrous program names (blirb, blarb and blorp), each followed by a number in parentheses. This is a common way to refer to a command in Unix environments, where the number denotes the documentation section the program is found in. This serves to disambiguate man pages with the same name, in this instance those for the blerp command (section 1, ""General commnds"") and the blerp() C library function (section 3, ""C library functions"").  It is unknown which section the man page in this comic resides in. It looks like it could be in section 1, ""General commans"", which would make it self-referential. Section numbers only go up to 8, so blarb(51) is not a valid section number. The last blorp(501)(c)(3) is not a valid section number either, it is however a slightly covert reference to 501(c)(3) which is an organization that is tax-exempt.  Then follows a bug report site. www.inaturalist.org is a site working to extend biological research, and the exact address given, http://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47744-Hemiptera, points to the same page as http://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/Hemiptera. Hemiptera is the order classifying true bugs, making it a good place to report any biological bugs discovered while running a program (Like the bees found without using -b.) Insects got into some early computers, causing them to malfunction, and hence computer malfunctions are often called ""bugs"".  Finally there is a ""copyright"" line which references several variously open-source content licenses, which is a recurring theme on xkcd (see 225: Open Source). For instance, GPL references GNU General Public License and the (2) and (3+) refers to GPL 2 and GPL 3 or higher. CC refers to creative commons where BY is the type of license, 5.0 refers to the attribution and RV 41.0 refers to revision 41.0. However there were no higher attribution than 4.0 at the time of this comic's release. xkcd is released under CC BY-NC 2.5 as can be seen at the bottom of the xkcd   homepage. A few comics have been released under the CC-BY-SA license or 3.0. BSD refers to BSD licenses, another recurring theme in xkcd. ""Like Gecko"" is a reference to a web browser user-agent string; modern user-agent strings include a lot of text designed to allow browsers to masquerade as different browsers/renderers, and ""(like Gecko)"" is the standard text for a browser that wants to be treated as if it were Gecko while admitting, if you look closely, that it isn't really Gecko. This copyright line, which includes a lot of mashed-together text that might appear to match any of several different licenses, resembles a user agent string.  ""Or best offer"" is usually seen on a notice of a private sale, where it proclaims the intent to be flexible on asking price in the hope of expediting the sale, with a suggestion that the seller will sell to the highest bidder even if the offer is nowhere near the asking price. In the context of the comic, it suggest that the rights for the program are available for purchase by anyone who makes the ""best"" offer. Since the other licenses listed would allow free usage without incurring any royalty charge, it would be pointless to buy the rights to this program. It is possible to revoke the other licenses though. Perhaps the program's creator is suggesting the rights could be given to someone making him a different sort of offer, perhaps romantic or sexual?  In the title text there is a list with even more info, again with silly names like blarbl and birb. Again there are section numbers. While writing about birb, and without bothering to close the brackets around (3), the writer breaks off to laugh at the reader, telling them that he is kidding and suggesting that they just Google it like a normal person. The implication is that anyone trying to pick through a man page to find out what a program does is going the long way round, when it's much simpler to get Google to tell you.  Man pages were part of the subject of 293: RTFM, 912: Manual Override and 1343: Manuals and were mentioned in 434: xkcd Goes to the Airport and 456: Cautionary.",[A terminal screen; the background is black and the text is white.]
364: Responsible Behavior,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/364:_Responsible_Behavior,computer_security,Never bring tequila to a key-signing party.,"This New Year comic could play out after Cueball has returned from a New Year party the day before. (The next New Year day comic in 2008 was also related to a big party: 524: Party).  In order to send encrypted mail to people, you need to know their public key. You use this key to encrypt the email, and only they can read it (using their private key).  However, there is the problem of authentication: how do you know for certain that the key belongs to the person to whom you think it does?  It could be someone else masquerading as them, hoping for people to send them sensitive information.  They could decrypt and read your mail, and could even re-encrypt it using the genuine public key of the intended recipient, and then pass the message onto them, leaving both you and the recipient unaware of the interception. This is a type of man-in-the-middle attack.  One solution for this is that people sign each other's keys. It works like this: say you want to send an email to Bob, but you've never met him. You find his key online (they are stored on certain servers, like cryptographic phone books), but how can you be sure that it's really his? Well, turns out that you have a mutual friend Alice, and you have her public key and you know that it is hers. If Alice has signed Bob's key with her private key (which only she has access to), it means that she's certain that that really is Bob's key. So then you can be sure that Bob's key is genuine (since you have a common friend, Alice) and that your communications will be safe.  A key-signing party is simply a super-geeky party where people meet in real life so that they can be sure of people's identity, and then everyone signs everyone else's key. It's a good way to expand the web of trust. The joke here is that he has no idea who this girl is and yet he still signed her key. This is dangerous, because he is vouching for her identity. If he is mistaken, this could result in a serious loss of credibility on his part.   The humor lies in the juxtaposition of what you expect (that they had sex) and what is the case (they signed each other's key, also known as geek-sex).","[Cueball on phone.] Voice: Hey, I just got home from the party Cueball: The one with the IRC folks? Voice: Yeah. Cueball: How was it? Voice: Got too drunk. I screwed up, bad. Cueball: What happened? Voice: There was a girl. No idea who she was. Don't even know her name. I was too drunk to care. Cueball: And what, you slept with her? Voice: No. Voice: I signed her public key. Cueball: Shit, man."
565: Security Question,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/565:_Security_Question,computer_security,"Let's invite him to a party and play 'I never'. Okay, I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street. ...he's taking a drink!","Security questions are sensitive questions that allow a user to retrieve or reset his password if the password is lost or stolen. Because of this powerful function, security questions should be treated just as seriously as passwords. Typical security questions include ""What's your mother's maiden name?"" or ""What's your secondary school?"" and are intended to be easy for the user to answer but hard for anyone else to answer.  In this comic, however, the security question is deployed in a strange way, as the question ""Where are the bodies buried?"" assumes that one had buried bodies, hence had killed someone. The question turns out to be a ploy by the police, who were trying to bait Cueball into confessing his crime, as well as revealing the location of the incriminating evidence.  ""I never"" is a drinking game that somebody says ""I never did something"" to the others. If you never did it, you don't need to drink, otherwise, drink. Since he takes a drink for ""I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street"", the police have narrowed down the search area. The next statement in the game could be ""I never hid any bodies WEST of Central Avenue"" (or whatever road dividing the area), further localizing the bodies to a quarter of the original search area, in a Twenty Questions manner. Of course, by taking the drink Cueball also admits that he buried bodies, though this evidence would not likely be accepted by any court.","[Cueball sits at a computer.] Computer Screen: -Email Account Setup- To verify your identity, we need to ask you a question nobody else could answer.

792: Password Reuse,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/792:_Password_Reuse,computer_security,It'll be hilarious the first few times this happens.,"This comic has three layers: hacking, philosophy, and Google-satire.  It starts off on a practical level, with Black Hat describing to Cueball a devious social engineering scheme. It relies on the fact that people commonly reuse the same password on multiple websites, and tend to create accounts on new websites somewhat indiscriminately. Thus, one could create a simple Web service to collect users' usernames, email addresses, and passwords. Since many users will reuse this combination on other websites as well, the website owner can try to hack their accounts on other common sites, such as Amazon, PayPal or even people's banks, using the same login information.  In panel 7, the comic suddenly develops a philosophical and ethical bent. Black Hat reveals that he has already carried out step 1, through his numerous unprofitable Web services which he had been running for this very purpose. However, after successfully executing the hack, he realizes that he does not know what to do with all this power.  He reveals that he is already financially self-sufficient, and makes a point that money can't buy happiness once past that point, he even states that research has proven this. He could use his power to realize his sadistic pleasures of messing with people, but he's already a serial classhole and does not need this information to continue that trend.   If he had any beliefs or ideology, he could use this power to try to spread them. However, he reveals that ""since March of 1997"" he doesn't really believe in anything. This could possibly refer to the March 26, 1997 incident in San Diego, California, where 39 Heaven's Gate cultists committed mass suicide at their compound. It is a plausible explanation, since one of them was the brother of Nichelle Nichols (a Star Trek actress), so the event got a big resonance in nerd circles (and Randall often refers to Star Trek in xkcd). It's also possible that Black Hat was a sincere member of the cult, but the religion disbanded after the suicides, or that he orchestrated the cult. However, given Black Hat's strange behavior, it could be anything, even Bill Clinton banning federal funding for human cloning research. Maybe he will finally find a belief he wish to spread after his revelation in 1717: Pyramid Honey. This lack of a belief could also be a reference to the Phoenix Lights. While this event caused since to believe in extraterrestrials, it is possible that Black Hat's contrary nature is so ingrained into his personality that the event caused him to stop having beliefs or opinions of any kind.  The dilemma: Black Hat has cleverly executed a hack that has given him a lot of power, but he doesn't know what to do with it.   The last part of the comic now transitions to a satire on how Google has already gone through both the stages described above. It describes how all of Google's free services are simply a ploy to collect and control all the world's information, similar in concept but grander than the hack described in part 1. It satirizes the notion that behind Google's ""Don't be evil"" motto is actually an end-goal of using their powers eventually for evil.   However, just like Black Hat, once Google reaches the stage where they are able to capitalize on their powers, the Cueball-like head-executive finds that there is nothing evil left for them to desire, except (as Hairbun states) make even more money. As they already make a lot of money this ploy is moot, and anything remaining that they wish to do, such as hosting Call of Duty (CoD) tournaments, isn't evil at all.   In the end the secretary calls dibs on the TV in the lobby in order to play CoD4 on what (one can assume) is a large screen. The Cueball-like executive who wished to implement the evil plan in the first place facepalms when he realizes that Google just sucks at being evil.  In the title text, “The first few times this happens” may refer to the weekly CoD4 “tournament.” Alternatively, it could also mean the “first few times” a company decides to turn evil (but then has no idea how).  This comic was directly referenced in the title text of 1286: Encryptic.","[Black Hat is standing to the left behind Cueball, who is sitting in an office chair at his desk working on his computer.

970: The Important Field,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/970:_The_Important_Field,computer_security,"I hear in some places, you need to fill one form of ID to buy a gun, but two to pay for it by check. It's interesting to see who has what incentives to care about what mistakes.","It is very common that online input forms demand that one's email address is typed twice, and also quite common that pasting into the second field is disabled, so that there is no escape. If a form asks for some information that is really much more crucial, and this standard routine thoughtlessly isn't used for those fields too, it would comically seem that the form-makers consider your email address to be hideously important, maybe even more important than the location where a missile is programmed to land. In the comic, the impression is that it is less important that the wrong city is not accidentally wiped out, than that the boss knows who to blame afterwards.  The title text suggests a real world parallel to this. Randall has heard about differing priorities of identifying who is purchasing a firearm (the state/locality requires one form of identification) and ensuring the payment (the store requires two forms of ID, to properly document the person, in case the check is fake or is rejected by the bank). The point is that people often care a lot about money, but a gun in the wrong hands is a potential disaster bigger than a few hundred missing dollars.  This is the only comic so far to feature Green Hat. It appears that the green hat means that he is part of the military.","[Green Hat sitting at a computer.] Computer: Welcome to the missile launch interface! Click Computer: Enter the target's coordinates. Type Type Computer: Enter your email address for our records. Type Type Computer: Enter your email again, to ensure you typed it correctly."
153: Cryptography,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/153:_Cryptography,computer_security,"If you got a big keyspace, let me search it.","This comic refers to the study of cryptography. We can note the presence of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) logo in the lectern, an association that organizes the most important conferences in the cryptology field. Cueball, behind the lectern at the podium, is describing a proposed crypto system in which a computer program turns a very large number, called the ""key,"" and a message into an encrypted form that can only be read by using the same key, based on the model of a Feistel cipher. Part of any Feistel cipher is the ""round function,"" which determines how the key is applied to the original message; this is applied multiple times with a variety of tricks and techniques to ensure that the process can eventually be reversed. One common component of round functions is the S-box, a simple table that converts input bytes into output bytes, preferably in a way that doesn't correspond to any mathematical rules.  Here, the S-box would be implemented by doing the following (with the computer operation actually shown in the diagrams indicated in parentheses):  This would be run on each round of the cipher to further scramble the message for the next round. As the caption implies, the steps are based on a line from the Missy Elliott song Work It: ""I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it."" As with any encryption system, there must be a way to decrypt the cipher text. In Missy Elliott's song, the phrase ""I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it"" is repeatedly played backward, sounding like gibberish. In the same way, steps to a Feistel cipher-based algorithm are executed in reverse to obtain the original plain text from a cipher text.  The keyspace for a cryptographic algorithm is the number of possible keys the algorithm can possibly accept. For example, AES-256 has a keyspace of 2256 (roughly 1.1579209e+77) possible keys, simply because the algorithm specifies that each key is 256 bits wide. The title text is referring to ""searching a keyspace,"" which is to say, simply trying every key until you find one that works. (For reference, a computer would require roughly the energy of a billion billion supernovas to even count to 2256, let alone actually try each one.) The precise wording, ""If you got a big keyspace, let me search it"" is, of course, another reference to the same song: ""If you got a big **** let me search ya"" (The word ""penis"" is censored by the trumpeting of an elephant).  Cueball is banned from multiple conferences for similar pranks in 541: TED Talk. In response to 541, PyCon organizers jokingly announced that Randall Munroe was banned from PyCon 2009 due to ""last year's disgraceful keynote, 'Web Spiders vs. Red Spiders'."" They also said they instructed their volunteers to refuse admission to him and ""any stick figures who may attempt to register, particularly if they are wearing hats.""  Messages on the PyCon-Organizers mailing list show that this joke was intended to get Randall to come to PyCon: (The links will only work if you're subscribed to the mailing list.)","[Randall Munroe (drawn as Cueball) stands behind a lectern on a podium in front of a large conference audience (consisting of Cueball heads), with a poster hanging beside him.] Randall: My cryptosystem is like any Feistel cipher, except in the S-Boxes we simply take the bitstring down, flip it, and reverse it.  [The poster reads:]  Decryption  01101010     >>  00110101  [inverter symbol]  11001010  [crossed arrows]  01010011   [Caption below the crowd:] I've been barred from speaking at any major cryptography conferences ever since it became clear that all my algorithms were just thinly disguised Missy Elliott songs."
177: Alice and Bob,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/177:_Alice_and_Bob,computer_security,Yet one more reason I'm barred from speaking at crypto conferences.,"Any good cryptography presentation will include at least one story about Alice and Bob. They are the canonical ""protagonists"" of the crypto world, frequently used in illustrations to demonstrate how a cryptographic system works. (The names were mostly chosen to abbreviate to A and B, as well as being of different genders so that they can be distinguished by pronouns alone.)  Here, Randall casts the story in a different light. Instead of Alice and Bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private, Bob is actually having an affair with Alice, and his former partner, upset, cracked the encryption to see what the message contained. Nevertheless, the ""gossipy cryptographic protocol specs"" all took Alice's side (since the goal of any good crypto system is, of course, to succeed in this struggle).  The rest of the comic makes a few other allusions to cryptography:  Finally, in a twist ending, the girlfriend is revealed to be none other than Eve, the eavesdropper, who is also ubiquitous in Alice and Bob stories. Hell hath no fury, indeed.  The title text continues the theme of Randall getting barred from speaking at conferences due to his unusual take on certain topics.  To further spice things up, there are many other characters in the Alice/Bob canon, including Mallory, the malicious attacker, who wants to actually alter the message with nefarious intent; Craig, the cracker, who doesn't particularly care about the message but does care about the passwords used; Plod, a law enforcement officer attempting to access keys or data; and Chuck, a third party in the communication who secretly has a villainous intent.  Alice, Bob, and Eve are mentioned again in comic: 1323: Protocol","[Eve stands in the frame, talking to the reader.] Eve: I'm sure you've heard all about this sordid affair in those gossipy cryptographic protocol specs with those busybodies Schneier and Rivest, always taking Alice's side, always labeling me the attacker. Eve: Yes, it's true. I broke Bob's private key and extracted the text of her messages. But does anyone realize how much it hurt? Eve: He said it was nothing, but everything from the public-key authenticated signatures on the files to the lipstick heart smeared on the disk screamed ""Alice."" Eve: I didn't want to believe. Of course on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack. But I couldn't admit it until I saw it for myself. [Eve places her hands on her hips.] Eve: So before you so quickly label me a third party to the communication, just remember: I loved him first. We had something and she tore it away. She's the attacker, not me. Not Eve."
343: 1337: Part 3,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/343:_1337:_Part_3,computer_security,"I once asked an NSA guy whether they'd broken RSA. And I know I can trust him, because I asked if he was lying to me and he said no.","This is the third part of five in the ""1337"" series. The title 1337 is ""L-eet"", or ""elite"", using the Leet alphabet.  All comics in the series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  The comic is narrated by Cueball as seen in the previous comic, but that Cueball is not shown here, where the man drawn as Cueball is a real person:  Adrian Lamo is a hacker known for being a threat analyst and has penetrated many corporate networks. As far as we know, he has not penetrated any government networks, so helping Elaine physically break into the NSA would probably inspire second thoughts. The use of a rug to cross the barbed wire fence is likely a reference to a scene in Fight Club, where the same method is used to break into a liposuction clinic.  RSA is an encryption algorithm that allows decryption using public keys. No efficient method to break RSA is known. But if the NSA knew any such method, it would be unlikely for them to admit that. However, the NSA have paid RSA to put a backdoor into one of their encryption schemes.  Lawrence Lessig is a political activist focusing on copyright law and intellectual property, as well as a founding board member of Creative Commons.  Steve Jobs was the two-time CEO of Apple Inc. In partnership with Steve Wozniak he founded Apple. He oversaw Apple's return from near bankruptcy, the introduction of the original Macintosh, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. But in the 90s, most of this had not happened yet. The comic is implying that it was Elaine, in fact, who planted those ideas in Jobs' mind (while perching on his bedpost, a nearly-impossible physical task for even a relatively small and light human being - such a stance is often depicted for gargoyles or fictional vampires, the latter of which are associated with nocturnal bedroom-invasions like this).  The final panel is a pun on the Riot grrrls - Riot grrrl is an underground feminist punk rock movement. This metamorphosis in the hands of Randall into Riot Prrl - who presumably prefer to code in Perl. The real Riot Prrl are from Northampton and are into guerilla knitting.  The title text may refer to the urban legend that leads petty criminals to ask each other ""Are you a cop?"" the bottom line being that liars can lie about whether they're lying.","[Outside, Adrian Lamo is helping Elaine Roberts over a barbed wire fence.] It was the late 90's.

370: Redwall,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/370:_Redwall,computer_security,My Redwall/Jurassic Park crossover fanfic is almost complete!,"This comic references Brian Jacques' series of books, Redwall, which star sapient woodland animals in various high fantasy adventures.  The first panel shows the similarity between the story of Martin the Warrior (from the book Mossflower) and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The joke is that while Martin and Aragorn introduce themselves separately, they then go on to describe their particular story, which turns out to be exactly the same for both of them. Subsequently Martin jinxes Aragorn. Jinx is a common children's game, which is initiated by shouting ""Jinx"" after somebody speaks the same word or sentence at the same time as you. That person is then jinxed, with the usual rules dictating that they are then not permitted to speak until unjinxed by some specific action (usually somebody saying their name).  The second panel deals with the fact that Redwall mentions the name of Satan or The Devil 4 times while it never mentions God or Jesus. Randall then points out that people who protest against Harry Potter because of the series' witchcraft, should take note that Redwall explicitly mentions Satan although it has had little to no negative feedback from more conservative readers.  In the third panel, Randall comments on Redwall's often-used theme of critical messages being left in riddles throughout the Abbey for the occupants to find when they are in need. Randall suggests that he would use public-key cryptography to encode the messages, instead of the elaborate riddles used in the books (some of which are ridiculously easy, which doesn't exactly make for good security when dealing with sensitive information).  In the title text Randall jokes that he is making a crossover fan-fiction with Redwall and Jurassic Park.  Redwall was also referenced in 1688: Map Age Guide and 1722: Debugging.","Notes from reading Redwall books for the first time since childhood.  Some of this feels familiar. Aragorn: Hi, I'm Aragorn. Martin: I'm Martin. Aragorn and Martin: I'm here to reforge my broken sword so I can lead an army against the tyrant threatening my people. I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones. Martin: Jinx!  It startled me when characters mentioned Satan. Redwall: ""By Satan's whiskers..."" Redwall mentions God/Jesus 0 times. Redwall mentions Satan/The Devil 4 times. (Harry Potter protesters, take note.)  Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It's silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them. I would do things differently. Matthias: The inscription is a message from Martin! Brother Methuselah: What does it say? Matthias: Hang on, it's encrypted with my public key."
424: Security Holes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/424:_Security_Holes,computer_security,True story: I had to try several times to upload this comic because my ssh key was blacklisted.,"The ""Debian-OpenSSL fiasco"" was a major security problem discovered in the Debian Linux distribution and its version of the cryptographic library called OpenSSL. With just a tiny change in the software, which was intended to have no effect on security, its random number generator was completely crippled, as was the security of all cryptographic keys generated by the system. The problem was created when a Debian developer removed one line of code which was crucial, even though it could seem like it did nothing useful. More detail about the fiasco: Crippling Crypto: The Debian OpenSSL Debacle, Debian's information page about the problem.  The title text refers also to this issue: After the security problem was found, all cryptographic keys generated or used on the broken operating system needed to be replaced. Many systems introduced special checks for such weak keys, adding the keys to blacklists, thereby preventing their use and forcing users to create new keys. Randall claims he was affected by that when uploading this comic to the server.  The comics on the left presents Cueball as a programmer who, on a whim, removes pieces of code (commenting out the code by prepending the line with two slashes), presumably thinking they are not necessary. The first removed line, MD_update(&m, buf, j); is the exact piece of code which was removed in the Debian fiasco. The next panels show him commenting out fictitious lines of code apparently preventing bad things from happening.  The other part of the comic lists ""security problems"" which were allegedly discovered in other Linux variants afterwards:  Cryptographic software in Fedora Core was allegedly not secure against toy decoder rings.   Xandros (used in Asus Eee PC netbooks) gave superuser privileges to anybody ""if asked in a stern voice"". This is likely a reference to fact that the preinstalled Xandros OS did not require a password for root privileges by default.  Gentoo would succumb to flattery, which may be a reference to Gentoo's notorious difficulty to manage. Any user who is capable of understanding it, might have a large ego, and therefore be susceptible to flattery.  OLPC OS could have been attacked using Jeff Goldblum's laptop computer, which refers to a scene in the Independence Day movie, where Jeff Goldblum's character was able to hack into an alien spaceship using his Apple PowerBook computer - which is a topic of great contempt by geeks who point to the absurdity of such a construction.  Slackware gave superuser privileges to anybody who ""says Elvish word for 'friend'"", which refers to a scene in The Lord of the Rings, where the entrance door to Moria could have been opened using a password mellon, the Elvish word for ""friend"", as indicated on the door itself.  And Ubuntu, which is another Linux distribution, was allegedly found to be actually Windows Vista, the latest version of Microsoft Windows at this time in 2008. This may be a reference to Ubuntu being developed with non-advanced users in mind, with many fail-safes and additional features being turned on by default, which had more in common with Windows than any other Linux-based operating system at the time.","[Cueball sitting at computer.] Cueball: I'll just comment out these lines...  // MD_update(&m, buf, j);  // do_not_crash();  // prevent_911();  In the rush to clean up the debian-openssl fiasco, a number of other major security holes have been uncovered:    Affected system   Security problem   Fedora Core   Vulnerable to certain decoder rings   Xandros (EEE PC)   Gives root access if asked in a stern voice   Gentoo   Vulnerable to flattery   OLPC OS   Vulnerable to Jeff Goldblum's Powerbook   Slackware   Gives root access if user says Elvish word for ""friend""   Ubuntu   Turns out distro is actually just Windows Vista with a few custom Themes"

463: Voting Machines,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/463:_Voting_Machines,computer_security,"And that's *another* crypto conference I've been kicked out of. C'mon, it's a great analogy!","In the 2008 Ohio primary elections, there were numerous problems with electronic voting machines, which eventually required many districts to revert to pen and paper. Premier Election Solutions, the company that handled the machines, blamed these problems on McAfee anti-virus software.  It is not uncommon to see computer software contract stipulating that the vendor will warrant that software and systems delivered will not contain any viruses or malicious code — a knee-jerk reaction to this is for novice management to include virus-scanning software for systems which otherwise are closed. From a computer programming standpoint, having anti-virus software on an electronic voting machine doesn't make sense because the machine shouldn't be accessing the Internet in a way that would leave it open to virus attacks. While there are a lot of ways that viruses can propagate, ultimately the computer still has to download an executable file and run it, which is something that no election machine should do in normal operation. Hence the question is whether the voting machine manufacturer has taken the proper precaution preventing any external access.   Ideally, voting machines (as well as ATMs and other single-purpose appliances) should be embedded systems, incapable of doing the things that might necessitate anti-virus software. However, in practice such devices are more commonly built as application programs running on ordinary Windows PCs (inside of custom-shaped cases), and they download software updates over the internet.  The comic makes an analogy to a teacher who reassures you that he always wears a condom when teaching. While a condom could be considered ""protection"", and therefore a good thing, common sense dictates that teachers should never end up in a situation where wearing a condom in school would be useful; this parallels the idea that while security in the form of anti-virus software on voting machines could also be considered protection and a good thing, it should never be required. The comment is more likely to make people worried about why the condom is there and what purpose it's serving. Similarly, informed people might worry why a voting machine is connecting to the internet.  In panel one, both the facepalm and ""You're doing it wrong"" are Internet memes, used to mock someone who made a foolish mistake.  The title text refers to 153: Cryptography.","Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold) has blamed Ohio voting machine errors on problems with the machines' McAfee antivirus software.  [Cueball is sitting at a computer, facepalming.] Cueball: Wait. ""Antivirus software""? On voting machines? You're doing it wrong.  [Cueball's friend enters the frame and speaks to Cueball.] Friend: Why? Security is good, right? Cueball: Of course. But, well—  Cueball: Imagine you're at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching.  Friend: Ah. Strictly speaking, it's better than the alternative— Cueball: —Yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong."
504: Legal Hacks,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/504:_Legal_Hacks,computer_security,It's totally a reasonable modern analogue. Jefferson would have been all about crypto.,"Megan notices that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is blocking access to some webpages. Cueball is thankful that cryptography offers a way around such censorship.   Encryption, sometimes called ""cryptography,"" or ""crypto"" for short, is the art of transmitting messages that can only be read by the intended receiver(s) by using mathematical techniques to conceal (""encrypt"") the data in the message. One common and effective way to encrypt messages is the RSA algorithm, which is based on the difficulty of integer factorization for products of two prime numbers.  Being able to share unbreakable codes and decrypt other people's codes gives countries a military advantage - for example, in World War II, the Americans and British were often able to figure out where a German attack would be coming and send reinforcements there, because they had cracked the German codes. Because of this, the United States government initially tried to keep the mathematical details of strong encryption algorithms (including RSA) inside the country by classifying the algorithms as a weapon. It is a crime to share certain kinds of weapons technology with other countries without permission. Amateur and professional cryptographers, angry about the attempt to restrict their work, lobbied the government to change the rule and stop treating cryptography as a weapon, in part so that they could continue to collaborate with colleagues overseas, and in part because they wanted the ability to pass secret messages that the government could not easily decrypt. The export restrictions were gradually loosened and would have mostly been lifted by the year 2000.  In the comic, Megan makes the provocative and counter-intuitive point that perhaps the cryptographic community could have best ensured easy access to the RSA technique by *allowing* the government to treat RSA as a weapon, and then, once everyone is certain that RSA is a weapon, invoking the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, commonly known as the ""right to bear arms"" amendment (that is, the right to own and use weapons). In other words, if RSA were a weapon, it would be granted constitutional protections. This interpretation is likely a reference to the exceptionally strong antipathy towards arms control in the Southern United States (and not a whole lot weaker in most areas of the Northern and Western states).  Any attempts made by the government to restrict distribution or ownership of firearms (even those which are very similar to military-grade weapons) are typically countered very aggressive opposition from pro-gun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association. These political forces have made most gun restrictions politically untenable.  Megan is likely suggesting that classifying RSA as a weapon would gain the crypto community very powerful and unlikely political allies; on the flip side, if the government had already ruled it a weapon that needed to be restricted for national security purposes, it could easily invoke the same clauses that allows it to restrict actual military-grade hardware such as automatic weapons, explosives and chemical or biological weapons). Megan may also be hinting that, in the future, the US government might try to restrict access to encryption algorithms, making it necessary for cryptographers to defend their rights to them.  Cueball is surprised and impressed by this point, and pauses to contemplate Megan's strategy.  The title text claims that this is a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution, because cryptography (a modern weapon) is analogous to muskets and cannons (the weaponry in use in the 1780s, when the Second Amendment was drafted). As evidence for the analogy, the title text points out that Jefferson would have been a big fan of cryptography, which is plausible, because President Thomas Jefferson (the 3rd President of the United States) was an amateur scientist who enjoyed studying a very wide variety of fields (in fact, he invented the Jefferson disk, an encryption device that was quite advanced for its time). The point is somewhat facetious, because it is hard to imagine a modern technique that Jefferson would not ""be totally into."" Also, the mere assertion that an early President would have been a fan of a technique is not very good evidence that the technique would be legally permitted by a particular Amendment.","[Megan sits at her computer, Cueball standing behind her.] Megan: Another ISP's filtering content. Cueball: Thank God for Crypto.  [Cueball stands alone; Megan is presumably off-panel left.] Cueball: It wasn't that long ago that RSA was illegal to export. Classified a munition.  [Megan, sitting in her chair, is looking back towards Cueball, presumably off-panel right.] Megan: You know, I think the crypto community took the wrong side in that fight. We should've lobbied to keep it counted as a weapon. Cueball: Why?  [She is now turned around in the chair looking at Cueball, who is in-panel again.] Megan: Once they get complacent, we break out the second amendment. [Cueball has his hand on his chin, contemplatively.] Cueball: ...Damn."
538: Security,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/538:_Security,computer_security,"Actual actual reality: nobody cares about his secrets. (Also, I would be hard-pressed to find that wrench for $5.)","The ""crypto nerd"" would be concerned with strongly encrypting data on their personal machine. This would conceivably come in handy when ""villains"" attempt to steal information on his computer. The crypto nerd imagines that due to his advanced encryption, the crackers will be ultimately defeated. Randall suggests that in the real world, people with the desire to access this information would simply use torture to coerce the nerd to give them the password. Both panels also reference the amount of money used to access the data. In the first the villain is willing to use millions of dollars to construct a super computer, while in the second, he simply uses a $5 wrench. The comic effectively states, completely accurately, that the weakest part of computer security is not the computer, but the user.  RSA is a commonly used, public key encryption method. Current standards typically use 1024, 2048, and (more recently) 4096 bit keys. These encryption methods are not yet (feasibly) breakable. A 4096-bit key will remain unbreakable for the foreseeable future.  The title text pokes fun at typical users, who do not have data that would be worth anything to anyone but themselves. Therefore, it is unlikely that the above situation would ever occur. Additionally, the wrench used in the second panel is large, and presumably more than the $5 referenced by the thug.","A Crypto nerd's imagination: [Cueball is holding a laptop, and his friend is examining it.] Cueball: His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a million-dollar cluster to crack it. Friend: No good! It's 4096-bit RSA! Cueball: Blast! Our evil plan is foiled!  What would actually happen: [Cueball is holding a piece of paper and giving his friend a wrench.] Cueball: His laptop's encrypted.

593: Voynich Manuscript,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/593:_Voynich_Manuscript,computer_security,"Wait, is that the ORIGINAL voynich manuscript? Where did you GET that? Wanna try playing a round of Druids and Dicotyledons?","The Voynich manuscript is a very detailed book written in an unknown script, describing plants and recipes, most of which lack a real-world analogue. Over the past few decades, linguists and cryptographers have unsuccessfully attempted to decode the book. A cut out from the book is depicted in the first frame (real or similar).  Tabletop role-playing games (such as Dungeons and Dragons) are fantasy games with extremely detailed descriptions of fantastical worlds. The invented language is probably a reference to The Lord of the Rings in which author J. R. R. Tolkien invented several languages of which Sindarin (Grey elvish), and Quenya (High elvish), are the most famous.  After being shown the manuscript for the first time by Megan, Cueball argues that it should be obvious that it's just an ancient role-playing-game rulebook, since the human tendency to invent fantastical worlds must have also existed in the past. That it is this obvious was again stated when the manuscript was referenced in 1501: Mysteries.  In the last panel the book is used, 500 years ago, to play a game  similar to Dungeons and Dragons. They speak in a somewhat outdated English. The reference to the real plant Wolfsbane could also be a reference to another invented world, as it is memorably mentioned in the first book of the Harry Potter series.  After concluding this, a shocked Cueball then asks in the title text how Megan got her hands on the original manuscript (which is in the Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library). He then unexpectedly goes on to suggest the prosaic activity of playing Druids and Dicotyledons, assuming such a game could be defined by the manuscript.","[Weird root vegetables surround a strange script.]  [Megan holding up book to Cueball.] Megan: This is the Voynich manuscript— a book, allegedly 500 years old, written in an unrecognized script. It's some kind of visual encyclopedia of imaginary plants and undeciphered ""recipes"".  [Megan points while Cueball opens the book.] Megan: It could be a hoax, a lost language, a cipher, an alien text, glossolatia — no one knows. Cueball: No one? But it's obvious.  [Megan continues to talk. Cueball holds the now closed book.] Megan: ... Obvious? Linguists and cryptographers have been stumped for decades. Cueball: They forget. Human nature doesn't change.  [Close up of Megan and Cueball - the book is off panel.] Cueball: Just imagine someone found a book from our time, full of lists, illustrations, tables, and long, dry descriptions of nonexistent worlds written in an invented language. What have they found? Megan: ...Dear Lord. It is obvious.  [Three people are standing around pawns and a die. One is holding a sheet of paper, another is holding a book, the third is holding a scythe. At the top of the panel there is a frame with the following text:] 500 Years Earlier: Person #1: Forsooth!

1039: RuBisCO,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1039:_RuBisCO,computer_security,Bruce Schneier believes safewords are fundamentally insecure and recommends that you ask your partner to stop via public key signature.,"Safe words are designated words for sexual play which are meant to be called if one partner is uncomfortable with the way things are proceeding as alternatives to simply saying ""no"" or ""stop"", which may be used to express playacted reluctance by a submissive partner who actually wants to continue. Calling the pre-chosen ""safe word"" would be a sign to stop. To prevent accidental usage, people generally pick words that they wouldn't normally use. In the case of this comic, the characters are chemists, and the uncommon word they happen to have chosen is Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, also known as RuBisCO (which actually isn't a very uncommon word in the scientific world, as it's the most abundant protein on earth, but it would be uncommon to use the full word). However, the length of the word makes it impractical for a safe word, as it would take too long to say; indeed, using the shorter form ""RuBisCO"" would normally be a fine safe word.  The title text mentions Bruce Schneier, a computer security professional, and public keys which is the publicly known half of public-key cryptography, which uses two mathematically linked keys to decrypt information. The joke is that Schneier considers safewords as a type of security and thus believes they are not safe enough and recommend the key signature. However, whereas it takes a long time to say RuBisCO in full during your submission, it would be impossible to use any public keys to stop your partner.","[Person in background (out-of-frame) screams out this word over all 3 panels.]  Sub: RIBULOSEBISPH..  Sub: ...OSPHATECARBOXYL...  Sub: ...ASEOXYGENASE! Dom: Oh, Sorry! Megan: Man, chemists pick the worst safewords."
1181: PGP,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1181:_PGP,computer_security,"If you want to be extra safe, check that there's a big block of jumbled characters at the bottom.","PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a program which can be used to encrypt and/or sign data, including messages sent as emails. Encrypting means encoding data in a way that requires a secret key to decrypt and read; signing means that there is a code included in the data which can be used to verify the identify of the sender and that the data has not been altered in transit.  In the case of the email in this comic, it has only been signed; not encrypted (hence, the top of the first line of text can be seen and is legible in normal English). This is more common than encryption, as reading an encrypted message would require the recipient to already be a PGP user. In fact, the use of PGP even to sign email messages is so rare that most people have probably never seen a signed message. Because a signed email is so rare, and because it is already legible and unencrypted, Randall is making the tongue-in-cheek observation that few users, technical or otherwise, actually know how to use the signature to verify the authenticity of the sender using the PGP signature, and that such users can safely assume that since there is a signature, that is good enough evidence that the message is authentic. Further, because PGP signatures are so rare and probably ignored by most recipients, he suggests one would not expect anyone to even bother creating a false PGP signature; therefore the mere existence of a PGP header would suggest authenticity.  The title text extends the joke by suggesting you confirm there's a bunch of random characters in the footer (this is the actual signature that PGP generates which can be used to verify the authenticity of the email). Again, Randall is humorously suggesting that the existence of the block is itself sure evidence of authenticity.","How to use PGP to verify that an email is authentic: Look for this text at the top [In mail header, light grey.] Reply [Highlighted, with arrow pointing to it from the text ""Look for this text at the top"" above.] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- [In mail message, light grey.] HASH: SHA256 Hey, First of all, thanks for taking care of  [After mail message.] If it's there, the email is probably fine"
1269: Privacy Opinions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1269:_Privacy_Opinions,computer_security,I'm the Philosopher until someone hands me a burrito.,"According to the title, the comic is about opinions on internet privacy in general. Six positions are offered as options. Four of the positions are tagged negatively by the author by their subtitles alone: the Crypto Nut, the Conspiracist, the Nihilist, and the Exhibitionist, all of which have negative valences in contemporary English. That the viewer is encouraged to identify negatively with these four positions is further encouraged by the content of the panels, as those characters are depicted either as having such boring lives that they have no need for privacy (the Crypto Nut, the Nihilist), or as being crazy (the Conspiracist, the Exhibitionist).  A fifth position, the Philosopher, is tagged somewhat ambivalently by the author: Megan, or possibly a look-alike, is depicted as boring her interlocutor, yet in the title text, the author admits that he is usually the Philosopher. Also, ""Philosopher"" in vernacular English is neutrally valenced, potentially having the ability to expound either wisdom (sophia) or sophistry. It is also a synonym for Sage, the sixth position. As the author condones his own movement from Philosopher to Sage, he thus indicates that the Philosopher is to be viewed negatively, even if it is a tempting position to hold.  The title of the sixth position, the ""Sage"", is positively valenced in contemporary English, and the author in the title text states that once he obtains a ""burrito"" – i.e., a ""real"" thing, he switches from the Philosopher to the Sage. The internal evidence presented thus far therefore is entirely consistent; the author encourages the reader to identify with the Sage. However, the choice of Beret Guy to represent the Sage undercuts this somewhat as Beret Guy is frequently seen as bizarrely disconnected from reality in a way that is maladaptive (e.g. 1030: Keyed) and overly obsessed with food to the point of creating trouble and potential self-harm (e.g. 452: Mission).  By presenting five negatively tagged positions followed by a positively tagged sixth and final one, the author follows a rhetorical commonplace of listing and refuting a number of positions one by one, concluding with the favored and best one, which is not refuted and should be accepted both on its own merits and by virtue of being the last one standing. The comic therefore implies that no other (significant) positions exist.  Having completed the rhetorical analysis of the comic, we are now in a position to understand the meaning of ""Internet Privacy"".  Panels #3 and 5 directly reference the American NSA. Panel #5's ""exhibitionist"" also references Google, but the characters in the panel appear to be NSA agents (one wears an official cap and they are viewing the exhibitionist on an official, government-looking monitor). Likewise, the focus of the ""Nihilist"" is that the joke is on the people who gather the data, rather than those who are subsequently able to make use of it (such as Facebook's users rather than ""Facebook"" itself; i.e., Facebook's employees and, by extension, its advertisers). The content of the actual data is only mentioned in panels #2, 4, and 5, and in each panel, it is suggested that it is meaningless or trivial. The Sage underscores the notion that any data known about him does not bother him, and therefore must be meaningless or trivial. The reader is thus encouraged to believe that it does not actually matter whether others discover personal data about him/her.  The comic is therefore what social theorists call reductive, because it reduces the range of possibilities of ""Opinions on Internet Privacy"" to an artificially and simplistically narrow subset; in this case, individuals concerned with government or corporate agencies using data that they have gathered on individuals, and the futility of worrying about such things. The comic does not admit the possibility of other ""opinions on internet privacy"" – namely, that individuals might have legitimate concerns with governmental or corporate uses of their data, let alone other individuals' access to data that is assembled and distributed by corporations such as Facebook. The comic likewise does not consider the possibility of individuals having more interesting lives than the characters depicted, and therefore very real concerns about their privacy due to the activities that they engage in that are potentially more career limiting (should they be discovered) than obsessing about cryptography or eating a burrito.  The comic is ""functionally"" reductive, as opposed to ""intentionally"" reductive, because the reduction is the function or effect of the comic for readers who read it straightforwardly. There is not enough internal evidence in the comic to maintain that the author intentionally excluded other viable opinions on internet privacy; it could be that they are just not on his radar. For example, we do not have enough information in the comic to claim that the author is against civil rights; it could be simply that he doesn't often think about them. Likewise, it would exceed the evidence of the comic to claim that the author believes that schoolteachers who use the internet to facilitate legal but frowned-upon sexual behaviors should lose their jobs if they are found out due to internet privacy breaches; it could be that the author simply hasn't bothered to worry about these matters if they don't affect him personally. This adjudication – whether the comic is ""intentionally"" reductive or not – may only be made on the basis of external evidence; that is, data known about the author from sources beyond this comic.  An alternative interpretation of the title text is that it is not Randall speaking his own opinion, but instead represents Beret Guy's (i.e. the ""Sage's"") perspective. Randall may indeed have some concern with internet privacy, which would be consistent with the views on open-source security expressed in 463: Voting Machines, for example. In other cases, such as 1490: Atoms and 1419: On the Phone, the title text has been used as additional, farcical statements made by characters in the strip, rather than as Randall expressing his own views. Under this interpretation, Beret Guy would be prone to philosophizing about security, but then be easily distracted by a burrito; this is consistent with Beret Guy's general behavior.  Additional observations about the comic follow.  The release of the comic on this date could be to coincide with the premiere of South Park's 17th season on the same date, which starts with an episode (Let Go, Let Gov) in which Cartman discovers that the NSA has been spying on him.  The title text is to suggest that he enjoys burritos so much that being handed one even while philosophizing (his natural state) would stop him in his tracks to eat the burrito, thus becoming a pseudo-sage concerned only with the burrito at the exclusion of the topic of internet security. The burrito is later mentioned as a way to stay connected to the real word (compared to the world of art) in 1496: Art Project.","Opinions on Internet Privacy The Philosopher: Megan: ""Privacy"" is an impractical way to think about data in a digital world so unlike the one in which our soci-- Ponytail:  So bored.   The Crypto Nut: Cueball: My data is safe behind six layers of symmetric and public-key algorithms. Friend: What data is it? Cueball: Mostly me emailing with people about cryptography.  The Conspiracist: Cueball talks to Megan. Cueball: These leaks are just the tip of the iceberg. There's a warehouse in Utah where the NSA has the entire iceberg. I don't know how they got it there.  The Nihilist: Megan: Joke's on them, gathering all this data on me as if anything I do means anything.  The Exhibitionist: Cueball is watching a surveillance console, Officer Ponytail stands behind him. Console: Mmmm, I sure hope the NSA isn't watching me bite into these juicy strawberries!! Oops, I dripped some on my shirt! Better take it off. Google, are you there? Google, this lotion feels soooo good. Cueball: Um.  The Sage: Beret Guy and Cueball sitting at a table. Beret Guy: I don't know or care what data anyone has about me. Data is imaginary. This burrito is real."
1286: Encryptic,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1286:_Encryptic,computer_security,It was bound to happen eventually. This data theft will enable almost limitless [xkcd.com/792]-style password reuse attacks in the coming weeks. There's only one group that comes out of this looking smart: Everyone who pirated Photoshop.,"Web sites and other computers that authenticate users via passwords need to be able to know if the user typed in the right password. But storing the password itself on the computer has been known to be unnecessarily risky since the publication of Password Security: A Case History in 1978. In that paper, Robert Morris and Ken Thompson demonstrated the practice of using a slow, cryptographically-secure one-way hash function, so that even if the password file is stolen, it will be very hard to figure out what the passwords are, so long as the passwords themselves are suitably complex. They also pioneered the use of a ""salt"" which makes each password hash completely different even if two users use the same password. See A tour of password questions and answers for background on salts and suitably slow hash functions.  Adobe, however, ignored these well-known principles, and instead stored over a hundred million passwords in a reversibly encrypted way, using a terrible choice of encryption methods which exposes a great deal of information about the passwords, and does not involve a salt. This password database was recently obtained by someone and released on the Internet.  In particular, Adobe used Triple DES, an older encryption algorithm which can still be relatively secure when properly used, but they used it improperly. It works on 64-bit (8 character) blocks. Assuming that the passwords are stored in plain ASCII, this means that a sequence of 8 characters in a password which starts on a character position which is a multiple of eight is always encrypted to the same result. Therefore, two passwords starting with ""12345678"" would start with the same block after being encrypted. Furthermore, this means that you can actually get a very good idea of the length of the password since anything with only one block is a password with length between 1 and 8 characters, and having two blocks implies it has between 9 and 16 characters, etc.  Adobe also stored hints users created for their passwords. That means that an attacker knows not only if the same 8 characters are used for multiple passwords but also has some hints for guessing them. That means that common password portions should be easy to recover and that any user may be ""compromised"" by someone else using a part of the same password and providing a good hint. As an example, a password having three hints ""Big Apple"", ""Twin Towers"" and ""If you can make it there"" is probably ""New York"" or a simple variation on that. The weakness here is that no decryption and therefore no hard cracking has to take place, you just group the passwords by their encrypted blocks and try to solve them like a crossword puzzle. These weaknesses have already been used to presumably identify a password used by Edward Snowden, as discussed at 7 Habits of Highly Effective Hackers: Can someone be targeted using the Adobe breach?.  The examples are not taken from the actual leaked file, since that uses a different format, and the examples are evidently cleverly crafted to make a nice crossword-like puzzle, which can be solved as shown in the Passwords section below.  As mentioned on http://filosottile.github.io/analyzing-the-adobe-leaked-passwords/ the data in the comic isn't real and contains a hidden message. If the ""user password"" hashes are Base64 encoded, they read:  More readable:  E.g., with the initial unique hash blocks: python -c ""print '4e18acc1ab27a2d6a0a2876eb1ea1fca'.decode('hex_codec').encode('base64')""  The last letter ""r"" is not fully encoded in the data shown, but any letter from ""g"" to ""v"" produces the same binary data.  The title text makes a reference to a previous comic: Black Hat's trouble with what to do with stolen passwords. It also states that users of pirated Photoshop are the winners here. This is because in order to make Photoshop pirate-able, it was modified (cracked) by removing the requirement for registration so their passwords were not sent to Adobe and therefore are not present in the leaked file.  Soon after this comic was published, the most common 1000 passwords were actually compiled into a set of 10 interactive online crosswords, inspired by the comic.  The title itself is a reference to cryptic crosswords.  Note that characters in the passwords could be upper or lower case, and they may involve common substitutions like ""0"" (number zero) for ""O"" (letter O); therefore, the clues cannot guarantee that the answer shown here is precisely correct. Nevertheless, we have plenty of information for a brute force attack.","Hackers recently leaked 153 million Adobe user emails, encrypted passwords, and password hints. Adobe encrypted the passwords improperly, misusing block-mode 3DES. The result is something wonderful:  The greatest crossword puzzle in the history of the world"
1323: Protocol,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1323:_Protocol,computer_security,"Changing the names would be easier, but if you're not comfortable lying, try only making friends with people named Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.","Alice, Bob, and Eve are role names traditionally used in describing cryptographic protocols. Rather than talking about ""Person A"", ""Person B"", ""Person C"", names beginning with each letter are used instead, and giving them different genders let pronouns be used to shorten discussions. For example: ""Person A sends Person B a message encoded with Person B's public key"" is much easier to parse when written as ""Alice sends Bob a message encoded with his public key."" Eve is short for ""eavesdropper"" - a person trying to find out what's being said in the conversations between the other people. The classic situation involves Alice wanting to send a secret message to Bob, while Eve (the eavesdropper), attempts to read the message, ideally without Alice or Bob ever finding out. Additional participants such as Carol (Person C) can be added if necessary. The list of names has become very standardised over time as described at Alice and Bob.  The joke here is that any computer scientist, hearing the names used, will think that they are listening to a cryptography problem. By changing the names in a story to these role names, you can induce them to listen carefully to boring stories. The fewer the interesting details, the more it sounds like a general problem, so very boring stories are actually the easiest.  The title text shows a more radical approach to the problem, for people who do not feel comfortable about lying. In this approach, you only make friends with people who have the appropriate names already.  The comic title also can be interpreted in two ways. First, the computer scientist thinks the conversation is about an encryption protocol. Second, the way the conversation is carried resembles a protocol used by many data communication systems, where one side sends data while the other sends back an acknowledgement upon receiving the data. In this case, the data are the lines of the boring story.  In comic 177: Alice and Bob these names are used in the same context. Instead of Alice and Bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private, Bob is actually having an affair with Alice. Eve —his former partner— cracked the encryption to see what the message contained. Thus, this comic seems to continue the Alice/Bob romance, jealous-Eve plot, with Eve apparently confronting Alice over her text message to Bob.","[Cueball is telling a story to a Computer Scientist who is seated at his desk.] Cueball: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere. Computer Scientist: Uh huh. Cueball: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place. Computer Scientist: With you so far. Cueball: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet. Computer Scientist: Yeah? CAPTION: I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story."
1553: Public Key,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1553:_Public_Key,computer_security,"I guess I should be signing stuff, but I've never been sure what to sign. Maybe if I post my private key, I can crowdsource my decisions about what to sign.","In Public-key cryptography, two keys are generated for a user. The public key can be used to encrypt messages, but not decrypt them. The private key is necessary for decryption, and as its name implies, is meant to be used solely by the user.  Since the public key is initially designated to be shared, anyone who has that key can send the user an encrypted message that only he or she can decrypt. Cueball has been following this rule, but he notices that it appears nobody has ever used his public key for anything. He contemplates sharing his private key, which he believes would generate more interest in him personally. However, he appears to overlook the fact that doing so would allow anyone to decrypt messages sent to him, thus defeating the entire purpose of encryption.  The title text refers to another feature of Public-key cryptography: In addition to assuring that certain messages can only be read by a specific key owner, it can also assure that certain messages could only have been written by a specific key owner, by ""signing"" it using the private key. Anyone can read a signed message, but readers with the public key can then verify that the owner of the private key wrote (or at least signed) the message, rather than someone pretending to be the owner. If Cueball published his private key, then anybody could sign any message as him, effectively impersonating him and also defeating the purpose of encryption.  Crowdsourcing is the term used for delegating work or tasks to a largely volunteered and uncontrolled set of people on the Internet.  It is similar in concept to outsourcing, in which work is delegated to an external source of labor, typically a company in a foreign country. Famous instances of crowdsourcing include reCAPTCHA (in which users both verify they are human and help digitize words and phrases in books that digitization software cannot understand) and a farm in the UK in which ordinary Internet users make decisions about how the farm is run.  In Cueball's case, delegating decisions about his contracts and spending to the Internet is not likely to be a wise choice.  When Cueball first created the key pair, he imagined it would be something he used from time to time, for reading messages only intended for him or for sending ""signed"" messages.  Since nothing of the sort happened, he imagines releasing both keys might cause some activity, and at this point he is happier with a ""bad"" outcome than with a boring one.  Randall previously ironically mentioned a public key in 370: Redwall.","[In the first panel, Cueball is sitting in a chair and is using a laptop.] Cueball (thinking): I've been posting my public key for 15 years now, but no one has ever asked me for it or used it for anything as far as I can tell.  [This is followed by two beat panels where Cueball just sits there. doing nothing, not even thinking.]  [In the final panel he again uses his laptop and thinks.] Cueball (thinking): Maybe I should try posting my private key instead."
1808: Hacking,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1808:_Hacking,computer_security,"The dump also contains a list of millions of prime factors, a 0-day Tamagotchi exploit, and a technique for getting gcc and bash to execute arbitrary code.","This comic is referencing an incident on the day before this comic was released, March 7, 2017, in which WikiLeaks exposed thousands of hacking exploits (thus the title) and programs from the CIA (see for instance this article: WikiLeaks Just Dumped a Mega-Trove of CIA Hacking Secrets). Many of the tools that were in the leak were similar to publicly available tools, or not entirely unexpected, with several coming from sites such as StackOverflow and Reddit.  The main joke in this comic refers to the common practice of adding spaces between parts of an email address when publishing them on websites.  For example, ""[email protected]"" may be written as ""john dot doe at example dot org"".  The purported goal of doing this is to thwart page scraping bots from harvesting the correct email addresses and prevent them from becoming the target of spam or being sold as address lists for email marketers.    In this comic, Ponytail tells Cueball that the CIA has a tool which can delete such spaces. Such a tool can fix the space and most likely convert the words ""dot"" and ""at"" into their respective symbols. This will overcome the problems faced by harvesting tools, and make these email addresses more prone to receive spam.   Cueball appears shocked to hear this news, but given the caption below, stating that this was one of the less dramatic revelations from the CIA hacking dump, this is likely sarcasm by Cueball (and Randall). In fact, it is quite simple to devise a program which detects and converts/removes such spaces; it's naive to believe that one can prevent e-mail addresses from being harvested just by writing the addresses with space or omitting @ etc. Some people might not realize that he's being sarcastic, though, and that misunderstanding might be part of the joke.  The title text lists three other undramatic (fictitious) hacking exploits which sound more interesting, but are still more or less useless, and certainly not dramatic news. They are:",[Ponytail is writing on her laptop at her desk while Cueball looks over her shoulder.] Ponytail: You know how sometimes people put a space in their email address to make it harder to harvest? Cueball: Yeah? Ponytail: They have a tool that can delete the space! Cueball: Oh my god.  [Caption below the panel:] Less-dramatic revelations from the CIA hacking dump
153: Cryptography,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/153:_Cryptography,cryptography,"If you got a big keyspace, let me search it.","This comic refers to the study of cryptography. We can note the presence of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) logo in the lectern, an association that organizes the most important conferences in the cryptology field. Cueball, behind the lectern at the podium, is describing a proposed crypto system in which a computer program turns a very large number, called the ""key,"" and a message into an encrypted form that can only be read by using the same key, based on the model of a Feistel cipher. Part of any Feistel cipher is the ""round function,"" which determines how the key is applied to the original message; this is applied multiple times with a variety of tricks and techniques to ensure that the process can eventually be reversed. One common component of round functions is the S-box, a simple table that converts input bytes into output bytes, preferably in a way that doesn't correspond to any mathematical rules.  Here, the S-box would be implemented by doing the following (with the computer operation actually shown in the diagrams indicated in parentheses):  This would be run on each round of the cipher to further scramble the message for the next round. As the caption implies, the steps are based on a line from the Missy Elliott song Work It: ""I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it."" As with any encryption system, there must be a way to decrypt the cipher text. In Missy Elliott's song, the phrase ""I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it"" is repeatedly played backward, sounding like gibberish. In the same way, steps to a Feistel cipher-based algorithm are executed in reverse to obtain the original plain text from a cipher text.  The keyspace for a cryptographic algorithm is the number of possible keys the algorithm can possibly accept. For example, AES-256 has a keyspace of 2256 (roughly 1.1579209e+77) possible keys, simply because the algorithm specifies that each key is 256 bits wide. The title text is referring to ""searching a keyspace,"" which is to say, simply trying every key until you find one that works. (For reference, a computer would require roughly the energy of a billion billion supernovas to even count to 2256, let alone actually try each one.) The precise wording, ""If you got a big keyspace, let me search it"" is, of course, another reference to the same song: ""If you got a big **** let me search ya"" (The word ""penis"" is censored by the trumpeting of an elephant).  Cueball is banned from multiple conferences for similar pranks in 541: TED Talk. In response to 541, PyCon organizers jokingly announced that Randall Munroe was banned from PyCon 2009 due to ""last year's disgraceful keynote, 'Web Spiders vs. Red Spiders'."" They also said they instructed their volunteers to refuse admission to him and ""any stick figures who may attempt to register, particularly if they are wearing hats.""  Messages on the PyCon-Organizers mailing list show that this joke was intended to get Randall to come to PyCon: (The links will only work if you're subscribed to the mailing list.)","[Randall Munroe (drawn as Cueball) stands behind a lectern on a podium in front of a large conference audience (consisting of Cueball heads), with a poster hanging beside him.] Randall: My cryptosystem is like any Feistel cipher, except in the S-Boxes we simply take the bitstring down, flip it, and reverse it.  [The poster reads:]  Decryption  01101010     >>  00110101  [inverter symbol]  11001010  [crossed arrows]  01010011   [Caption below the crowd:] I've been barred from speaking at any major cryptography conferences ever since it became clear that all my algorithms were just thinly disguised Missy Elliott songs."
177: Alice and Bob,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/177:_Alice_and_Bob,cryptography,Yet one more reason I'm barred from speaking at crypto conferences.,"Any good cryptography presentation will include at least one story about Alice and Bob. They are the canonical ""protagonists"" of the crypto world, frequently used in illustrations to demonstrate how a cryptographic system works. (The names were mostly chosen to abbreviate to A and B, as well as being of different genders so that they can be distinguished by pronouns alone.)  Here, Randall casts the story in a different light. Instead of Alice and Bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private, Bob is actually having an affair with Alice, and his former partner, upset, cracked the encryption to see what the message contained. Nevertheless, the ""gossipy cryptographic protocol specs"" all took Alice's side (since the goal of any good crypto system is, of course, to succeed in this struggle).  The rest of the comic makes a few other allusions to cryptography:  Finally, in a twist ending, the girlfriend is revealed to be none other than Eve, the eavesdropper, who is also ubiquitous in Alice and Bob stories. Hell hath no fury, indeed.  The title text continues the theme of Randall getting barred from speaking at conferences due to his unusual take on certain topics.  To further spice things up, there are many other characters in the Alice/Bob canon, including Mallory, the malicious attacker, who wants to actually alter the message with nefarious intent; Craig, the cracker, who doesn't particularly care about the message but does care about the passwords used; Plod, a law enforcement officer attempting to access keys or data; and Chuck, a third party in the communication who secretly has a villainous intent.  Alice, Bob, and Eve are mentioned again in comic: 1323: Protocol","[Eve stands in the frame, talking to the reader.] Eve: I'm sure you've heard all about this sordid affair in those gossipy cryptographic protocol specs with those busybodies Schneier and Rivest, always taking Alice's side, always labeling me the attacker. Eve: Yes, it's true. I broke Bob's private key and extracted the text of her messages. But does anyone realize how much it hurt? Eve: He said it was nothing, but everything from the public-key authenticated signatures on the files to the lipstick heart smeared on the disk screamed ""Alice."" Eve: I didn't want to believe. Of course on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack. But I couldn't admit it until I saw it for myself. [Eve places her hands on her hips.] Eve: So before you so quickly label me a third party to the communication, just remember: I loved him first. We had something and she tore it away. She's the attacker, not me. Not Eve."
343: 1337: Part 3,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/343:_1337:_Part_3,cryptography,"I once asked an NSA guy whether they'd broken RSA. And I know I can trust him, because I asked if he was lying to me and he said no.","This is the third part of five in the ""1337"" series. The title 1337 is ""L-eet"", or ""elite"", using the Leet alphabet.  All comics in the series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  The comic is narrated by Cueball as seen in the previous comic, but that Cueball is not shown here, where the man drawn as Cueball is a real person:  Adrian Lamo is a hacker known for being a threat analyst and has penetrated many corporate networks. As far as we know, he has not penetrated any government networks, so helping Elaine physically break into the NSA would probably inspire second thoughts. The use of a rug to cross the barbed wire fence is likely a reference to a scene in Fight Club, where the same method is used to break into a liposuction clinic.  RSA is an encryption algorithm that allows decryption using public keys. No efficient method to break RSA is known. But if the NSA knew any such method, it would be unlikely for them to admit that. However, the NSA have paid RSA to put a backdoor into one of their encryption schemes.  Lawrence Lessig is a political activist focusing on copyright law and intellectual property, as well as a founding board member of Creative Commons.  Steve Jobs was the two-time CEO of Apple Inc. In partnership with Steve Wozniak he founded Apple. He oversaw Apple's return from near bankruptcy, the introduction of the original Macintosh, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. But in the 90s, most of this had not happened yet. The comic is implying that it was Elaine, in fact, who planted those ideas in Jobs' mind (while perching on his bedpost, a nearly-impossible physical task for even a relatively small and light human being - such a stance is often depicted for gargoyles or fictional vampires, the latter of which are associated with nocturnal bedroom-invasions like this).  The final panel is a pun on the Riot grrrls - Riot grrrl is an underground feminist punk rock movement. This metamorphosis in the hands of Randall into Riot Prrl - who presumably prefer to code in Perl. The real Riot Prrl are from Northampton and are into guerilla knitting.  The title text may refer to the urban legend that leads petty criminals to ask each other ""Are you a cop?"" the bottom line being that liars can lie about whether they're lying.","[Outside, Adrian Lamo is helping Elaine Roberts over a barbed wire fence.] It was the late 90's. Elaine crisscrossed the country with Adrian Lamo, the 'Homeless Hacker', learning to gain entry into systems both virtual and physical.

370: Redwall,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/370:_Redwall,cryptography,My Redwall/Jurassic Park crossover fanfic is almost complete!,"This comic references Brian Jacques' series of books, Redwall, which star sapient woodland animals in various high fantasy adventures.  The first panel shows the similarity between the story of Martin the Warrior (from the book Mossflower) and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The joke is that while Martin and Aragorn introduce themselves separately, they then go on to describe their particular story, which turns out to be exactly the same for both of them. Subsequently Martin jinxes Aragorn. Jinx is a common children's game, which is initiated by shouting ""Jinx"" after somebody speaks the same word or sentence at the same time as you. That person is then jinxed, with the usual rules dictating that they are then not permitted to speak until unjinxed by some specific action (usually somebody saying their name).  The second panel deals with the fact that Redwall mentions the name of Satan or The Devil 4 times while it never mentions God or Jesus. Randall then points out that people who protest against Harry Potter because of the series' witchcraft, should take note that Redwall explicitly mentions Satan although it has had little to no negative feedback from more conservative readers.  In the third panel, Randall comments on Redwall's often-used theme of critical messages being left in riddles throughout the Abbey for the occupants to find when they are in need. Randall suggests that he would use public-key cryptography to encode the messages, instead of the elaborate riddles used in the books (some of which are ridiculously easy, which doesn't exactly make for good security when dealing with sensitive information).  In the title text Randall jokes that he is making a crossover fan-fiction with Redwall and Jurassic Park.  Redwall was also referenced in 1688: Map Age Guide and 1722: Debugging.","Notes from reading Redwall books for the first time since childhood.  Some of this feels familiar. Aragorn: Hi, I'm Aragorn. Martin: I'm Martin. Aragorn and Martin: I'm here to reforge my broken sword so I can lead an army against the tyrant threatening my people. I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones. Martin: Jinx!  It startled me when characters mentioned Satan. Redwall: ""By Satan's whiskers..."" Redwall mentions God/Jesus 0 times. Redwall mentions Satan/The Devil 4 times. (Harry Potter protesters, take note.)  Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It's silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them. I would do things differently. Matthias: The inscription is a message from Martin! Brother Methuselah: What does it say? Matthias: Hang on, it's encrypted with my public key."
424: Security Holes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/424:_Security_Holes,cryptography,True story: I had to try several times to upload this comic because my ssh key was blacklisted.,"The ""Debian-OpenSSL fiasco"" was a major security problem discovered in the Debian Linux distribution and its version of the cryptographic library called OpenSSL. With just a tiny change in the software, which was intended to have no effect on security, its random number generator was completely crippled, as was the security of all cryptographic keys generated by the system. The problem was created when a Debian developer removed one line of code which was crucial, even though it could seem like it did nothing useful. More detail about the fiasco: Crippling Crypto: The Debian OpenSSL Debacle, Debian's information page about the problem.  The title text refers also to this issue: After the security problem was found, all cryptographic keys generated or used on the broken operating system needed to be replaced. Many systems introduced special checks for such weak keys, adding the keys to blacklists, thereby preventing their use and forcing users to create new keys. Randall claims he was affected by that when uploading this comic to the server.  The comics on the left presents Cueball as a programmer who, on a whim, removes pieces of code (commenting out the code by prepending the line with two slashes), presumably thinking they are not necessary. The first removed line, MD_update(&m, buf, j); is the exact piece of code which was removed in the Debian fiasco. The next panels show him commenting out fictitious lines of code apparently preventing bad things from happening.  The other part of the comic lists ""security problems"" which were allegedly discovered in other Linux variants afterwards:  Cryptographic software in Fedora Core was allegedly not secure against toy decoder rings.   Xandros (used in Asus Eee PC netbooks) gave superuser privileges to anybody ""if asked in a stern voice"". This is likely a reference to fact that the preinstalled Xandros OS did not require a password for root privileges by default.  Gentoo would succumb to flattery, which may be a reference to Gentoo's notorious difficulty to manage. Any user who is capable of understanding it, might have a large ego, and therefore be susceptible to flattery.  OLPC OS could have been attacked using Jeff Goldblum's laptop computer, which refers to a scene in the Independence Day movie, where Jeff Goldblum's character was able to hack into an alien spaceship using his Apple PowerBook computer - which is a topic of great contempt by geeks who point to the absurdity of such a construction.

The campaign from the Discovery Channel was not called ""Boom De Yada"", but ""I Love the World"". The title ""xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel"" is in reference to this.

Self-reference is a reoccurring theme in Douglas Hofstadter's books, notably Gödel, Escher, Bach which Randall reefers to directly in 24: Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey. Later Hofstadter has been referenced in other comics, such as in the title text of 555: Two Mirrors and 608: Form plus of course in 917: Hofstadter.

463: Voting Machines,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/463:_Voting_Machines,cryptography,"And that's *another* crypto conference I've been kicked out of. C'mon, it's a great analogy!","In the 2008 Ohio primary elections, there were numerous problems with electronic voting machines, which eventually required many districts to revert to pen and paper. Premier Election Solutions, the company that handled the machines, blamed these problems on McAfee anti-virus software.  It is not uncommon to see computer software contract stipulating that the vendor will warrant that software and systems delivered will not contain any viruses or malicious code — a knee-jerk reaction to this is for novice management to include virus-scanning software for systems which otherwise are closed. From a computer programming standpoint, having anti-virus software on an electronic voting machine doesn't make sense because the machine shouldn't be accessing the Internet in a way that would leave it open to virus attacks. While there are a lot of ways that viruses can propagate, ultimately the computer still has to download an executable file and run it, which is something that no election machine should do in normal operation. Hence the question is whether the voting machine manufacturer has taken the proper precaution preventing any external access.   Ideally, voting machines (as well as ATMs and other single-purpose appliances) should be embedded systems, incapable of doing the things that might necessitate anti-virus software. However, in practice such devices are more commonly built as application programs running on ordinary Windows PCs (inside of custom-shaped cases), and they download software updates over the internet.  The comic makes an analogy to a teacher who reassures you that he always wears a condom when teaching. While a condom could be considered ""protection"", and therefore a good thing, common sense dictates that teachers should never end up in a situation where wearing a condom in school would be useful; this parallels the idea that while security in the form of anti-virus software on voting machines could also be considered protection and a good thing, it should never be required. The comment is more likely to make people worried about why the condom is there and what purpose it's serving. Similarly, informed people might worry why a voting machine is connecting to the internet.  In panel one, both the facepalm and ""You're doing it wrong"" are Internet memes, used to mock someone who made a foolish mistake.  The title text refers to 153: Cryptography.","Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold) has blamed Ohio voting machine errors on problems with the machines' McAfee antivirus software.  [Cueball is sitting at a computer, facepalming.] Cueball: Wait. ""Antivirus software""? On voting machines? You're doing it wrong.  [Cueball's friend enters the frame and speaks to Cueball.] Friend: Why? Security is good, right? Cueball: Of course. But, well—  Cueball: Imagine you're at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching.  Friend: Ah. Strictly speaking, it's better than the alternative— Cueball: —Yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong."
504: Legal Hacks,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/504:_Legal_Hacks,cryptography,It's totally a reasonable modern analogue. Jefferson would have been all about crypto.,"Megan notices that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is blocking access to some webpages. Cueball is thankful that cryptography offers a way around such censorship.   Encryption, sometimes called ""cryptography,"" or ""crypto"" for short, is the art of transmitting messages that can only be read by the intended receiver(s) by using mathematical techniques to conceal (""encrypt"") the data in the message. One common and effective way to encrypt messages is the RSA algorithm, which is based on the difficulty of integer factorization for products of two prime numbers.  Being able to share unbreakable codes and decrypt other people's codes gives countries a military advantage - for example, in World War II, the Americans and British were often able to figure out where a German attack would be coming and send reinforcements there, because they had cracked the German codes. Because of this, the United States government initially tried to keep the mathematical details of strong encryption algorithms (including RSA) inside the country by classifying the algorithms as a weapon. It is a crime to share certain kinds of weapons technology with other countries without permission. Amateur and professional cryptographers, angry about the attempt to restrict their work, lobbied the government to change the rule and stop treating cryptography as a weapon, in part so that they could continue to collaborate with colleagues overseas, and in part because they wanted the ability to pass secret messages that the government could not easily decrypt. The export restrictions were gradually loosened and would have mostly been lifted by the year 2000.  In the comic, Megan makes the provocative and counter-intuitive point that perhaps the cryptographic community could have best ensured easy access to the RSA technique by *allowing* the government to treat RSA as a weapon, and then, once everyone is certain that RSA is a weapon, invoking the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, commonly known as the ""right to bear arms"" amendment (that is, the right to own and use weapons). In other words, if RSA were a weapon, it would be granted constitutional protections. This interpretation is likely a reference to the exceptionally strong antipathy towards arms control in the Southern United States (and not a whole lot weaker in most areas of the Northern and Western states).  Any attempts made by the government to restrict distribution or ownership of firearms (even those which are very similar to military-grade weapons) are typically countered very aggressive opposition from pro-gun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association. These political forces have made most gun restrictions politically untenable.  Megan is likely suggesting that classifying RSA as a weapon would gain the crypto community very powerful and unlikely political allies; on the flip side, if the government had already ruled it a weapon that needed to be restricted for national security purposes, it could easily invoke the same clauses that allows it to restrict actual military-grade hardware such as automatic weapons, explosives and chemical or biological weapons). Megan may also be hinting that, in the future, the US government might try to restrict access to encryption algorithms, making it necessary for cryptographers to defend their rights to them.  Cueball is surprised and impressed by this point, and pauses to contemplate Megan's strategy.  The title text claims that this is a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution, because cryptography (a modern weapon) is analogous to muskets and cannons (the weaponry in use in the 1780s, when the Second Amendment was drafted). As evidence for the analogy, the title text points out that Jefferson would have been a big fan of cryptography, which is plausible, because President Thomas Jefferson (the 3rd President of the United States) was an amateur scientist who enjoyed studying a very wide variety of fields (in fact, he invented the Jefferson disk, an encryption device that was quite advanced for its time). The point is somewhat facetious, because it is hard to imagine a modern technique that Jefferson would not ""be totally into."" Also, the mere assertion that an early President would have been a fan of a technique is not very good evidence that the technique would be legally permitted by a particular Amendment.","[Megan sits at her computer, Cueball standing behind her.] Megan: Another ISP's filtering content.

[Megan, sitting in her chair, is looking back towards Cueball, presumably off-panel right.] Megan: You know, I think the crypto community took the wrong side in that fight. We should've lobbied to keep it counted as a weapon. Cueball: Why?

538: Security,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/538:_Security,cryptography,"Actual actual reality: nobody cares about his secrets. (Also, I would be hard-pressed to find that wrench for $5.)","The ""crypto nerd"" would be concerned with strongly encrypting data on their personal machine. This would conceivably come in handy when ""villains"" attempt to steal information on his computer. The crypto nerd imagines that due to his advanced encryption, the crackers will be ultimately defeated. Randall suggests that in the real world, people with the desire to access this information would simply use torture to coerce the nerd to give them the password. Both panels also reference the amount of money used to access the data. In the first the villain is willing to use millions of dollars to construct a super computer, while in the second, he simply uses a $5 wrench. The comic effectively states, completely accurately, that the weakest part of computer security is not the computer, but the user.  RSA is a commonly used, public key encryption method. Current standards typically use 1024, 2048, and (more recently) 4096 bit keys. These encryption methods are not yet (feasibly) breakable. A 4096-bit key will remain unbreakable for the foreseeable future.  The title text pokes fun at typical users, who do not have data that would be worth anything to anyone but themselves. Therefore, it is unlikely that the above situation would ever occur. Additionally, the wrench used in the second panel is large, and presumably more than the $5 referenced by the thug.","A Crypto nerd's imagination: [Cueball is holding a laptop, and his friend is examining it.] Cueball: His laptop's encrypted.

593: Voynich Manuscript,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/593:_Voynich_Manuscript,cryptography,"Wait, is that the ORIGINAL voynich manuscript? Where did you GET that? Wanna try playing a round of Druids and Dicotyledons?","The Voynich manuscript is a very detailed book written in an unknown script, describing plants and recipes, most of which lack a real-world analogue. Over the past few decades, linguists and cryptographers have unsuccessfully attempted to decode the book. A cut out from the book is depicted in the first frame (real or similar).  Tabletop role-playing games (such as Dungeons and Dragons) are fantasy games with extremely detailed descriptions of fantastical worlds. The invented language is probably a reference to The Lord of the Rings in which author J. R. R. Tolkien invented several languages of which Sindarin (Grey elvish), and Quenya (High elvish), are the most famous.  After being shown the manuscript for the first time by Megan, Cueball argues that it should be obvious that it's just an ancient role-playing-game rulebook, since the human tendency to invent fantastical worlds must have also existed in the past. That it is this obvious was again stated when the manuscript was referenced in 1501: Mysteries.  In the last panel the book is used, 500 years ago, to play a game  similar to Dungeons and Dragons. They speak in a somewhat outdated English. The reference to the real plant Wolfsbane could also be a reference to another invented world, as it is memorably mentioned in the first book of the Harry Potter series.  After concluding this, a shocked Cueball then asks in the title text how Megan got her hands on the original manuscript (which is in the Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library). He then unexpectedly goes on to suggest the prosaic activity of playing Druids and Dicotyledons, assuming such a game could be defined by the manuscript.","[Weird root vegetables surround a strange script.]  [Megan holding up book to Cueball.] Megan: This is the Voynich manuscript— a book, allegedly 500 years old, written in an unrecognized script. It's some kind of visual encyclopedia of imaginary plants and undeciphered ""recipes"".  [Megan points while Cueball opens the book.] Megan: It could be a hoax, a lost language, a cipher, an alien text, glossolatia — no one knows. Cueball: No one? But it's obvious.  [Megan continues to talk. Cueball holds the now closed book.] Megan: ... Obvious? Linguists and cryptographers have been stumped for decades. Cueball: They forget. Human nature doesn't change.  [Close up of Megan and Cueball - the book is off panel.] Cueball: Just imagine someone found a book from our time, full of lists, illustrations, tables, and long, dry descriptions of nonexistent worlds written in an invented language. What have they found? Megan: ...Dear Lord. It is obvious.  [Three people are standing around pawns and a die. One is holding a sheet of paper, another is holding a book, the third is holding a scythe. At the top of the panel there is a frame with the following text:] 500 Years Earlier: Person #1: Forsooth!

1039: RuBisCO,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1039:_RuBisCO,cryptography,Bruce Schneier believes safewords are fundamentally insecure and recommends that you ask your partner to stop via public key signature.,"Safe words are designated words for sexual play which are meant to be called if one partner is uncomfortable with the way things are proceeding as alternatives to simply saying ""no"" or ""stop"", which may be used to express playacted reluctance by a submissive partner who actually wants to continue. Calling the pre-chosen ""safe word"" would be a sign to stop. To prevent accidental usage, people generally pick words that they wouldn't normally use. In the case of this comic, the characters are chemists, and the uncommon word they happen to have chosen is Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, also known as RuBisCO (which actually isn't a very uncommon word in the scientific world, as it's the most abundant protein on earth, but it would be uncommon to use the full word). However, the length of the word makes it impractical for a safe word, as it would take too long to say; indeed, using the shorter form ""RuBisCO"" would normally be a fine safe word.  The title text mentions Bruce Schneier, a computer security professional, and public keys which is the publicly known half of public-key cryptography, which uses two mathematically linked keys to decrypt information. The joke is that Schneier considers safewords as a type of security and thus believes they are not safe enough and recommend the key signature. However, whereas it takes a long time to say RuBisCO in full during your submission, it would be impossible to use any public keys to stop your partner.","[Person in background (out-of-frame) screams out this word over all 3 panels.]  Sub: RIBULOSEBISPH..  Sub: ...OSPHATECARBOXYL...  Sub: ...ASEOXYGENASE! Dom: Oh, Sorry! Megan: Man, chemists pick the worst safewords."
1181: PGP,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1181:_PGP,cryptography,"If you want to be extra safe, check that there's a big block of jumbled characters at the bottom.","PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a program which can be used to encrypt and/or sign data, including messages sent as emails. Encrypting means encoding data in a way that requires a secret key to decrypt and read; signing means that there is a code included in the data which can be used to verify the identify of the sender and that the data has not been altered in transit.  In the case of the email in this comic, it has only been signed; not encrypted (hence, the top of the first line of text can be seen and is legible in normal English). This is more common than encryption, as reading an encrypted message would require the recipient to already be a PGP user. In fact, the use of PGP even to sign email messages is so rare that most people have probably never seen a signed message. Because a signed email is so rare, and because it is already legible and unencrypted, Randall is making the tongue-in-cheek observation that few users, technical or otherwise, actually know how to use the signature to verify the authenticity of the sender using the PGP signature, and that such users can safely assume that since there is a signature, that is good enough evidence that the message is authentic. Further, because PGP signatures are so rare and probably ignored by most recipients, he suggests one would not expect anyone to even bother creating a false PGP signature; therefore the mere existence of a PGP header would suggest authenticity.  The title text extends the joke by suggesting you confirm there's a bunch of random characters in the footer (this is the actual signature that PGP generates which can be used to verify the authenticity of the email). Again, Randall is humorously suggesting that the existence of the block is itself sure evidence of authenticity.","How to use PGP to verify that an email is authentic: Look for this text at the top [In mail header, light grey.] Reply [Highlighted, with arrow pointing to it from the text ""Look for this text at the top"" above.] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- [In mail message, light grey.] HASH: SHA256 Hey, First of all, thanks for taking care of  [After mail message.] If it's there, the email is probably fine"
1269: Privacy Opinions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1269:_Privacy_Opinions,cryptography,I'm the Philosopher until someone hands me a burrito.,"According to the title, the comic is about opinions on internet privacy in general. Six positions are offered as options. Four of the positions are tagged negatively by the author by their subtitles alone: the Crypto Nut, the Conspiracist, the Nihilist, and the Exhibitionist, all of which have negative valences in contemporary English. That the viewer is encouraged to identify negatively with these four positions is further encouraged by the content of the panels, as those characters are depicted either as having such boring lives that they have no need for privacy (the Crypto Nut, the Nihilist), or as being crazy (the Conspiracist, the Exhibitionist).  A fifth position, the Philosopher, is tagged somewhat ambivalently by the author: Megan, or possibly a look-alike, is depicted as boring her interlocutor, yet in the title text, the author admits that he is usually the Philosopher. Also, ""Philosopher"" in vernacular English is neutrally valenced, potentially having the ability to expound either wisdom (sophia) or sophistry. It is also a synonym for Sage, the sixth position. As the author condones his own movement from Philosopher to Sage, he thus indicates that the Philosopher is to be viewed negatively, even if it is a tempting position to hold.  The title of the sixth position, the ""Sage"", is positively valenced in contemporary English, and the author in the title text states that once he obtains a ""burrito"" – i.e., a ""real"" thing, he switches from the Philosopher to the Sage. The internal evidence presented thus far therefore is entirely consistent; the author encourages the reader to identify with the Sage. However, the choice of Beret Guy to represent the Sage undercuts this somewhat as Beret Guy is frequently seen as bizarrely disconnected from reality in a way that is maladaptive (e.g. 1030: Keyed) and overly obsessed with food to the point of creating trouble and potential self-harm (e.g. 452: Mission).  By presenting five negatively tagged positions followed by a positively tagged sixth and final one, the author follows a rhetorical commonplace of listing and refuting a number of positions one by one, concluding with the favored and best one, which is not refuted and should be accepted both on its own merits and by virtue of being the last one standing. The comic therefore implies that no other (significant) positions exist.  Having completed the rhetorical analysis of the comic, we are now in a position to understand the meaning of ""Internet Privacy"".  Panels #3 and 5 directly reference the American NSA. Panel #5's ""exhibitionist"" also references Google, but the characters in the panel appear to be NSA agents (one wears an official cap and they are viewing the exhibitionist on an official, government-looking monitor). Likewise, the focus of the ""Nihilist"" is that the joke is on the people who gather the data, rather than those who are subsequently able to make use of it (such as Facebook's users rather than ""Facebook"" itself; i.e., Facebook's employees and, by extension, its advertisers). The content of the actual data is only mentioned in panels #2, 4, and 5, and in each panel, it is suggested that it is meaningless or trivial. The Sage underscores the notion that any data known about him does not bother him, and therefore must be meaningless or trivial. The reader is thus encouraged to believe that it does not actually matter whether others discover personal data about him/her.  The comic is therefore what social theorists call reductive, because it reduces the range of possibilities of ""Opinions on Internet Privacy"" to an artificially and simplistically narrow subset; in this case, individuals concerned with government or corporate agencies using data that they have gathered on individuals, and the futility of worrying about such things. The comic does not admit the possibility of other ""opinions on internet privacy"" – namely, that individuals might have legitimate concerns with governmental or corporate uses of their data, let alone other individuals' access to data that is assembled and distributed by corporations such as Facebook. The comic likewise does not consider the possibility of individuals having more interesting lives than the characters depicted, and therefore very real concerns about their privacy due to the activities that they engage in that are potentially more career limiting (should they be discovered) than obsessing about cryptography or eating a burrito.  The comic is ""functionally"" reductive, as opposed to ""intentionally"" reductive, because the reduction is the function or effect of the comic for readers who read it straightforwardly. There is not enough internal evidence in the comic to maintain that the author intentionally excluded other viable opinions on internet privacy; it could be that they are just not on his radar. For example, we do not have enough information in the comic to claim that the author is against civil rights; it could be simply that he doesn't often think about them. Likewise, it would exceed the evidence of the comic to claim that the author believes that schoolteachers who use the internet to facilitate legal but frowned-upon sexual behaviors should lose their jobs if they are found out due to internet privacy breaches; it could be that the author simply hasn't bothered to worry about these matters if they don't affect him personally. This adjudication – whether the comic is ""intentionally"" reductive or not – may only be made on the basis of external evidence; that is, data known about the author from sources beyond this comic.  An alternative interpretation of the title text is that it is not Randall speaking his own opinion, but instead represents Beret Guy's (i.e. the ""Sage's"") perspective. Randall may indeed have some concern with internet privacy, which would be consistent with the views on open-source security expressed in 463: Voting Machines, for example. In other cases, such as 1490: Atoms and 1419: On the Phone, the title text has been used as additional, farcical statements made by characters in the strip, rather than as Randall expressing his own views. Under this interpretation, Beret Guy would be prone to philosophizing about security, but then be easily distracted by a burrito; this is consistent with Beret Guy's general behavior.  Additional observations about the comic follow.  The release of the comic on this date could be to coincide with the premiere of South Park's 17th season on the same date, which starts with an episode (Let Go, Let Gov) in which Cartman discovers that the NSA has been spying on him.  The title text is to suggest that he enjoys burritos so much that being handed one even while philosophizing (his natural state) would stop him in his tracks to eat the burrito, thus becoming a pseudo-sage concerned only with the burrito at the exclusion of the topic of internet security. The burrito is later mentioned as a way to stay connected to the real word (compared to the world of art) in 1496: Art Project.","Opinions on Internet Privacy The Philosopher: Megan: ""Privacy"" is an impractical way to think about data in a digital world so unlike the one in which our soci-- Ponytail:  So bored.   The Crypto Nut: Cueball: My data is safe behind six layers of symmetric and public-key algorithms. Friend: What data is it? Cueball: Mostly me emailing with people about cryptography.

1286: Encryptic,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1286:_Encryptic,cryptography,It was bound to happen eventually. This data theft will enable almost limitless [xkcd.com/792]-style password reuse attacks in the coming weeks. There's only one group that comes out of this looking smart: Everyone who pirated Photoshop.,"Web sites and other computers that authenticate users via passwords need to be able to know if the user typed in the right password. But storing the password itself on the computer has been known to be unnecessarily risky since the publication of Password Security: A Case History in 1978. In that paper, Robert Morris and Ken Thompson demonstrated the practice of using a slow, cryptographically-secure one-way hash function, so that even if the password file is stolen, it will be very hard to figure out what the passwords are, so long as the passwords themselves are suitably complex. They also pioneered the use of a ""salt"" which makes each password hash completely different even if two users use the same password. See A tour of password questions and answers for background on salts and suitably slow hash functions.  Adobe, however, ignored these well-known principles, and instead stored over a hundred million passwords in a reversibly encrypted way, using a terrible choice of encryption methods which exposes a great deal of information about the passwords, and does not involve a salt. This password database was recently obtained by someone and released on the Internet.  In particular, Adobe used Triple DES, an older encryption algorithm which can still be relatively secure when properly used, but they used it improperly. It works on 64-bit (8 character) blocks. Assuming that the passwords are stored in plain ASCII, this means that a sequence of 8 characters in a password which starts on a character position which is a multiple of eight is always encrypted to the same result. Therefore, two passwords starting with ""12345678"" would start with the same block after being encrypted. Furthermore, this means that you can actually get a very good idea of the length of the password since anything with only one block is a password with length between 1 and 8 characters, and having two blocks implies it has between 9 and 16 characters, etc.  Adobe also stored hints users created for their passwords. That means that an attacker knows not only if the same 8 characters are used for multiple passwords but also has some hints for guessing them. That means that common password portions should be easy to recover and that any user may be ""compromised"" by someone else using a part of the same password and providing a good hint. As an example, a password having three hints ""Big Apple"", ""Twin Towers"" and ""If you can make it there"" is probably ""New York"" or a simple variation on that. The weakness here is that no decryption and therefore no hard cracking has to take place, you just group the passwords by their encrypted blocks and try to solve them like a crossword puzzle. These weaknesses have already been used to presumably identify a password used by Edward Snowden, as discussed at 7 Habits of Highly Effective Hackers: Can someone be targeted using the Adobe breach?.  The examples are not taken from the actual leaked file, since that uses a different format, and the examples are evidently cleverly crafted to make a nice crossword-like puzzle, which can be solved as shown in the Passwords section below.  As mentioned on http://filosottile.github.io/analyzing-the-adobe-leaked-passwords/ the data in the comic isn't real and contains a hidden message. If the ""user password"" hashes are Base64 encoded, they read:  More readable:  E.g., with the initial unique hash blocks: python -c ""print '4e18acc1ab27a2d6a0a2876eb1ea1fca'.decode('hex_codec').encode('base64')""  The last letter ""r"" is not fully encoded in the data shown, but any letter from ""g"" to ""v"" produces the same binary data.  The title text makes a reference to a previous comic: Black Hat's trouble with what to do with stolen passwords. It also states that users of pirated Photoshop are the winners here. This is because in order to make Photoshop pirate-able, it was modified (cracked) by removing the requirement for registration so their passwords were not sent to Adobe and therefore are not present in the leaked file.  Soon after this comic was published, the most common 1000 passwords were actually compiled into a set of 10 interactive online crosswords, inspired by the comic.  The title itself is a reference to cryptic crosswords.  Note that characters in the passwords could be upper or lower case, and they may involve common substitutions like ""0"" (number zero) for ""O"" (letter O); therefore, the clues cannot guarantee that the answer shown here is precisely correct. Nevertheless, we have plenty of information for a brute force attack.","Hackers recently leaked 153 million Adobe user emails, encrypted passwords, and password hints. Adobe encrypted the passwords improperly, misusing block-mode 3DES. The result is something wonderful:  The greatest crossword puzzle in the history of the world"
1323: Protocol,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1323:_Protocol,cryptography,"Changing the names would be easier, but if you're not comfortable lying, try only making friends with people named Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.","Alice, Bob, and Eve are role names traditionally used in describing cryptographic protocols. Rather than talking about ""Person A"", ""Person B"", ""Person C"", names beginning with each letter are used instead, and giving them different genders let pronouns be used to shorten discussions. For example: ""Person A sends Person B a message encoded with Person B's public key"" is much easier to parse when written as ""Alice sends Bob a message encoded with his public key."" Eve is short for ""eavesdropper"" - a person trying to find out what's being said in the conversations between the other people. The classic situation involves Alice wanting to send a secret message to Bob, while Eve (the eavesdropper), attempts to read the message, ideally without Alice or Bob ever finding out. Additional participants such as Carol (Person C) can be added if necessary. The list of names has become very standardised over time as described at Alice and Bob.  The joke here is that any computer scientist, hearing the names used, will think that they are listening to a cryptography problem. By changing the names in a story to these role names, you can induce them to listen carefully to boring stories. The fewer the interesting details, the more it sounds like a general problem, so very boring stories are actually the easiest.  The title text shows a more radical approach to the problem, for people who do not feel comfortable about lying. In this approach, you only make friends with people who have the appropriate names already.  The comic title also can be interpreted in two ways. First, the computer scientist thinks the conversation is about an encryption protocol. Second, the way the conversation is carried resembles a protocol used by many data communication systems, where one side sends data while the other sends back an acknowledgement upon receiving the data. In this case, the data are the lines of the boring story.  In comic 177: Alice and Bob these names are used in the same context. Instead of Alice and Bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private, Bob is actually having an affair with Alice. Eve —his former partner— cracked the encryption to see what the message contained. Thus, this comic seems to continue the Alice/Bob romance, jealous-Eve plot, with Eve apparently confronting Alice over her text message to Bob.","[Cueball is telling a story to a Computer Scientist who is seated at his desk.] Cueball: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere. Computer Scientist: Uh huh. Cueball: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place. Computer Scientist: With you so far. Cueball: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet. Computer Scientist: Yeah? CAPTION: I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story."
1553: Public Key,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1553:_Public_Key,cryptography,"I guess I should be signing stuff, but I've never been sure what to sign. Maybe if I post my private key, I can crowdsource my decisions about what to sign.","In Public-key cryptography, two keys are generated for a user. The public key can be used to encrypt messages, but not decrypt them. The private key is necessary for decryption, and as its name implies, is meant to be used solely by the user.  Since the public key is initially designated to be shared, anyone who has that key can send the user an encrypted message that only he or she can decrypt. Cueball has been following this rule, but he notices that it appears nobody has ever used his public key for anything. He contemplates sharing his private key, which he believes would generate more interest in him personally. However, he appears to overlook the fact that doing so would allow anyone to decrypt messages sent to him, thus defeating the entire purpose of encryption.  The title text refers to another feature of Public-key cryptography: In addition to assuring that certain messages can only be read by a specific key owner, it can also assure that certain messages could only have been written by a specific key owner, by ""signing"" it using the private key. Anyone can read a signed message, but readers with the public key can then verify that the owner of the private key wrote (or at least signed) the message, rather than someone pretending to be the owner. If Cueball published his private key, then anybody could sign any message as him, effectively impersonating him and also defeating the purpose of encryption.  Crowdsourcing is the term used for delegating work or tasks to a largely volunteered and uncontrolled set of people on the Internet.  It is similar in concept to outsourcing, in which work is delegated to an external source of labor, typically a company in a foreign country. Famous instances of crowdsourcing include reCAPTCHA (in which users both verify they are human and help digitize words and phrases in books that digitization software cannot understand) and a farm in the UK in which ordinary Internet users make decisions about how the farm is run.  In Cueball's case, delegating decisions about his contracts and spending to the Internet is not likely to be a wise choice.  When Cueball first created the key pair, he imagined it would be something he used from time to time, for reading messages only intended for him or for sending ""signed"" messages.  Since nothing of the sort happened, he imagines releasing both keys might cause some activity, and at this point he is happier with a ""bad"" outcome than with a boring one.  Randall previously ironically mentioned a public key in 370: Redwall.","[In the first panel, Cueball is sitting in a chair and is using a laptop.] Cueball (thinking): I've been posting my public key for 15 years now, but no one has ever asked me for it or used it for anything as far as I can tell.  [This is followed by two beat panels where Cueball just sits there. doing nothing, not even thinking.]  [In the final panel he again uses his laptop and thinks.] Cueball (thinking): Maybe I should try posting my private key instead."
1808: Hacking,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1808:_Hacking,cryptography,"The dump also contains a list of millions of prime factors, a 0-day Tamagotchi exploit, and a technique for getting gcc and bash to execute arbitrary code.","This comic is referencing an incident on the day before this comic was released, March 7, 2017, in which WikiLeaks exposed thousands of hacking exploits (thus the title) and programs from the CIA (see for instance this article: WikiLeaks Just Dumped a Mega-Trove of CIA Hacking Secrets). Many of the tools that were in the leak were similar to publicly available tools, or not entirely unexpected, with several coming from sites such as StackOverflow and Reddit.  The main joke in this comic refers to the common practice of adding spaces between parts of an email address when publishing them on websites.  For example, ""[email protected]"" may be written as ""john dot doe at example dot org"".  The purported goal of doing this is to thwart page scraping bots from harvesting the correct email addresses and prevent them from becoming the target of spam or being sold as address lists for email marketers.    In this comic, Ponytail tells Cueball that the CIA has a tool which can delete such spaces. Such a tool can fix the space and most likely convert the words ""dot"" and ""at"" into their respective symbols. This will overcome the problems faced by harvesting tools, and make these email addresses more prone to receive spam.   Cueball appears shocked to hear this news, but given the caption below, stating that this was one of the less dramatic revelations from the CIA hacking dump, this is likely sarcasm by Cueball (and Randall). In fact, it is quite simple to devise a program which detects and converts/removes such spaces; it's naive to believe that one can prevent e-mail addresses from being harvested just by writing the addresses with space or omitting @ etc. Some people might not realize that he's being sarcastic, though, and that misunderstanding might be part of the joke.  The title text lists three other undramatic (fictitious) hacking exploits which sound more interesting, but are still more or less useless, and certainly not dramatic news. They are:",[Ponytail is writing on her laptop at her desk while Cueball looks over her shoulder.] Ponytail: You know how sometimes people put a space in their email address to make it harder to harvest? Cueball: Yeah? Ponytail: They have a tool that can delete the space! Cueball: Oh my god.  [Caption below the panel:] Less-dramatic revelations from the CIA hacking dump
378: Real Programmers,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/378:_Real_Programmers,emacs,Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.,"This comic is a satire on the idea of a Real Programmer. To quote Wikipedia ""...the computer folklore term Real Programmer has come to describe the archetypical 'hardcore' programmer who eschews the modern languages and tools of the day in favour of more direct and efficient solutions—closer to the hardware."" The implication is that modern programmers are coddled by today's tools of the trade, which eschew detailed understanding for simple workflows.  The first figure is writing a piece of code when another programmer ridicules him for using GNU nano. Nano is a text editor - a program often used to edit the source code of other programs; it is modern, simple, and easy-to-use. He goes on to say that ""REAL"" programmers use Emacs. GNU Emacs is a popular editor known for its vast profusion of features and extensions to perform all sorts of functions beyond simple text editing, and is widely regarded as one of the best examples of software. The comic continues from here as a series of programmers state progressively more obscure or outdated methods. Culminating in the final programmer who claims that ""real"" programmers use butterflies.  His description of his rather surreal programming method is ludicrously complicated and would require an absurd amount of knowledge and forethought to pull off, bordering on omniscience. In the final panel the Emacs programmer claims that there's an Emacs code to do that.  Emacs and Vim are both text editors. ed is a line editor. These represent progressively more ""old school"" solutions to the problem of editing code. cat is a Unix program that concatenates and outputs the contents of files; and it's usually run from a Unix shell, which allows its output to be written or appended to a file.  Using a magnetised needle to flip bits on a hard drive requires nanometric precision and intuitive mastery of binary code, but in the early days of programming people did use needles sometimes to fix bugs on Punched cards.  When final character suggests the utterly surreal idea of using butterflies he is referring to the Butterfly effect, a ""phenomenon whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome"". The joke at this point relies on stretching the connection between the ideas of ""difficult-to-use"" and ""requires detailed understanding of underlying principles"", to suggest that not only do Real Programmers know everything about how computers work, but they know how to manipulate the ambient physical environment in elaborate ways to cause computers to do what they want, akin to performing trick shots that accomplish feats of programming.  The fact that Emacs already has a command for this simply exasperates the programmers frustration with modern programming tools.  GNU Emacs succeeds despite being riddled with featuritis.  Emacs commands are usually referred to by the key sequence required to activate them, such as ""C-x M-c"" (Control-x Meta-c, though this exact key sequence is a bit different from most Emacs commands). The macro referenced is a pun on the play/movie titled ""M. Butterfly"". The butterfly programmer saying ""Dammit, Emacs"" plays on Emacs' notoriety for its kitchen sink design approach of tossing in all the features and options that anybody might ever conceivably want. By way of example, later versions of Emacs actually added a totally useless ""M-x butterfly"" command as an easter egg, in reference to this very comic: see the YouTube demo and screenr demo.  The title text further suggests manipulating the universal constants in order to create a universe in which the required computer data will exist. Programming of this sort would require power and knowledge akin to the Abrahamic God.  According to the logic, the programmers shown may even represent the fulfillment of this master programmers plan. The universe may have been designed in such a way that the programmers ancestry would result in his parents, who would meet and have a child, who would learn programming and eventually find himself in a position where he undertakes the task of creating a program, which fills the disk with the desired data. In tandem, of course, all of the people involved with creating and developing all the required hardware, software, raw materials, computer science, electricity, logic (etc., etc., etc.) would have to be part of the master plan. Put simply, it would probably be simpler just to use Emacs.   The use of a magnetized needle may also be a reference to the Apollo AGC guidance computer, whose instructions were physically written as patterns of wires looped around or through cylindrical magnets in order to record binary code.  This comic hints at the ""editor wars"", an ongoing debate of Vim and Emacs users over which of the two editors is the best. The editor wars are mentioned again in 1823: Hottest Editors.","[A Cueball like man sits at a computer, programming. Cueball stands behind him and looks over his shoulder.] Cueball: nano?

561: Well,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/561:_Well,emacs,"I'll concede ergonomics anecdotally, but none of the studies of Dvorak were at all rigorous (the most-cited Navy study was overseen by Dvorak himself). And the 'slow typists down' thing is a myth. Also EMACS RULES VI DROOLS WOOOOOOO!","This is the first comic in the Well series. It was followed by 568: Well 2.  Uncomfortable truths are truths that exist, but no one wants to have to think about them.  The first is about Firefly, the TV series created by Joss Whedon and canceled by FOX, due to poor ratings performance, after airing the first 13 episodes out-of-order. In Firefly, the main languages spoken are English and Chinese (supposedly in equal measure), because China was the only other world power besides America to go to space (Joss Whedon's own explanation on the DVDs). However, there are very few actual Asians on-screen.  The second is about two different keyboard layouts, QWERTY and Dvorak. Early typewriters used to jam easily if two nearby keys were struck at about the same time. To work around this, the QWERTY layout, named after the first six letters on its keys, scattered common letter combinations around the keyboard, thus greatly avoiding the problem. (A common myth states that this was done to slow typists down; this was not the case.) Later typewriter mechanisms were less prone to jamming, which prompted a few people to try to create alternative layouts, such as Blickensderfer's DHIATENSOR layout in 1892, or the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard in 1932. Such layouts never really caught on; by then, typists were all very used to the QWERTY layout, and were unwilling to take the time and effort to learn a new one.  In the Dvorak layout, August Dvorak placed the most frequently used keys at the most easily accessible places; Dvorak's advocates claim this reduces typing effort and repetitive strain (as mentioned in the title text) while increasing typing speed and accuracy. However, rigorous, unbiased studies have yet to clearly show significant superiority. (As the title text mentions, the most commonly cited study in Dvorak's favor was overseen by Dvorak himself during his US Navy service in World War II.)  This was the second comic to refer to Dvorak after 554: Not Enough Work, and since then it has become a recurrent theme on xkcd.  The third and fourth truths are connected: they involve the two people receiving them and (presumably) their relationship with each other. Every time Cueball said ""I love you"" he never really meant it; whereas Megan meant it every time she said ""I love you"". This is very uncomfortable for both!  The title text perpetuates the Emacs vs. vi debate. Both Emacs and Vim are text editors that are frequently used as general-language editors of source code. The issue is that, while Emacs is more user-friendly and customizable, vim is more lightweight while needing few keystrokes in text editing. Because of this balance, fans of Emacs and fans of vim end up fighting each other.","[A sign sits by a well.] The Uncomfortable Truths Well  [A Cueball-like guy and Ponytail are lined up for the well; the guy throws a coin in.] Well: For a universe that's supposed to be half Chinese, Firefly sure doesn't have any Asians.

1172: Workflow,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1172:_Workflow,emacs,There are probably children out there holding down spacebar to stay warm in the winter! YOUR UPDATE MURDERS CHILDREN.,"Users will often try to work around bugs in software, and are sometimes able to get used to having the bugs around. Some bugs are even interpreted as features and users complain when the software authors fix them. A similar effect may be caused by other improvements, particularly those which involve changes in the user interface.  This comic shows a somewhat extreme example. An unnamed application had a bug causing the CPU to overheat whenever the spacebar was held down too long. In version 10.17, this bug was fixed. Soon, LongtimeUser4 complained that they relied on the fact that the CPU overheats if the spacebar is held down. They had stumbled across this ""feature"" (which is, again, more weird than usual) and took advantage of it to streamline their workflow, and they wanted an option to re-enable it.  Emacs (name originally derived from Editor MACroS) is a text editor originally written at MIT in 1976 and adopted into the GNU project in 1984. The control key sees extensive use in Emacs, and since it's hard to reach, users often remap it to Caps Lock or some other key. LongtimeUser4 fixed the problem very clumsily (""horrifying,"" as the admin puts it) and is annoyed that their kludge no longer works. The moral of the story is that you can't please everyone.  Examples of real life changes in software which, though often acclaimed by critics, caused great annoyance among existing user base include ribbons introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, Start screen of Windows 8 or Unity desktop manager bundled with Ubuntu since version 11.10. In the latter case, developers included an option to use the older interface; for the rest, applications emulating old behavior were developed by third parties.  The title text makes a hyperbole to humorous effect; children will freeze to death during the winter because they won't be warmed by a rather unconventional heater. Making (or creating an illusion of) a connection between one's opinion and care for children's welfare is a common method of gaining public support, as such arguments are hard to deflect without sounding cruel and uncaring.","[Changelog for version 10.17 of a piece of software.] One change listed: ""The CPU no longer overheats when you hold down the spacebar"" Comments: LongtimeUser4 writes: This update broke my workflow! My control key is hard to reach, so I hold spacebar instead, and I configured Emacs to interpret a rapid temperature rise as ""control"". Admin writes: That's horrifying. LongtimeUser4 writes: Look, my setup works for me. Just add an option to reenable spacebar heating.  Every change breaks someone's workflow."
1341: Types of Editors,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1341:_Types_of_Editors,emacs,m-x machineofdeath-mode,"WYSIWYG, pronounced, ""wizz-ee-wig"" IPA /ˈwɪziˌwɪg/, is an acronym that stands for ""What you see is what you get"". In regards to computers, it refers to text editors in which the user can see exactly what will be published as they are typing it. The comic compares various types of editors, each one a play-on-words on WYSIWYG.  The title text is a fictitious command, meta-x machineofdeath-mode, to the highly extensible Emacs text editor. Emacs operates in various ""modes"", which are customizations for specific purposes. Placing Emacs into ""Machine of Death"" mode would turn it into a WYSIHYD editor. (For another fictitious emacs command see 378: Real Programmers).   This is most likely also a reference to ""Machine of Death"". This book from 2010 is a collection of short stories edited by amongst other Ryan North (of Dinosaur Comics) mentioned here since the idea was based on one of his comics. Since Randall Munroe wrote one of the stories the reference is very likely. All the stories are based around a device, the ""Machine of Death"", that can predict, with 100% accuracy though generally with extreme ambiguity, how people die from a drop of their blood. In many of the stories very unusual deaths are predicted, often in a very literal way, but not so you know when or where you will die. From the official home page the entire book can be downloaded for free as a PDF file. (Randall's story begins on page 421 - or page 218 of the two sided PDF file. It is simply called ""?""). In 1525: Emojic 8 Ball the default question is How will I die? and can then be answered by an Emojic 8 Ball, which would make it a type of Machine of Death.","[There are four panels, each with different headings and explanations of the headings above the panels.]  [The first three panels shows two titled text boxes, one above the other, with text inside.

1200: Authorization,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1200:_Authorization,identity_theft,"Before you say anything, no, I know not to leave my computer sitting out logged in to all my accounts. I have it set up so after a few minutes of inactivity it automatically switches to my brother's.","Computer operating systems were initially written for the business environment. Thus they were made to be accessible to multiple employees, or users, but only fully accessible to administrators (or admins). Regular users can access and use programs on the computer, but only the admin is allowed to make changes to how the computer runs.  This same split level of security continues to this day, even in privately owned, or ""home"", computers.  The joke here is that the most important things on a computer are no longer the programs that it runs, but the private personal data it accesses (usually online). Anyone who wished to do real mischief on an active computer could do considerable damage without ever caring what the admin password was. The admin password, in effect, now guards a vault no one cares about.  This comic pokes fun at the authorization mechanisms surrounding most operating systems' administrator accounts. It makes the argument that the user's data is more valuable than the integrity of the system. This is arguably true for most personal systems, although it is probably not true in a shared-server setup, where a system compromise could lead to the exposure of many users' data.  Essentially, once a user is logged in, he or she can typically access all of his or her data without any further restriction. Modifying the operating system (for example, to install drivers) requires a separate password.  In fact, this password protection also hinders installation of malware, which is otherwise possible even remotely, with the malware then being able to e.g. steal passwords, enabling a hacker anywhere in the world to access your accounts without ever needing to touch your computer. So having your computer set up to not to ask you for an administrator's password arguably implies a bigger risk of identity theft than allowing others to access your system physically while being logged in does.  The title text alludes to the security practice where computers automatically lock the user out after a few minutes, requiring a password from the user in order to continue using it. Instead, Randall's computer automatically switches to his brother's account, presumably compromising his data instead of Randall's.","[Diagram showing several connected rooms. One in the center says ""User account on my laptop,"" surrounded by ""Dropbox,"" ""Photos & files,"" ""Facebook,"" ""Gmail,"" ""PayPal,"" and ""Bank,"" which are connected to the middle room and to each other.

1279: Reverse Identity Theft,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1279:_Reverse_Identity_Theft,identity_theft,"I asked a few friends whether they'd had this happen, then looked up the popularity of their initials/names over time. Based on those numbers, it looks like there must be at least 750,000 people in the US alone who think 'Sure, that's probably my email address' on a regular basis.","Identity theft is the criminal method of assuming the identity of an unsuspecting person, usually to get credit in their name. While this is done deliberately, the comic introduces the idea of reverse identity theft: An older person with little knowledge of computers involuntarily uses another person's email address because he or she supposed it to be their own. Since most email addresses follow a generic pattern, they simply adapt the pattern to conform with their own name, unaware that someone with the same initial and last name already owns the address.  Most internet users face at some point the message that their desired email address is ""already taken"". Because email addresses must be unique and only a limited set of characters is allowed, people with common names usually add numbers to their name. The comic suggests that elder people might easily forget that they had to take, for instance, [email protected] when they signed up. Instead, the person would tell everyone that their address was [email protected], since that follows the generic pattern and is the most intuitive assumption for them. They are in complete ignorance that the address belongs, in fact, to whomever claimed it first. In this case, the address belongs to Randall himself. (In case you're wondering, yes, [email protected] is Randall's email according to the xkcd blag.)  The comic has Cueball call an older person, who apparently gave Cueball's email address to the phone company, which now emails Cueball the bills - this could have been avoided if said company confirmed an email address first. The person is not able to understand why this is not their email address (as it corresponds with their name) and is also very confused how Cueball got their phone number. The latter reveals a major problem of reverse identity theft: Using another person's email address for your own business matters exposes your own identity. The owner of the address could easily take advantage of the situation, leading to a scenario of regular identity theft. Fortunately, Cueball seems to be more honest; Black Hat probably would not have given any warning.  Due to the sheer mass of people online, nearly all simple nicknames are already taken; and the number of possible combinations is further diminished by services (e.g., Gmail) which ignore the dot sign altogether and does not allow the use of hyphens or underscores. This policy is designed to prevent fraud, but it forces users to add numbers or other unique identifiers to their names. Apart from the scenario addressed in the comic, another subsequent problem is the use of wrong email addresses by third parties. Someone sending sensitive personal information to the wrong recipient can just as easily expose a person's identity as the person himself.  In the end, there is no practical solution to the problems arising from the uniqueness of usernames and email addresses. Instead, it is simply the consequence of naming itself: While a name was originally intended to distinguish its bearer from a limited number of people (e.g. the rest of the village), the Internet makes it necessary to distinguish ourselves from the entire rest of the world (or at least everybody online).  Note that Gmail ignores everything behind a plus sign. Like ignoring dots, this is used as a way to create email aliases. The plus sign in the formula used in the comic should therefore considered to be only an indicator for concatenation, not a literal character in the address.    Note from Editor: I have a hyphenated 1st name and 2 mid-names, and I use all of those initials then my last name.","If your email address is [First initial]+[Last name]@gmail.com you gradually get to know lots of older people who have the same name pattern  Cueball: Yes, I know it would make sense if that were your email address, but it's not.

1317: Theft,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1317:_Theft,identity_theft,"Is he ALSO wondering at what point our thoughts diverged, if they even have yet? 'dude, I think he just took your credit card' AM I THE ORIGINAL? HOW DO I TELL?","The term ""identity theft"" refers to a thief acquiring various types of a victim's identification (for example, bank account number and/or Social Security number), thus allowing the thief to pretend to be the victim and commonly steal money from the victim's bank account, etc.  This comic exaggerates the term, interpreting it as the thief literally acquiring the victim's whole personality. Like Cueball & Megan in general, the victim is implied to have some Randallian personality traits, like the love of space and existential angst. Thus, the thief is now completely overwhelmed by having an entirely new personality, not to mention one whose parts clash with each other.  The title text ponders the specifics of the identity acquisition process. Presumably, even two people whose personalities are identical would still start to think different thoughts. (This is a prerequisite for the depiction in the comic; the thief is baffled by his newly acquired interests, while the victim would not be baffled by the thoughts and interests they've developed over their entire life.) It is also wondered whether the victims new doppelganger is wondering the same thing, which could imply that their thoughts have not fully diverged. A friend comments that the victim may be overthinking the situation, and that the thief only took his credit card information. (A common method of identity theft. Does not transfer personality traits[citation needed].) However, the victim is overwhelmed by existential anxiety.","[An identity thief sits in front of a laptop, looking at his hands] Thief: I feel paralyzed by overwhelming existential dread. Thief: ...and yet for some reason I'm really excited about space? [under the panel is text that reads:] The thief who stole my identity has a lot to deal with."
77: Bored with the Internet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/77:_Bored_with_the_Internet,internet,I used to do this all the time.,"A character who has hair (not to be confused with Hairy) suggests to Black Hat that he is wasting his life on the Internet, and they should go explore the world. They appear to walk a great distance, through what appears to be a swamp or perhaps a forest in winter, across a plain, and down to a river valley. Despite traveling so far and through such varied landscapes, in the last panel, one of the characters admits that all he can think about is what a great Livejournal post their trip would make. It appears that the plan to get the Internet off their mind has failed.  Livejournal is a website on which users can make accounts and, effectively, blog, although the site is designed around the premise that the blogs ought to be used as personal journals, with the ability to privatize the journal or only let certain friends see certain entries. Livejournal was an early social network and an early blog platform, and was a good way for people to let others know what was going on in their lives. As of 2017, Livejournal still exists, although sites like Facebook and Twitter have become far more powerful and popular sites for sharing one's daily life.  Unlike most of his appearances (especially later ones), Black Hat does not exhibit any of his signature Classhole tendencies.  The title text suggests that Randall has overcome a tendency to think about how he will document what he has been doing, rather than concentrate on the thing itself.","[Black Hat and Hair are talking in a room with a computer on.] Hairy: I feel like I'm wasting my life on the internet. Let's walk around the world. Black Hat: Sounds good. [The two men are shown walking through trees.] [The two men are shown walking on flat stretch, with mountains in the distance.] [The two men are shown in a magnificent canyon. They stand, silently looking at the scene.] Hairy: And yet all I can think is, ""This will make for a great LiveJournal entry."""
86: Digital Rights Management,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/86:_Digital_Rights_Management,internet,"If you're interested in the subject, Lawrence Lessig's 'Free Culture' is pretty good","Digital rights management (DRM) is a class of methods for controlling digital files, such as by preventing media from playing on any device besides the device from which the purchase is made. It is used by several major companies, as it makes it more difficult to pirate media, which they claim cuts into their profits. Those companies typically also lobby for laws forbidding circumvention of DRM techniques, like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  However, DRM is usually disliked by consumers, as it makes it difficult to use their purchased media. For example, if they buy a new computer, there's no guarantee that their DRM-covered media will be usable on the new computer. Thus, Black Hat is suggesting to the pro-DRM organizations Sony, Microsoft, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and Apple that they stop their DRM-fiddling and lobbying, and he'll stop his inexorable ice-wall.  The title text refers readers to law professor Lawrence Lessig's book Free Culture.  There appears to be a larger version of Black Hat, drawn in pencil and erased, behind him. The smaller figure makes the inexorably advancing wall of ice appear correspondingly larger.","[Black Hat is standing on an advancing glacier] Black Hat: Dear Sony, Microsoft, the MPAA, the RIAA, and Apple: Let's make a deal. You stop trying to tell me where, when, and how I play my movies and music, and I won't crush your homes under my inexorably advancing wall of ice."
94: Profile Creation Flowchart,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/94:_Profile_Creation_Flowchart,internet,This one goes out to xxCrazyPixie1987xx,"AIM (short for AOL Instant Messenger) offered its users profile pages to share info about themselves or their friends. Randall notes that these pages fall into one of three categories:  Both AIM and LiveJournal were known for their teenage user base, as shown by the title text's fictional AIM screen name. A complete list of flowchart comics can be found here.  [A flowchart is shown.]","Have Friends? → No → Link to your LiveJournal Have Friends? → Yes, and want to alienate everyone else → Inside jokes! Have Friends? → Yes → Have Boyfriend/ Girlfriend? →  No → Angsty about it? →  Yes → Link to your LiveJournal No → Yes you are → Angsty about it?  Yes → A profile tribute is the greatest possible expression of love."
134: Myspace,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/134:_Myspace,internet,"It's like they got together and said 'what do we miss most from the internet in 1998? that's right, embedded MIDI!'","Some websites, not long after the page finishes loading, suddenly play a song. It's annoying to the person visiting the site and to others who are nearby, so it will attract a lot of unwanted attention, especially if the song is played at a loud volume. Compounding this would be the possible inappropriateness of the song that is suddenly playing.  The five seconds to stop the music (finding the ""pause""/""stop"" button, muting the computer audio...) is too long in such an incident.  Since MySpace allows wide customization for members pages, many users have embedded music players that auto-run when the page is visited.  The title text refers to the fact that old pages, back in the late 1990s, used embedded MIDI files. MIDI files may have terrible sound quality (while lossless, it is limited in the amount of sounds that can be reproduced), but, more importantly, MIDI files that are embedded in the page would not only play automatically, but also have no way to stop playing. The viewer would have to leave the website or externally mute the audio.","[Computer screen showing a myspace page.] Oh man, you and everyone in earshot are gonna love the first five seconds of this song!"
181: Interblag,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/181:_Interblag,internet,Sometimes I hate the internet. Sometimes it makes me happy that 'The Tubes' has become slang for the internet so quickly.,"The comic parodies the habit of word coining on the internet, as well as the enthusiasm for modern sounding terms in the IT world in general. Common examples include the shortening of ""weblog"" to ""blog,"" while the entirety of blogs is referred to as the ""blogosphere."" The internet itself is sometimes called ""The Tubes,"" a term derived from Senator Ted Stevens's infamous statement ""Series of Tubes."" The suffixes ""-net"" and ""-web"" are often used to denote a certain interconnection of information on the internet, as well as to make products and brands sound fit for the 21st century.  The matrix shown in the comic spoofs the internet jargon by combining common prefixes and suffixes to new and impressive but meaningless words. The culmination of nonsense is, as indicated in the transcript, the term ""blagoblag."" This is also a sideswipe at comic 148, where ""blag"" was introduced as a substitute for the usage of ""blog."" The official weblog of the xkcd webcomic was formerly called ""blag."" The prefix ""blago-,"" meanwhile, was used again in comic 239: Blagofaire.","Terms I have used or heard used to make fun of the internet: [Below: A matrix whose entries may contain crosses to indicate that a term has been used. The rows (prefixes) are labelled WORLD WIDE, INTER-, BLOGO-, BLAGO-, and WEB-; the columns are labelled NET, WEB, SPHERE, TUBES, and BLAG. In the interests of properly propagating the term ""blagoblag,"" the full list of used terms follows:] World Wide Web Internet Interweb Intersphere Intertubes Interblag Blogosphere Blagonet Blagosphere Blagoblag Webnet Webweb [Cueball and Megan stand facing; Cueball raises his hands in the air while Megan is nonplussed.] Cueball: I heard about it on the interblag!"
195: Map of the Internet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/195:_Map_of_the_Internet,internet,For the IPv6 map just imagine the XP default desktop picture.,"On the map, all allocated IPv4 address blocks (as of 2006) are shown using a fractal mapping. (The Hilbert curve is used: the pattern is demonstrated at the bottom of the image.) In February 2011, the final remaining IPv4 blocks were allocated to the Regional Internet registries, and so today there would no longer be any green spaces outside of Class E addresses (above 240 through 255, excluding the Broadcast address of 255.255.255.255).  In the early 1990s, corporations and governments could register an entire class A segment (one 256th of the total space), but later it was divided into smaller parts because of a lack of space.  This leads to the title text, which mentions IPv6. This protocol has so many addresses that only a swarm of nanobots could exhaust them (see 865: Nanobots). The default desktop picture in Windows XP is a green landscape, and the joke is that since barely any of the addresses are allocated yet, the IPv6 map would just be a green landscape.  Later, Randall actually drew some ""real"" maps of the Internet, or at least its online Communities (see 256: Online Communities and 802: Online Communities 2).","Map of the Internet The IPv4 Space, 2006 This chart shows the IP address space on a plane using a fractal mapping which preserves grouping--any consecutive string of IPs will translate to a single, compact, contiguous region on the map. Each of the 256 numbered blocks represents one  8 subnet (containing all IPs that start with that number).  The upper left section shows the blocks sold directly to corporations and goverments in the 1990's before the RIRs took over allocation.

250: Snopes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/250:_Snopes,internet,The MythBusters are even more sinister.,"Snopes is a popular website for checking the validity of urban legends. Naturally, it didn't take long for an urban legend to suggest that the proprietors of Snopes also direct a spam operation to create more urban legends and disseminate them, just so they'll continue to have an audience. One of the Cueballs tries to come to Snopes' defense, only to realize that the debunking was done by Snopes itself, creating a circular, invalid argument.  The title text suggests that MythBusters, another group that debunks myths, also participate in the practice of spreading misinformation for the opportunity to test it. Indeed, the show has occasionally been accused of spending undue attention on unnecessary filler ""myths"" just for the sake of filling out the season.  Snopes is also mentioned in the much later comic 1081: Argument Victory, in a much more positive light.","Cueball: Another urban legend? You should check out Snopes before sending me this stuff. Friend: Oops; yeah. Cueball: Man, Snopes is really great--independent fact-checkers trawling our collective discourse, filtering out misinformation. Friend: Yeah, but they have their dark side. The couple that runs snopes.com also runs a network of spam servers that start many of those forwarded stories in the first place, ensuring they'll always have business. Cueball: That's absurd. Plus, it's definitely not true--it was debunked by... Friend: Yes? Cueball: ...Oh my God."
256: Online Communities,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/256:_Online_Communities,internet,"I'm waiting for the day when, if you tell someone 'I'm from the internet', instead of laughing they just ask 'oh, what part?'","Note: This comic dates from Spring 2007. The internet changed a lot since that time. This is Randall's first map of online communities, with a successor (showing some zoomed-in highlights of the map) at 802: Online Communities 2. As Randall says on the map, the area of each ""country"" is roughly proportional to its membership, at least in 2007. Geographic location means a bit more, however, as the Compass-Rose-Shaped Island points out. North-south corresponds to a spectrum from practical to intellectual, and east-west corresponds to one from web-focused to real-life-focused. The map also bears a slight resemblance to South East Asia. Randall likes to draw maps in a manner like this. Each ""country"" is represented by size and related points of interest. We also have a ""Sea of Memes"" and a small ""Straits of WEB 2.0."" [edit]Compass Rose-shaped Island This is a joke located near the middle of the map, that nonetheless serves to organize the illustration. A Compass Rose —the name for the multi-pointed star that shows where North is on the map— appears on most maps; however, here, it's actually land that just coincidentally looks like a compass rose. The ""points"" of the island do, however, roughly organize the map. Left is ""Focus on Real Life,"" labelled ""IRL,"" an abbreviation for ""In Real Life."" Right is ""Focus on Web,"" labelled "".com."" Up is ""Practicals,"" labelled ""N,"" as in ""North,"" but with small letters making it spell ""Noob,"" slang for a ""Newbie"" or ""New user"" — a person less experienced with the internet, as many of the sites to the top of the map are ones infamous for having large numbers of largely computer-illiterate people. Down is ""Intellectuals,"" labelled ""π,"" an important constant in mathematics approximately equal to 3.14. [edit]The Icy North These are ommunities that were once major players, but now in a much reduced role. While some are still fairly large, they're somewhat relics of older times, hence the ""Mountains of Web 1.0"" that run through them — Web 1.0 is the first major generation of websites. Yahoo! was the most popular search engine around 1998, but lost out to Google. It remains in business due to diversification (it now owns Tumblr, for instance). Windows Live, particularly Windows Live Messenger, used to be a particularly major way for friends to communicate, now taken over by Skype and the like. Once a more-or-less ubiquitous branding, now used much less. https://home.live.com/ ‎is one remnant. AOL was once a huge player in the internet service provider market, noted for sending out millions of floppy disks and CD-ROMs in the 1980s and '90s offering a month or so free internet service (followed by high fees and difficult cancellation). Notably, AOL was the first company to sign up large numbers of people to internet access throughout the year, whereas before then internet was mainly provided by colleges and universities, fundamentally changing internet culture (see Eternal September). This influx of new users or ""Noobs"" (short for ""newbies"") names the Noob Sea south of AOL. The Chat Rooms nearby were a selling feature of early ISPs — ways to communicate with other people from that ISP. They are largely dying now, but were a major selling point in the early days. Classmates.com and Reunion.com are early sites that offered to help you find your former classmates from school, a role largely taken over by the big, more generalized social media sites. Classmates.com is probably best known by its memetic advertisement that said ""She married him??!! And they've got 7 kids??"" Friendster was the first big social media site. It was later outpaced by Myspace and Facebook (see Social Media below). It has survived by rebranding itself as a social gaming site, now used primarily in Southeast Asia. Qwghlm: A reference to The Baroque Cycle, a series of science fiction books by Neal Stephenson. In them, Qwghlm is a group of islands in the icy north. See http://baroquecycle.wikia.com/wiki/Qwghlm. Chasm: A barely-readable note just below the ""O"" of ""NORTH."" This may simply be a reference to a lot of fantasy series containing a chasm. (For example, the One Ring is destroyed by flinging it into a fiery chasm in The Lord of the Rings.) [edit]Dating sites (Northwest coastal regions) E-Harmony and OkCupid are dating sites; the other, larger sites near them are mostly social media sites. The Lonely Island label appears to be a joke: Surrounded by, but separate from dating sites and social media sites, it would be a rather lonely place. Possibly named after ""Tol Eressëa"" (Translation: The Lonely Island), a somewhat obscure location in J. R. R. Tolkien's books, but there are other possibilities. [edit]Social Media (West) These are sites mainly used to communicate with friends, such as Facebook and Myspace. The first large one was Friendster, but this has largely become a social gaming site primarily used in Southeast Asia, as discussed in The Icy North, above. Other social media sites listed are: Faceparty: A UK social media site started in 1999. Myspace: A social media site partially owned by, of all people, Justin Timberlake. Started in 2003, and peaking around the time this comic was made, it nonetheless still remains popular for bands (hence ""Myspace Bands"" in the southwest). It was never known for having a particularly attractive web design (partly because users could extensively customize the look and feel of their profile pages), hence only a very small part of it labelled ""Attractive Myspace Pages."" The Series of Tubes: A reference to an internet meme. In 2006, U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, while arguing for the end of ""Network neutrality,"" a concept that keeps ISPs from favouring or charging more for high-speed access to sites, claimed that such regulation was needed because the Internet was ""not a truck"" you could just load up with as much as you want, but a ""series of tubes."" This was fairly accurate, but his arguments were poor and badly phrased, and his speech subsequently received widespread derision (originally from Jon Stewart's The Daily Show), and it became a running gag on the internet. Facebook: Generally considered (at least in the West) the ""modern"" social media network, and the most popular. However, this comic is from 2007, and Facebook did not catch up to Myspace until 2008-2009. [Source: Myspace] Orkut: A social media network launched in 2004 by Google, it became hugely popular in Brazil, India, and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Xanga: A blogging and social media site launched in 1998. LJ: LiveJournal, a blogging site, more or less, but one that allows an internet forum-like structure where anyone, or selected people, can all start new posts on a community. Noted for a large number of teenagers, fanfic authors, and the like in its heyday, hence the ""Bay of Angst"" to its south. Blurty: LiveJournal's software is Open Access, meaning anyone can use it to set up a site. Blurty is, according to Wikipedia, an 18+ general community using this software. Cyworld: A South Korean social media site featuring avatars and ""mini-rooms."" [edit]The Blogipelago (Southwest) This is a portmanteau of blog and archipelago. Sulawesi is a real island in the Indonesian archipelago, implying that this region's similarity to Indonesia is probably intentional. Huffington Post: The Huffington Post is a web-only news site, named after its founder, Arianna Huffington. It's noted for attracting notable people to do very good write-ups of politics and news, generally with a liberal slant, but also for having a medicine section that supports every sort of quackery and nonsense, including a regular column by Dana Ullman promoting homeopathy (see 765: Dilution). Shipwreck of the SS Howard Dean: In the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, Howard Dean raised funds mainly over the internet, and was doing very well, until a gaffe caused him to crash and burn just before the primaries began. See Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004. Cory Doctrow's Balloon: Reference to 239: Blagofaire. Boing Boing: An occasional trend is for a smallish magazine to get a website, have the website become vastly more popular than its print edition, and become a successful website. Examples include Cracked.com, The Onion, and the subject of this label, Boing Boing. Boing Boing is a group blog covering technology, intellectual property, science fiction, and futurism. Technorati: A site for searching blogs. Sulawesi: As mentioned above, a real island that is part of the Indonesian archipelago. Xu Jinglei: A Chinese actress. According to Wikipedia: ""In mid-2006, her Chinese-language blog had the most incoming links of any blog in any language on the Internet, according to Technorati."" PostSecret: A website that people send postcards to, describing their secrets. Some are little secrets (like swigging milk directly from the jug or carton), some are old, deep-seated traumas, and some are just things that they could never admit to anyone publicly. Worth a look. The Wet Sea: Perhaps a reference to a West Sea, but not sure what that would be. Maybe just a simple joke, as what else would a sea be but wet? TWB or TMZ: A very-hard-to-read label, south of Technorati. TWB is short for ""Translators Without Borders,"" a charitable project that tries to translate necessary texts into the languages of the people who need them for free. This might be it, if it's meant to relate to Wikipedia, to the east of it. On the other hand, TMZ is a major celebrity gossip blog, rated #15 in the ""World's 50 most powerful blogs"" by The Guardian, and, at time of writing, rating #11 in the Technorati top 100. [edit]Sea of Culture (Central region) Sites for sharing and showing off music and images, most focusing on self-created content. Gulf of YouTube: YouTube is the definitive video website where people can upload videos with the purpose of public viewing, ranging from home movies through official music videos through Let's Plays of people playing video games to questionably-legal uploads of cartoons and films. Google has since purchased YouTube. Piczo: Teen-oriented website that allowed one to make a profile and put up pictures. The site has been dead since late 2012, due to the rise of Facebook. See Piczo. Broadcaster: Another dead site, almost lost to the web. Only a few scraps of information remain on the web. One of the rare scraps of remaining information indicates that it was a webcam broadcasting service that also allowed YouTube-like sharing of videos. The Bit Torrent and the P2P Shoals: Reference to file sharing (passing around often copyright-infringing files, such as movies, CDs, and the like), often done with the BitTorrent protocol. A ""Torrent"" can also be a flood of water, hence it being used to name a river. ""P2P"" stands for ""Peer-to-peer"", the basis for the BitTorrent protocol. Flickr: a website where people can upload and share photographs they took. LastFM: a music website that is notable of its ""scrobbling"" feature. DeviantArt: the largest art website, where people can upload, sell, and buy not only art itself, but also video, audio, Flash-work, and even skins (the original purpose of deviantArt). While many big-name/professional people and organizations have their works in deviantArt, the site is more infamous for the large amount of people who upload low-quality fan-art and fan-characters, most notably of media from Japan. Another point of infamy is the large amount of drama that can happen in the website. Straits of Web 2.0: A strait is a narrow passage between two outcroppings. Web 2.0 is a term used to describe new internet architectures, which these programs and Wikipedia (the other side of the strait) are examples of. Gays of Web 2.0 is a pun: The opposite of a gay person (homosexual) is a straight person (heterosexual). [edit]User-created content and discussions (Southeast) Sites such as Wikipedia and chat programs such as IRC. Wikipedia: The world's largest encyclopedia, collaboratively edited by its users. It's labelled as ""The Wikipedia Project"" (actually called Wikimedia), since Wikipedia has generalised to cover a number of separate web sites, though, at the time of this comic, none near the size of Wikipedia (excepting, possibly, Wikimedia Commons, which is partly an image repository for Wikipedia), perhaps explaining the small size of all the other vertexes of the ""web."" Usenet: The predecessor of most modern forums. A set of discussion groups that dominated the early internet. It also predates the standard web architecture to some extent — there's no standard weblink for it, for instance. See Usenet. IRC isles: IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, a simple, low-bandwidth program for chatting. Common uses include Dungeons and Dragons games and other geeky pursuits. SourceForge: A code repository. Basically, a place for programmers to meet up and work together on a variety of free and open source projects. See sourceforge. Has become less respectable since this comic was created in 2007, due to allowing misleading advertisements intended to trick people into installing questionable software. MIT: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the most respected universities for Engineering, Robotics, and other such fields. Engadget: A blog/online magazine, in multiple languages, reviewing tech products and commenting on technology news. Gizmodo: A blog about technology and design. MakeBlog: A blog highlighting bizarre and interesting do-it-yourself projects, often with a geeky theme. Google's Volcano Fortress: A volcano fortress is one traditional dwelling place of evil geniuses in fiction, and Google has quietly taken over huge chunks of people's interaction with the web. Perhaps this provides some background for 254: Comic Fragment? Stallman's Airship: A joke, perhaps in line with Cory Doctorow's Balloon (239: Blagofaire, also referenced in this strip) [edit]Ocean of Subculture and Sea of Memes (East) Need descriptions Sites related to smaller internet communities, a.k.a. ""Subcultures."" Also, a whole lot of internet memes, unsurprisingly. The ""Viral Straits"" references the idea of something ""going viral,"" i.e. spreading quickly to huge numbers of people on the internet. These sites are often responsible for things going viral, and the memes listed are ones that went viral in the past. Sites 2Channel: a Japanese imageboard that was actually the original inspiration for... 4Chan: an imageboard in which people can upload pictures, while others comment on them. The website is infamous for its loose/often non-existent rules, incredibly vulgar userbase, source of new memes, and spawning of trolls. 4chan's random board, known internally as /b/, is almost constantly flooded with porn and image macros. The fact that 4chan is a very small island on this map (to the far right on the map - left of ""dragons"" in the sentence Here there be anthropomorphic dragons) made quite a fuss for Randall. And this caused the comic to be mentioned in FRUIT OPINIONS! on the Blag. Although this comic was one of the more controversial, it had nothing on the impact of 388: Fuck Grapefruit, which was the cause of the Blag entry as that became the most controversial comic written to that point (i.e. 2008): ...beating out comics about cunnilingus, the Obama endorsement, and my making 4chan tiny on the map of the internet. (See the grapefruit comic for more details). Reddit: the self-described ""front page of the Internet"" in which users submit stories, photos, and videos, and the best are ""up-voted"" to the top of the page. Digg: a former competitor to Reddit in the social-news sphere, but has been sold since this map was drawn and restarted as an aggregator of news stories. Fark: A website that writes humorous commentary on various news reports, especially the strange, bizarre, or things from the political far-left and far-right. Something Awful: a website that is meant to showcase all things ""awful."" SomethingAwful also has a large trollbase, but they tend to be more honorable than the ones from Encyclopedia Dramatica and 4chan. One example is there being a spotty holding of the no-furries rule in the forums. The forums themselves are famous because of the holding of the ""Let's Plays"" of Dangan Ronpa and Super Dangan Ronpa 2, which had cooked up public interest to the point of there being an English-language release of the games. /.: Slashdot, a news site for technology-related news stories, which are submitted by its users. The ""Slashdot effect"" is named after this site. YTMND: a community in which users can create meme-type nonsense by playing music over an image (either static or animated). Its name is an acronym for ""You're The Man Now, Dog!"" Stumble Upon: A website that attempts to develop a profile for users in order to recommend which websites they might enjoy. Del.icio.us: Another image and website aggregator, linking to various things of interest. It uses tags to let people find specific types of content. (Note: Since this comic, this website was renamed as ""Delicious."") Memes and related Isle of Slash: ""Slash fiction"" is a type of fanfiction that takes two male characters from another work of fiction and puts them in a plot where they have lots of sex with each other. Named because of a common way of writing pairings in fanfiction, ""X/Y"", with the / being pronounced ""slash."" Adding to this, ""Isle of"" sounds like ""I love."" Numa: A reference to the viral video ""Numa Numa,"" consisting of a man dancing and lip-syncing to the song ""Dragostea din tei"" (Romanian for ""Love from the lindens""). Your Base: A reference to the ""All your base are belong to us"" meme, a line from the game Zero Wing, a game with a huge amount of hilariously badly translated Engrish dialogue. See 286: All Your Base for more discussion of the meme. Bay of Trolls: Trolls are people who attempt to stir up controversy by intentionally saying statements meant to annoy others into responding. ""Bay"" can refer to both a sheltered port and to an animal's cry, so ""Bay of Trolls"" can be read as ""Shelter for Trolls"" or ""Angry Shouting of Trolls."" Given the communities surrounding it, both would make sense. Soviet Russia: ""In Soviet Russia"" jokes are a style of joke commonly associated with -comedian Yakov Smirnoff, which has since become an internet meme. Example: ""In America, you always find a party. In Russia, Party will always find you."" — playing off of the idea that ""Party"" can also refer to the Communist Party. The meme version usually isn't as clever as that, though. See ""in soviet russia."" SPAAARTA: As in, ""THIS! IS! SPAAARTA!!!"", a famously over-the-top line from the movie 300.

The label ""Here there be anthromorphic dragons"" references a common marking on old maps (""Here there be dragons"") but updates it to joke about the more humanoid dragons seen in many games, or again, how dragons, especilally anthropomorphic dragons, are very-very popular in the furry community. Yahoo Games: A branch of Yahoo (see ""The Icy North"") dedicated to games (mainly boardgames). UO: Ultima Online, one of the first MMORPGs, and the first to grow to any size. Based on the long-running Ultima RPG computer games. Started 1997. EQ: EverQuest, another important early MMORPG, started 1999. UO and EQ have declined significantly since then; for a while, they were each the iconic MMORPG, but that role has been taken over by... WoW: World of Warcraft, an MMORPG launched in 2004, again based on a previously-existing RPG series, and by far the largest and most iconic at the time of this comic's creation. A few others have attempted to challenge it since. Runescape: Free-to-play fantasy MMORPG; the largest in existence. FFXI: Final Fantasy XI, the eleventh installment in the Final Fantasy series of video games, and the first to be a MMORPG. It didn't really take off until after this comic was made. Lineage: 1998 MMORPG. Particularly popular in South Korea, a country with somewhat of a cultural obsession with video games. Second Life: A virtual world, noted for largely working from user-generated content, which can be sold by users for real money. See Second Life. Third Life is a joke based on Second Life — if it existed, it would presumably be a game people play to escape Second Life, which they play to escape their first, real life.","[Hand-drawn fantasy style map with land and sea areas representing populations of online communities.

262: IN UR REALITY,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/262:_IN_UR_REALITY,internet,"Hey, at least I ran out of staples.","The LOLcat meme genre involves pictures of cats in various poses and facial contortions accompanied by deliberately misspelled captions. Black Hat claims to be from the Internet and is thus creating LOLcat memes by literally gluing captions to Cueball's cats.  The title text suggests that Black Hat is using glue only because he ran out of staples; fortunately for the cats in the picture, glue is much less painful than a staple. The title is also a reference to the ""I'm in ur base killing ur d00dz"" catchphrase from real-time-strategy games and The Staple Madness.",[Black Hat is holding a cat and a piece of paper.

274: With Apologies to The Who,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/274:_With_Apologies_to_The_Who,internet,"Trivia: Roger Daltry originally wrote ""Don't try an' Digg what we all say"" but erased the second ""g"" when he moved to reddit.","This comic refers to the song ""My Generation"" by the British rock band The Who, which was released in 1965. The song is about intergenerational conflict and has been regarded as a very decided proclamation of youthful rebellion. Cueball adapts the lyrics to describe his own generation, the Millennials. As people born from the 1980s onwards grew up with the internet, this generation is also nicknamed ""digital natives."" It is therefore natural that the updated lyrics should refer to blogging and internet slang. The actions performed by Cueball while typing the text relate to the original music video, in which The Who smash their instruments in true rock star fashion. Cueball wails his keyboard like a guitar and smashes his monitor in the end.  The title text jokingly suggests that the band's lead singer Roger Daltrey originally meant the line  as a reference to the social news site Digg, but changed it after switching to its competitor Reddit.  The song was actually written by guitarist Pete Townshend  ""Daltrey"" is mis-spelled.  An explanation of the terms in this comic:  The original lyrics of the song run as follows:","[Cueball is sitting at a desk with a computer, typing.] Monitor: People try to shut us d-d-down  just 'cause our music gets around [Cueball is standing on his chair and typing with his keyboard across his hip.] Monitor: Old folks act like total noobs get off our net; you block the tubes [Cueball is really wailing on the keyboard.] Monitor: Why don't you all just d-d-disconnect and don't try an' grok our d-d-dialect [Cueball smashes the keyboard into the monitor.] Monitor: I'm not tryin' to cause a big s-s-sensation  I'm just bloggin' 'bout my generation"
286: All Your Base,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/286:_All_Your_Base,internet,The AYB retro-return-date (Zero Wing Zero Hour) should be around AD 2021.,"The comic refers to a popular internet phenomenon (meme) called ""all your base are belong to us"". This catchphrase originates from the arcade shooter ""Zero Wing"" and is a popular example of a poor translation into the English language. The phrase was popularised throughout the Internet and referenced in various images and videos. It is considered one of the earliest Internet memes, with the first occurrences dating back to the year 1998.  Cueball has, according to the comic, participated in the spread of the meme during its heyday. Ponytail wonders at his keeping the content he created years ago, as the meme's popularity has massively decreased since then. Cueball answers that this was always his favourite meme, and that he is waiting for the day it gets revived. His second to last line, ""What you say!!"" is a line from the game as well, although he says it much sooner than its supposed return to popularity.  By using the example of internet memes, the comic also relates to the general principle of fashion that everything once popular will, after a long enough time, be again in vogue. Trends experiencing this renaissance are often referred to as retro. Internet phenomenon can be observed to follow the same rule, although with much shorter intervals due to the speed of information turnover.  The title text prophesies the return of the ""all your base"" meme in 2021 (similar-sounding to ""AD 2101,"" the date mentioned at the beginning of the game). It also contains a pun on the term ""zero hour"" and the name of the game which initially brought the phrase into fashion.","[A section of a Linux terminal window is shown.] Text from window:  [Ponytail is at computer.] Ponytail: What's with the All Your Base stuff? Didn't that die like five years ago? [From off-panel]: Yes.  [Cueball enters panel.] Cueball: It was my first internet meme, and my favorite. Others tired of it, but I never did. Cueball: So I wait.  [Cueball raises his fists.] Cueball: Someday, decades from now, people will have forgotten. It will be fresh again. Cueball: Retro. Cueball: And when that day comes,  Cueball: I WILL BE READY! Ponytail: You need a hobby or something. Cueball: What you say!! Cueball: Wait, too soon."
352: Far Away,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/352:_Far_Away,internet,Sometimes an impulsive 2:00 AM cross-country trip is the only solution.,"Cueball and Megan are in a long-distance relationship; in order to overcome the distance which separates them, they're keeping in touch with an instant messenger. Because their contact is limited to text, they have to write out the actions they wish to enact. Cueball is frustrated with the limitations of these place-holding phrases and longs for physical contact, going so far as to imagine himself hugging Megan in the messenger window.  In the title text, Cueball suggests that, sometimes, the only way to end his frustration is to travel across the country and see her face-to-face.","[Cueball hugging Megan in the messenger window.] Cueball: Meh. Cueball: Some nights, typing ""*hug*"" just doesn't cut it."
380: Emoticon,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/380:_Emoticon,internet,"U+FDD0 is actually Unicode for the eye of the basilisk, though for safety reasons no font actually renders it.","A basilisk is a legendary creature reputed to have the power to kill with a single glance. In this comic, Cueball learns much to his dismay that the basilisk's power is fully compatible with the 21st century, and can kill you just with a smiley emoticon over instant messaging.  Cueball's request for A/S/L is a standard question when first meeting someone online; it asks for age, sex (gender) and location.  The title text mentions U+FDD0, which in reality is the code for a ""non-character"" in Unicode.  U+FDD0 did in fact kill at least one chat client at the time. Konversation in particular. (and presumably any other Qt-based chat clients using QTextDocument)  ""basically u+fdd0 (eye of basilisk, the snake) is in a char range that's marked for interchange and illegal in utf-8""  ""but qt's utf-8 encoder let it through anyway""  ""but it just so happens that qt's qtextdocument uses u+fdd0 as text frame delimiter""  ""so when you append it to a qtd, counters run wrong and eventually you crash""  ""d-bus closes the connection and crashes the client when it encounters illegal utf-8, and kde's notification system works through d-bus""  The problem was fixed after the xkcd ""report"" and Konversation now handles unicode normally.","[Cueball sits at computer, typing.] ~!~ Opening Chat with BSLSK05 <NICKM> Hi! <NICKM> A/S/L? <BSLSK05> :) [Cueball looks stunned, flies backward.] [Two smaller frames focus in on BSLSK05's emoticon, implying rotation to show a smile and two open eyes.] [Cueball at computer slouches in chair, dead, crossbones above his head.] [At the remote computer a basilisk is looking at its screen.]"
386: Duty Calls,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/386:_Duty_Calls,internet,What do you want me to do? LEAVE? Then they'll keep being wrong!,"Cueball, and many Internet nerds, feel an irrepressible urge to correct people on the Internet, and often get intensely invested in arguments over mundane or insignificant topics. In this comic, Cueball is presented as an exaggerated example of one such arguer.  His statement that ""This is important"" shows his excessive investment in whatever [unnamed] topic he is arguing about.  Additionally, Cueball's interpretation of the argument as ""someone is wrong, I need to correct them"" rather than ""someone disagrees with me, I should learn from them"" parodies internet arguers' insistence in the obvious, objective superiority of their viewpoint.  The title text reinforce this satire.  The phrase ""Duty Calls"" used in the title is traditionally used in much more dramatic contexts [say, by a police officer, firefighter, doctor, etc. when talking about their job], so applying it to the job of arguing on the internet is a humorous mismatch that puts Cueball's disproportionate investment into perspective. Cueball's exasperated, all-or-nothing retort ""What do you want me to do? LEAVE?"" in the alt text further highlights the absurd nature of his emotional investment in this argument.  His reasoning that ""they'll keep being wrong!"" if he leaves suggests that the only solution he sees is to continue to argue until everyone on the internet has agreed with him on all issues–a ridiculously impossible plan.  By taking this satire to its logical conclusion–an eternity of arguing on the internet with no time for pleasure in real life–Randall reminds the reader that getting emotionally involved in internet arguments at the expense of real life is a terrible, terrible idea.  In 955: Neutrinos another incarnation of Cueball is cured of a similar disease. A much later comic is simply called 1731: Wrong, but here it is not the other people who are wrong!",[Cueball is behind a computer.] Voice outside frame: Are you coming to bed? Cueball: I can't. This is important. Voice: What? Cueball: Someone is WRONG on the internet.
438: Internet Argument,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/438:_Internet_Argument,internet,It's easier to be an asshole to words than to people.,"Since the first time the internet made possible to have sustained conversations with people in remote locations, it was found that most people tend to use harsh language in these conversations much more often than they would with regular spoken face-to-face conversations. This effect is similar to what happens when people drive a car: they're much more likely to get exasperated or angry at other drivers than they would when not driving.  Also, some people collectivelly known as Trolls find it funny to disrupt other people's conversations in internet forums, posing as innocent speakers. Examples of this can be entering a conversation between cancer patients suggesting the use of some ""miracle"" cure, or just asking simple, obvious questions and then pretending to not understand the answers. Most probably, trolls wouldn't have this behavior if they were speaking to a group of people in real life. A similar concept is Wikiterrorism, where someone intentionally includes false information in Wikipedia to see how long it lasts before someone notices.  In the first two panels, Cueball is  having some harsh words and probably insults with another troll. Megan takes hold of Cueball and flies him to the other one, so they see each other face to face. In this situation, they both remain silent as none of them find anything to say to the other.  When Megan returns Cueball to his original computer, both keep their conversation, but without the insults.  The title text just summarizes the whole idea into a single sentence.",[Cueball is typing profanities into his computer.] [Friend is typing profanities into his computer.] [Megan floats in behind Cueball.] [Megan lifts Cueball.] [They are flying over mountains.] [Megan and Cueball are floating in front of the friend and his computer.] [She sets Cueball down in front of the friend and his computer.] [Megan lifts Cueball again.] [They are flying.] [Megan sets Cueball down in his chair at his computer.] [Cueball is typing at his computer.] [Friend is typing at his computer.]
466: Moving,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/466:_Moving,internet,We need a special holiday to honor the countless kind souls with unsecured networks named 'linksys'.,"The caption notes that few forces are more powerful than a geek trying to get Internet in a new apartment. Thus explaining the title of the comic: Moving.  A cantenna is a do-it-yourself antenna made from a can, in this case a pringles can. Cueball is pointing his cantenna to the neighbors across the road, which, as he says, will allow him to connect to the wifi network there.  Megan points out that the neighbors themselves don't have internet access, to which Cueball answers that he thinks that the neighbors will get hooked up to the internet first.  The title text continues this theme of connecting to other people's networks, noting that we should have a holiday in honour of those people who don't bother reconfiguring their Linksys routers (thus leaving them with the default name of 'linksys'; this was very common when this comic was published in 2008), which allows other people to connect to those networks very easily, as they aren't encrypted by default and don't need a password.","[Caption above the panel:] There are few forces more powerful than geeks desperately trying to get internet in a new apartment. [Cueball is pointing an empty can out the open window. It is placed on a moving box and lots of small parts are lying on the floor in the otherwise empty room. Megan stand behind him with a laptop in one hand] Cueball: Okay, the pringles cantenna has let us patch into the WiFi network across the road. Megan: And they have internet? Cueball: No, but I think the cable van will hook up their house first."

The one-minute preview, unofficially nicknamed ""2 Girls 1 Cup,"" is a viral video that became a well-known internet meme. It is therefore not surprising that only the input combination of x=2 and y=1 generates a significant number of search results, being 257 times as frequent as the runner-up, ""1 Girl 1 Cup.""  The cells in the table with zero hits are white. From 1 to 9 they are yellow, and above that they are orange - except the maximum, which is red. As the second largest count is below 10,000 (7503) and the maximum almost two million, it is impossible to say if the red color is reserved for the maximum or for any number above a given value, say from ten thousand or up to above a million hits.  The title text suggests other combinations like 1 girl to 10,000 cups (very large number of cups to one girl), 2 girls to (5+3i) cups (a complex number), 65536 girls to 65536 cups (216, the first integer that can't be represented as a two-byte unsigned integer), and finally 3 French hens and 2 turtle doves to 1 cup. All are phrases with apparently no search results.   The last phrase is a reference to the song The Twelve Days of Christmas. After the publication of this comic, the phrase has been cross-posted at various sites in order to generate search results and prove the statement in the title text wrong. The same has happened to other entries, as often happens shortly after Randall posts something regarding Google searches.","Google results for ""<x> cups <y> girls"" [There is a table with eight columns and eight rows. The cells are colored depending on the value in the cell.] [Above the tabel is the label for the columns:]  Cups  [To the left the label for the rows:] Girls [The number of cups and girls are not part of the cells in the table, but they have been included here below - also [Girls] is written only for clarity.]"
494: Secretary: Part 1,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/494:_Secretary:_Part_1,internet,The blueprints for the Department of the Internet offices call for Ceiling Cat-themed sprinkler heads.,"The President of the United States of America is the chief executive of the United States of America. Since this comic was released in October 2008 and the presidential election was in November, it was then unknown which of the candidates would become president by the time the comic was set (Spring 2009). This is why the president in the comic is out-of-panel and therefore not revealed to us. As it would turn out, the president inaugurated in January 2009 was Barack Obama, who has gone on to demonstrate a tactical use of the Internet (including the more frivolous aspects of it) for public relations purposes. The suppositional president in the comic is less savvy.  The tubes being clogged is a reference to the, now deceased, Alaska Senator Ted Stevens who, during a congressional debate on net neutrality described the Internet as a series of tubes (be sure to listen to the audio clips in that Wikipedia page, and you'll see why he became a big hit with the Internet). Ted Stevens also gained notoriety for backing a proposal to build a bridge to nowhere using federal funds. The question ""What are they a-Twitter about now?"" refers to the website Twitter, which is a microblogging and social networking site.  Cats are notorious for being hard to herd, thus the idiom ""herding cats"" meaning an extremely difficult task that can very quickly get away from anyone undertaking it. Lolcats are pictures of cats, usually in humorous poses, that have insipid captions on them. The conflation of lolcats and the herding idiom escaped the president (who is presumably somebody not familiar with the former term). The title text refers to Ceiling Cat, a lolcat parody of God.  As with cats, Bloggers are an ideologically diverse bunch, and are hard to get to go in a single direction.  The proposed ""Secretary of the Internet"" would likely be a new position on the President's Cabinet, which currently consists of the heads of 15 executive departments and are, with the one exception of the Attorney General (who heads the Department of Justice), titled ""Secretary of Department"".  All comics in the Secretary series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  It is possible that this series is a continuation of 493: Actuarial, in which Black Hat demonstrates great power over even Internet trolls via his sociopathic ways. This would explain why Black Hat was chosen as Internet secretary.","Spring 2009— The new president faces a crisis... [Cueball is talking to an unseen Mr. President, who is sitting behind a desk.] Cueball: Mr. President, the bloggers are restless. Mr. President: What are they a-twitter about now?  Cueball: It's the tubes sir. They're clogged. We put too much stuff on them.  Mr. President: How bad is it? Cueball: The internet could be inoperative within days.  Cueball: We can't let a crucial resource go unshepherded. Mr. President: Go on.  Cueball: I recommend you appoint a Secretary of the internet. Someone to impose some orders on this mess.  Mr. President: Ordering bloggers around? Doesn't sound easy. Cueball: No; it's like herding lolcats. Mr. President: What? Cueball: Nothing.  Mr. President: Do you have someone in mind for the post?

495: Secretary: Part 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/495:_Secretary:_Part_2,internet,That helmet won't save him.,"Whenever something big happens the news media likes to have at least two things: interviews with people that are the news, and on-the-scene reporters. In this case Blondie as a news anchor is shown to begin with talking about Black Hat and she has even been out at his house. Even if those reporters are simply standing in front of a building that something happened in, they have to be on-scene. To thwart the media (and probably everyone else), Black Hat has built a moat around his apartment building. The second reporter is on-the-scene from the Internet, or rather, one of its darkest corners: 4chan. In more detail, 4chan is a collection of image boards, which act somewhat like forums, where users go to share images. The different boards are named by their ""folder"" structure, for lack of a better term. Therefore, the name /b/ comes from its URL: 4chan.org/b/. Pronounced ""slash bee"" (because the second forward slash is not necessary), /b/ is the ""random"" board, where anything goes, where anything is the superset of all sets, as in anything. Absolutely. Anything. As in, going more than two seconds without seeing pornographic content or hateful slurs is almost unheard of. /b/ is also the one that gets the most publicity, because it has started most of the memes [1] on the Internet, as well as the birthplace of Anonymous. The chaotic nature of the forums explains why the title text suggests that the reporter isn't safe, even though he is wearing a helmet. In fact, a goofy helmet like that is liable to get the trolls on him faster than if he didn't have it.  Ron Paul is a man who is currently a U.S. Representative for Texas. At the time the comic was published, he was running, for the second time, for President of the United States.  A haberdasher is a person who sells small articles of clothing that have been or can be sewed. In modern English a haberdashery (where a haberdasher would work) is a place that sells hats.  Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign did, in fact, use a blimp which was named the Ron Paul Blimp. However, despite their elegant appearance, blimps are not a very fast way to travel.  The images on the board behind the reporter are: The Fonz, /b/, a CD, and Epic Fail Guy, spelling out ABCDEFG.  The title text states that the second reporter (Tom)'s helmet won't help him, though from what, it is unclear as he himself stated he wasn't sure why he was wearing the helmet.  All comics in the Secretary series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  It is possible that this series is a continuation of 493: Actuarial, in which Black Hat demonstrates great power over even Internet trolls via his sociopathic ways. This would explain why Black Hat was chosen as Internet secretary.","[Blondie as a news anchor sitting behind a desk is reading from a paper she holds in her hands.

512: Alternate Currency,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/512:_Alternate_Currency,internet,"For the first time ever, the phrase 'I'd like to thank everyone at 4chan for making me successful and happy' is uttered.","Cueball is shown watching television, where it is announced that the US dollar has collapsed and been replaced by an 'alternative currency' of humorous pictures commonly shared on the internet. Such a currency would be utterly useless; for untraceable and easily counterfeited .gif and .jpeg files to become more monetarily stable than the US dollar would mean that the economy is all kinds of screwed, to the point of utter absurdity.  The title text pokes fun at users of 4Chan who are notoriously known for their habit of hoarding image macros, a practice he suggests is almost useless except in the instance jokingly suggested by the comic. 4Chan is also reputable for reducing the Happiness and Success of many people their community targets anonymously.  Randall also pokes fun at himself in saying ""I have been preparing for this moment my whole life"", indirectly implying he is also guilty of this practice.  The ""rare pepe"" meme that has recently sprouted on 4chan implies that some photoshopped pictures of Pepe the frog are valuable and that they could be sold. 120 Rare pepe's reached a price of $99,166 on eBay before being removed. [citation needed]","Television: With the collapse of the dollar, the government has endorsed an alternative currency. Your monetary worth is now determined by the number of funny pictures saved to your hard drive.  Caption reads: I have been preparing for this moment my whole life."
553: Pirate Bay,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/553:_Pirate_Bay,internet,We find you guilty of closing your torrents as soon as they finish. Your sentence is unremovable Hungarian subtitles on everything.,"The Pirate Bay is an Internet website dedicated to facilitating Bittorrent downloads of popular media. The site's servers were taken down, briefly, and the operators were taken to court in Sweden, back in 2009.  Unlike normal downloads, files downloaded via Bittorrent are not stored on any web server, but instead transferred in small pieces by other people torrenting the same file; these other people are called ""peers."" Bittorrent allows websites to provide downloads without using up disk space or bandwidth serving up the entire file; instead, they can host smaller torrent files, which simply describe what the finished file should look like and a few ""tracker"" servers where lists of other peers can be found, and the peers themselves handle all of the bandwidth issues. This approach is used by a number of websites for completely legal downloads (it's popular among smaller game companies providing digital downloads, for instance), but it's mainly associated with piracy.  However, Bittorrent depends on peers actually having the file blocks that you need. People who have already downloaded the entire file, but continue to connect to the network solely to provide that file to others, are called ""seeds,"" and they are an essential part of a healthy torrent. General etiquette demands that people should continue to seed a file until the ratio of data uploaded to data downloaded exceeds 1, although many people feel that one's ratio should be much higher. In any case, closing your torrents as soon as they finish, as mentioned in the title-text, is extremely bad etiquette, so it is punished with nuisance subtitles. This punishment was likely chosen because finding correct and well timed subtitles, in whatever language, for a pirated show tends to be quite hard sometimes.  This comic is essentially a pun on this second meaning of the word ""peer"" - in the US court system, a ""jury of your peers"" means a jury composed of everyday people like you, while the Pirate Bay operators interpret it to mean a jury composed of people who they've shared files with in the past. The Cueball that does the talking, and thus is the prodigy of the comic, feels that his approach would give him lenience in the trial, since he has always seeded well, thus ensured those peers had a good downloading experience.  The title text shows what punishment this kind of peer group would make if they find you guilty - unremovable subtitles in Hungarian. Many pirated videos originate from countries where no dubbed version is available in the regional language, so the only way to understand what's being said is by applying subtitles. These videos are then uploaded with subtitles still included, causing consternation among downloaders who can understand the spoken words but not the subtitles. Annoying Hungarian subtitles are just an example for a language most people don't understand. Finnish, Czech, or Polish wouldn't be better.","[Caption above the frame:] Awaiting the judges' ruling at the Pirate Bay trial.  [4 Cueball-like guys in a cell: 3 sitting down on a bench and one is standing, presumably looking at the fence.] Cueball: I wish this were in America. Cueball-like guy: Why?

573: Parental Trolling,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/573:_Parental_Trolling,internet,They'll pick music and culture that they know annoys you. Building in behavioral easter eggs is a fair retaliation!,"Set in the future, a daughter approaches her father playing a music video of Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"". The daughter insults her father's generation's versions of playing pranks, specifically Rickrolling. The daughter refers to this as ""trolling"" (part of the comics title), which is popular jargon for trying to disrupt a person or community via an action to elicit an emotional response. The humour is in that the dad reveals he has 'trolled' his daughter by creation a reaction in which her speech centres would shut down when she gets upset, thus eliciting an emotional response which perfectly displays his prank. This would not be possible in real life unless he messed with her brain which would be dangerous and illegal.[citation needed]  In this comic, the girl holds an ultra-thin tablet, a futuristic technology when released, a year before the release of the iPad. It also shows a curved computer monitor and keyboard, which seem to float above the desk.  The title text refers to the conflict between teenagers and adults over music and culture, with teenagers often listening to music which annoys their parents. 'Easter egg' is a term used to describe a hidden inside joke or feature inside software. Here, the daughter has been treated like a piece of software by her father Cueball. He states that since the kids on purpose chooses music and culture that they know annoys their parents, it is a fair retaliation to build in such Easter egg responses. Many people would probably disagree on this, but maybe not so much parents with teenagers at home...  ""Teehee"" could also be a reference to NigaHiga's YouTube channel.","[In a frame crossing the top border of the first panel of the comic:] The future  [Cueball is sitting at a futuristic desktop computer with the curved screen and keyboard both floating above the table, and a girl with pigtails is standing behind him with a portable ultra-thin screen.

591: Troll Slayer,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/591:_Troll_Slayer,internet,We have met the enemy and he is us.,"Stephenie Meyer is the author of the Twilight novels, a series of vampire novels popular with young teens. It is a love it or hate it type of novel, with a large following and a large portion of haters as well.  In the comic, 4chan, an imageboard, is featured. Imageboards such as 4chan have the feature to post anonymously. The users of 4chan launch an attack on a Twilight board and Stephenie Meyer asks them to stop. When they refuse, Meyer writes 4chan into her next novel, thereby drawing in a large number of fans of her novel as a counter-attack to what 4chan ran on the Twilight forum. This results in what the original 4chan users consider a ruined imageboard (not that this plan would have any chance of success in the real 4chan, but there's the joke as presented).  The title of the comic is drawn from the internet slang term troll, which refers to actively attempting to get a rise out of a forum. In this instance, 4chan attempted to troll a Twilight board and Meyer acted against the troll, making her a ""slayer"" of them. Obviously the pimpled boy she chats with is very dismayed by this result, as there are now so many more vampire-book-fans than computer geeks on 4chan, and they cannot get through with any of their funny/evil plans anymore. There may also be a reference to the famous vampire slayer known as Buffy, seeing that Stephenie's main character vampires do not need to be slain, but she then turns on those who tries to do so in real life on the message board.  The pictures used on the two panels showing the 4chan imageboard tells a lot about their users. It is unclear what the text page refers to. And also what it is that Cueball is standing next to. But a black hat, as shown in the third picture is typical for an internet troll (see the xkcd version of Black Hat), and also the guy saying LOL is already laughing out loud at you before you read his text. He also LOL's in his comment about the angsty teens that reads the books, and whom he looks forward to trolling.  In the second 4chan panel all four images relate to Twilight. The first picture most likely depicts Edward Cullen and Bella Swan (from the movies) standing with their backs against each other. This person enjoys being anonymous. The second picture with the text Dawnz refers, in ""plural"" form, to the last book Breaking Dawn which was split into two films part 1 and part 2. This person wish to know about peoples favorite vampire, exactly the kind of questions the trolls would have mocked on the Twilight board, now infesting their own site. The third picture is of a person (man/woman?) who have tried to dress up like a goth vampire, even commenting on the darkness of the picture. The last picture depicts the cover of the last book Breaking Dawn with the two chess pieces. This fan seems to be searching for a date around Dallas...  The title text refers to Walt Kelly's famous saying. Kelly used it to refer to all of mankind, whereas here it refers to the users of 4chan, by bringing on the enemy of their forum themselves.","[A list of post comments alongside pictures on a website. The first picture shows a page from a book/website with a small black picture with a white feature in the upper left corner and text to the right and below it.

The third picture shows a man with a black hat holding up a sword to the left and a trumpet to the right. The fourth and last picture is cut off in the middle at the bottom of the frame.

Across the top border of the frame is a smaller frame with a caption:] Hours Later:  Stephenie Meyer (typing): Hi, it's Stephenie Meyer. Fine, you don't like my books. But please leave us alone.

597: Addiction,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/597:_Addiction,internet,"But if you unplug everything, it gets so quiet you hear that high-pitched empty-room hum. And then the whispers begin.","Megan is attempting to stay a weekend at home without the Internet as she feels the constant exposure to novelty (from her internet surfing) saps her own initiative. She writes a ""last"" on-line message about her resolution to Cueball, but he writes back that he doubts she can do it for even one hour.   She turns off her computer (or at least the screen) and stands up triumphantly next to it, however then she logs right back on to write to Cueball that it's not half bad being off-line, thus violating her original attempt as she clearly used a computer to send the message to Cueball. She doesn't even realize she did this until Cueball replies with the written sound Ahem? proving he was right about less than one hour.   Very typical of people having some kind of addiction, in this case for being on-line, they may not even realize when they indulge into it, which is the case with Megan here.  The title text elaborates on Megan's addiction, saying that when she turns off all of the machines in the room, it results in an ""empty-room hum"". This is a high pitched buzzing noise, which it is suggested results from the brain increasing its sensitivity to noises. This is a fairly normal experience, but the ""whispers"" mentioned may be slightly more sinister, as this is frequently associated as a sign of schizophrenia. See also 1590: The Source.","[Close up of Cueball typing at his computer.

621: Superlative,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/621:_Superlative,internet,"Stay while I recount the crazy TF2 kill I managed yesterday, my friends.","The comic parodies a famous advertisement campaign for the Dos Equis beer brand. In the campaign, Jonathan Goldsmith plays ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"", a suave elderly gentleman with a number of astonishing life experiences and skills. The campaign's format generally includes the narrator presenting hyperbolic descriptions of the man's accomplishments, followed by the man delivering his signature catchphrase, ""I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis."", which has been widely adopted as an internet meme.  Cueball plays the antithesis of the protagonist in the campaign: the least interesting man in the world. Unlike the stories in the advertisement, his affairs tend to bore the listeners. Being the generic everyman, he possesses no outstanding capabilities at all. While the original is said to ""speak French... in Russian"", Cueball seems to have forgotten his French altogether. He also has apparently nothing of interest to tell, either in real life or in his blog. Instead, he will talk away about his weird dreams and his success in video games. Moreover, he is unable to stand too much beer and therefore absolutely ill-qualified to advertise it.  The title text is a reference to the slogan of the campaign ""Stay thirsty, my friends."" It also references Team Fortress 2 (TF2), a multi-platform, multi-player First-person shooter game.","He has dreams. [Cueball is gesturing to Megan.] Cueball: I was in this weird cross between work and my old house... Which he'll tell you all about. He can speak French. Or could in high school, anyway. A little.

624: Branding,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/624:_Branding,internet,"Actually, 'RSS&M' is kinda catchy.","This comic pokes fun at web sites (adult-themed sites in particular) which try to inflate their popularity by comparing themselves to other popular online services.  The strip shows four such advertisements that appear to Cueball as he browses the Internet.  Adblock is a browser extension which prevents advertisements from being displayed. Presumably Cueball normally browses the Internet with Adblock enabled, and thus would not see any of these ads.  The first advertises a website that brands itself as the ""Facebook of sex"". Because Facebook is ubiquitous, this is probably a good branding idea. Facebook is known to most users and connotes an easy-to-use platform where it's very easy to find people, chat with them, share pictures, etc. For someone looking for sex, this would probably seem like a good site to use. There are, in fact, sites that use this branding in their advertisements and/or their user interface which is likely what inspired Randall to write this comic. Cueball sighs and moves on, probably having seen this kind of ad many times already.  The second brands itself as ""Twitter for 18+ singles"". It is a similar but seemingly invented ad which again plays on the ubiquity and popularity of Twitter. Twitter being a (generally) public chat forum which limits posts to 140 characters is still popular enough to get some attention and make someone think about going to the site.  Sending messages to the world in 140 characters or less might be somewhat less of a versatile platform than Facebook for chatting with other singles, but still perhaps viable. Cueball notes that it is becoming more and more popular to brand adult sites by comparing them to popular non-adult sites.  This third takes a turn for the unusual, branding itself as ""Google Reader for S&M"". Google Reader is a now-defunct platform that allows users to aggregate web feeds such as RSS feeds into one place for convenience. The service is notably less well-known and popular than Facebook or Twitter, and given that it doesn't directly link you with other people, doesn't have the same connotation of allowing you to connect with others. Perhaps it would be a site that allowed you to aggregate various fan fictions, blogs, or other written works relating to S&M. However, Cueball is surprised such a site would exist.  The final ad brands itself as a ""GitHub for lesbians"". GitHub is a website that allows developers to collaborate on software projects using the Git revision control system. The concept is absurd — GitHub has a specialized function unrelated to anyone's gender or orientation, and it's barely a social network at all; the usefulness or appeal of such a system made specific to lesbians is not apparent. Cueball is surprised and possibly even intrigued by this last ad.  The title text relates to the third panel.  RSS is a technology involved in Google Reader. RSS&M is a portmanteau of RSS and S&M.  This is a possible way for the third web site to brand itself.","Browsing without adblock [Cueball is sitting at a computer.] [Pop-up window with red background.] The Facebook of SEX! Click now!

635: Locke and Demosthenes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/635:_Locke_and_Demosthenes,internet,Dear Peter Wiggin: This letter is to inform you that you have received enough up votes on your reddit comments to become president of the world. Please be at the UN tomorrow at 8:00 sharp.,"This comic re-imagines a scene from Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, this is shown in the first two panels depicting the siblings Locke and Demosthenes, as Cueball and the girl. Their real names are Peter and Valentine Wiggin (and these first names are used in the official transcript on xkcd). In the book these two kids write their opinions on their world's version of the internet to gain extreme political influence. Below is a synopsis:  Spoiler alert!  In the book Ender is an above-average-intelligence boy who is selected to become a potential leader of Earth's ""Defense"" Forces in the event of another Bugger invasion (later re-titled the Formic invasions). Meanwhile, Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine decide to save the world from itself. They do this by asserting themselves as wise demagogues who comment on political events on what are known as the ""free nets"" which are nets open to comment by anyone in the world. They choose pseudonyms to write under, as no one would take the words of children seriously, choosing Locke (Peter's pseudonym), and Demosthenes (Valentine's) and begin work. Eventually they gain enough respect to be invited to participate in moderated political debates in the higher class nets. By the end of the book, Peter has become the leader of the world, and Valentine runs away with Ender to a planet formerly inhabited by Buggers to live out their lives in peace. End spoiler alert!  Ender's Game was published in 1985, when most people had never used (and some had never heard of) the internet. The first webpage set up with individual personal opinions (leaving out forums and bulletin board services) was online in 1994, the word ""weblog"" was invented in 1997 and ""blog"" in 1999. When Orson Scott Card wrote Ender's Game, Peter and Valentine's plan was based on a sci-fi idea expected to occur in the near future.  However, this apparently science-fictional future concept is now just the mundane (and extremely un-influential) act of blogging. In 1985, Orson Scott Card's idea of how politics works in practice may have seemed a little naive, but now that blogging is an everyday phenomenon, Peter and Valentine's aspirations seem downright silly. We see their plan to win vast political influence manifest itself as a WordPress blog, and a particularly unimportant one at that, with 0 comments on most posts.  The joke hinges on the underwhelming reversal of Peter and Valentine's expectations. It forms both a parody of science fiction that has been rendered outdated by technology, and also a parody of the expectations well-intentioned people have going onto the internet to express their opinions.  The titles of Peter's blog posts parody the arrogance of internet commentators, with names beginning with things like ""Everyone's wrong about..."" This further underscores the lack of influence his WordPress blog would have and his naivete, as this is a typically unconvincing way to speak to people about politics, but someone with the arrogance to think everyone will naturally see their genius and insist they be put in charge of the world would not realise it.  In the bottom right corner there are links to other blogs. One is for Demosthenes, but the other is for FiveThirtyEight, a real political blog that was fou nded by Nate Silver in 2008, more than a year before this comic was released. It was still owned by Nate in 2009, the year of this comic's release, but in 2010 the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and in July 2013, ESPN announced that it would become the owner. The blog takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college: 538. It is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging. Nate Silver has been referenced, several times in xkcd, though mainly in the title text, before this comic for instance in 500: Election.  The title text uses Locke's full name, Peter Wiggin, and is formed as a short letter that informs him that he has become the president of the world, and that he should meet tomorrow 8:00 sharp at the united nations (UN) headquarters. This is a very child-like representation of how a presidential appointment might be announced, further riffing on the naivete of the plan in the first place.   Also note that the note is addressed to ""Peter"" rather than ""Locke""; Peter's attempt to remain anonymous has failed miserably. The title text says that Peter got the presidential post because he received enough up votes on his reddit comments!  During their conversation, Peter is shown feeding a squirrel. In Ender's Game the character of Peter Wiggin is a sadistic sociopath - and there is a particular scene in the book where Valentine stumbles across a skinned squirrel still twitching in pain.  References to both Ender's Game and Squirrels are frequently recurring tropes in xkcd.","[The ""real"" names and the fact that the squirrel is vomiting comes from the official transcript on xkcd.]  [Valentine (a.k.a.

This is taken to its logical extreme in this comic when that Facebook feature repeatedly, in an increasingly voyeuristic fashion, tries to get Cueball to hook up with his occasional friend-with-benefits Susie, despite the fact that Cueball knows she's falling for him and doesn't want to lead her on.  According to the title text, Cueball and Susie (who is drawn as a sexy version of Megan) do end up hooking up, even against Cueball's better judgement, as so often happens between people who're physically attracted to one another. And he apparently left the webcam on as well, because the Facebook feature is now giving suggestions on what Cueball should do to her, mid-coitus.","[Cueball is sitting at his computer.

713: GeoIP,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/713:_GeoIP,internet,"Meet hot young singles in your mom's basement today'? Man, screw you, GeoIP.","GeoIP is a service that converts IP addresses to their respective location on the Earth. This is done by looking up the IP address in a database maintained by various internet service providers. Advertisers often take advantage of the Joneses effect by creating localized ads which misleadingly appear to be specific to your location, but are often simply stock photographs with the name of the nearest town superimposed on top.  The comic satirizes this phenomenon. The International Space Station (ISS) has a high speed data downlink, but no direct connection to the internet. But here, Cueball trolls the advertisers from on board the ISS, by inserting his actual location on low Earth orbit into the database under that IP address. He proudly present his result to Ponytail where the advertisements claim that there are ""local girls"" in low Earth orbit; a distance of roughly 420 kilometers above the Earth surface, and thus at least that far away from all other girls in the world if they are not on the space station.   The title text shows GeoIP has become so accurate that it can now pinpoint the user's location to his Mom's basement. In United States, an adult living with his/her parents is termed shameful for that person, since it means that the adult does not have a job and cannot support himself. The ads are typically of the form -- ""Meet hot young singles in <user's location>"" where the <user's location> part is filled in from GeoIP. In this case, the GeoIP is so accurate that it not just identifies that user is in his parents' house, but it also pinpoints the location that he's hiding in the basement, perhaps because he does not want to be seen by people visiting his parents. Thus GeoIP is unknowingly shaming the user by reminding him that he is in his mom's basement, and hence the ""Screw you"" response.","[External view of a the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting the blue Earth below, shown with white clouds as stripes below and black sky above.

727: Trade Expert,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/727:_Trade_Expert,internet,"I mean, it's been almost twenty years. Now, it's possible you're simply embedding Windows directory paths in your URIs, but in that case you need more than just a short lecture.","Cueball as a news anchor has another Cueball-like character as guest in the studio, a doctor who is also a trade expert. However, Steven Berlee turns out to be a fraud. In reality he is a frustrated programmer willing to lie his way on to news show to share his message with any newscasters wiling to listen:  The slash character (/), also known as forward slash, is the correct way to separate distinct parts of a web address; for example in the address ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)"", a slash follows the ""org"" and the ""wiki"". However, some newscasters are unfamiliar with the distinction between the different types of slashes, thus confusing the normal slash with the backslash (\), the wrong character. They may also be somewhat overzealous by trying to specify forward- or backslash since just saying ""slash"" would be sufficient. Also as mentioned in the title text the backslash is used in addresses on a windows PC.  Steven Berlee claims that he suffers every time this mistake is made in a news program, explaining his reason for cheating his way on the air. Steven's name is most likely made up, as it seems to be taken from two or three of the inventors of the Internet:  Searching the internet lists no one called Steven Berlee, and the only references points back to this comic.  The title text refers to how in the Windows operating system, the backslash is actually used instead of the slash as a separator (in contrast to Unix-based systems, which use the forward slash). Thus, the path to any Windows file encoded in a URI (uniform resource identifier) would correctly contain the backslash character. However, placing such an URI into a web address to be shared on a news show would be completely useless, as they are only accessible inside of a local Windows domain (usually one's own computer) and no one would be able to access that file over the Internet.   In the title text Steven complains that after having had the modern version of the Internet for 20 years (since early 90s and this comic was released in 2010) they should have learned the difference by now. He also continues to claim that if they do not understand the difference between an internet url and Windows directory paths, and thus embedding these into their urls, then he cannot help them with just a short lecture while he con his way to time on the air.","[Cueball as a news anchor is sitting behind a desk with his hand on the desk, leaning towards his off-panel guest to the right.] Cueball: And for more on the summit, we turn to trade expert Dr. Steven Berlee.

741: Blogging,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/741:_Blogging,internet,I'm looking to virally monetize your eyeballs by selling them for transplants.,"This comic is a satire of the conflict between consumers who expect quality results and creators who just want to make easy money by pandering to their audience. Cueball says the key to making a successful blog is to build a relationship with your readers. While this may be a good way to ensure you are delivering content that is relevant to your audience, if a blogger keeps the audience's interests as the foremost priority, the blog may become focused on making their core audience happy rather than quality. When an audience member raises the concern that quality should be a paramount concern if you want to impress people, Cueball responds that content (the quality of the blog's content) will be addressed later in the speech. This quickly placates the audience member, illustrating how the audience (for example, readers) of a service can be easily satisfied by telling them what they want to hear. This validates Cueball's point that the audience does not want quality as much as they want to hear their own ideas repeated back to them.  Alternative explanation: This comic is a shot at all the typical blogging and social media instruction that is given. Cueball indicates he believes great content is not the highest priority when writing a blog, relegating it to at least part three of the coverage. The person in the audience, who is representing the ""normal people"", shows that people actually go to blogs for good content and couldn't care less about the other ""strategies"" the person on the stage is talking about. ""Awesome! I love content,"" is probably highly sarcastic, implying that Cueball's talk is rather devoid of it. It could imply that the speaker thinks this talk is mostly marketing jargon that misses the fundamental aspects of writing skills (style, personality, good ideas, research, basics of style) and focusing instead on schemes to artificially gain popularity.  The title text takes a jab at blogs concerned with ""viral content"" and ""monetization"". That is, bloggers are only concerned about their audience because they might potentially give them money. Cueball drops some marketing jargon — ""monetize the reader's eyeballs"" — in order to disguise his true purpose: illegal organ harvesting.","[Cueball stands on a stage before a large audience, holding a pointer and using it to highlight something on a screen behind him. He interacts with a member of the audience after making a point.] Cueball: The key to making a successful blog is building a relationship with your readers. Audience Member: I thought it was ""make your updates good so people will want to read them."" Cueball: We'll discuss content generation in part three. Audience Member: Awesome! I LOVE content."
773: University Website,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/773:_University_Website,internet,"People go to the website because they can't wait for the next alumni magazine, right? What do you mean, you want a campus map? One of our students made one as a CS class project back in '01! You can click to zoom and everything!","This comic uses a Venn diagram to point out that there is often a significant disparity between what a university displays on the front page of its website and what users — particularly prospective students — are primarily interested in finding there.  This is often because those who are making the university website instinctively believe, from their perspective, that the website should contain things that the university is proud of, or that they personally find useful, so they are unable to look at it from the perspective of a person who is new on campus and simply wants to know what number to call for campus security. Thus, simple details like contact information and university data are often overlooked.  The title text presents a satirical response from the school defending their site design, consisting mostly of PR worthy of an alumni magazine (a publication that is seldom anticipated so eagerly). It also uses sarcasm to make fun of university websites that have wildly out of date site design (web technology was relatively primitive in 2001) and a CS (Computer Science) student built it instead of a professional.","[A venn diagram.] [The left circle is labeled ""Things on the front page of a university website"" and contains:] ""campus photo slideshow"" ""alumni in the news"" ""promotions for campus events"" ""press releases"" ""statement of the school's philosophy"" ""letter from the president"" ""virtual tour""  [The right circle is labeled ""Things people go to the site looking for"" and contains:] ""list of faculty phone numbers and emails"" ""campus address"" ""application forms"" ""academic calendar"" ""campus police phone number"" ""department course lists"" ""parking information"" ""usable campus map""  [The only item in the overlapping section is:] ""full name of school"""
802: Online Communities 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/802:_Online_Communities_2,internet,"Best trivia I learned while working on this: 'Man, Farmville is so huge! Do you realize it's the second-biggest browser-based social-networking-centered farming game in the WORLD?' Then you wait for the listener to do a double-take.","This comic shows a map of internet communities where the size of each region roughly corresponds to its size, and its proximity to other regions indicates similarities. This is the successor of 256: Online Communities. It differs in that it is updated, and furthermore, instead of using the membership of whichever service to determine its size on the map, it uses its ""daily social activity."" The map actually has two super−maps intended to show the relative usage of types of communication: the online community map is surrounded by the much larger ""countries"" of E−Mail, SMS (""Instant Messaging"") and ""Cell Phones,"" which in turn are surrounded by the even huger ""Spoken Language."" It is unclear whether ""Cell Phones"" is intended to represent an independent region, or whether it is meant to be a sub-region of ""Spoken Language."" The ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that cell phones are the primary medium of SMS, and are also used to access email and online communities. It's also unclear why other forms of communication, such as handwritten letters, are not included. At the title text Randall explains that, using his definition of ""most activity per day,"" Farmville is actually the second most popular social-network farming game - the Chinese game Happy Farm was more popular at the time. This strikes many English-speaking xkcd readers as odd, because Farmville is much more famous, leading one to wonder how it could not be the most played. The phrase ""browser-based social-networking-centered farming game"" is an example of an overly-narrow superlative. [edit]Facebook Region The Facebook region deals with social networks, that is, websites oriented towards having people meet. Facebook is a social networking site that allows people to meet old real−life friends and make new friends that share similar interests. One of its most notable features is that a member can update a ""status"" or make normal posts about the happenings of the member's life, complete with pictures, other members ""liking"" these posts. The size of the Facebook region is not exaggerated; most websites seem to allow ""liking"" their content or allow/require logging in the website with a Facebook account. There even are cell phones with a ""Facebook"" button! FarmVille and Farm Town are Facebook games in which users manage farms. Happy Farm, the Chinese game that inspired the other two, does not require Facebook integration, so it is separated by a solid line from Facebook. The ""Unethical Bay"" refers to how these games tend to addict players into constantly buying virtual items of questionable value. People You Can't Unfriend refers to people whom, due to real-life expectations and relationships, unfriending them is difficult, no matter how you really feel about them. Blatherskite River refers to the conversations on Facebook, which may be long yet devoid of general meaning or logic. Data Mines refer to the data mining that Facebook does with the interests of its members. This fuels the profitable advertising business at the expense of customer trust. Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions refer to how interactions with family members on Facebook suddenly become more awkward because everyone on Facebook (and sometimes off Facebook, given that you do not necessarily need to log in if you want to see someone's Facebook account) if you are discussing with your family through post comments. 524,287 Strong for Mersenne Primes refers to the communities who gain followers for a cause. A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is 1 less than a power of 2; 524287 is the 7th known Mersenne prime. Jungle-Bay Mountains of ""It's Complicated"" refers to one of Facebook's options as to what a user's relationship status currently is. A Jungle-Bay Mountain is a complicated and undefined climate, hence the complication. ""lamebook bay"" refers to the online website ""lamebook"", where users post photos of funny things that happen on Facebook (these can include statuses, ""fails"", put-downs and images.) ""Old Facebook"" Resistance refers to Facebook's earlier users, who have often resisted (and resented) changes made to Facebook as it became more popular. Privacy Controls is located on the map surrounded by a Lava Pool, which is a reference to how difficult it is to find the privacy controls within Facebook. Niche Market Mountains refers to social networks aimed towards more niche markets are located. Similar to how mountains tend to be isolated from mainland, niche social networks tend to be just that: niche, without much interaction with the general populace. Charred Wasteland of Abandoned Social Networks refers to the tons of websites wanting to take advantage of the success of websites like Facebook to compete or even overpower with them. Even so, these websites tend to not have the userbase or even the expertise towards the long-term, hence they become wastelands: environments devoid of life, except the few life forms that are from these wastelands (in this case, the ones who are loyal to the website or which are sadly few). In the Charred Wasteland stands Ozymandias, the titular broken statue of Shelley's poem. In the poem, only ""two vast and trunkless legs of stone"" and a ""shattered visage"" are all that remain of the once-great statue and both of these features are present in the comic. According to the poem, the pedestal before the broken statue reads ""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings..."" hence ""friend of friends"" below Ozymandias on the map. In the north are the Duckface Mountains and the Red Cup Mountains.""Duckface"" refers to this incredibly obnoxious facial expression, and ""red cup pictures"" are any pictures containing party-goers holding disposable red plastic beverage cups. Facebook is absolutely flooded with both types of pictures. In the south is Buzzword Bay. Buzzwords are words and phrases that make you sound a lot more topical than you actually are, used to garner attention; again, Facebook status updates are commonly filled with buzzwords. While Facebook is the largest ""country"" of the Facebook Region, there are a lot of smaller ""countries"" that represent smaller social networks. Below Facebook (and ""Old Facebook' Resistance"") is Diaspora, a fully open-source, decentralized, privacy-respecting-and-expecting alternative to Facebook. From what this map tells, Diaspora is little-known, even if Facebook is taken out of the context. StudiVZ is a German-speaking social network similar if not a ripped-off version of Facebook. XING is a German-speaking social platform similar to LinkedIn. Ning is a service to create custom social websites. Its free services shut down in 2010. Taringa! is a Spanish-speaking social network that is based on a forums. Copyrighted material is frequently found there. Next to the Euro(pean) Gulf is Skyrock (social network site), a French-speaking social network. Wer-kennt-wen is a German-social network somewhat like MySpace. Nasza-klasa.pl or NK, is a Polish-speaking social network based on school relationships. Badoo is a social network primarily based on dating and picture-sharing. Classmates.com is a service in which the user can meet classmates that came from the same high school. The website is probably best known by its memetic advertisement that said ""She married him??!! And they've got 7 kids??"" (Incidentally, there is more to the coupled picture than what the advertisement says.) Myspace is a social networking website that is a kind of proto-Facebook: users could customize their one-page websites with whatever they wanted, make their interests and daily lives public, and interact with other users. Back in the mid 2000s, MySpace was the largest social network, many people using the website; however, the surprisingly-less-customizable Facebook ended up taking the place of MySpace. The ""bands"" country of MySpace refers to how a lot of bands in the day advertised and interacted using the website. Indeed, the latest incarnation of MySpace (in terms of 2013) is more oriented towards band members. LinkedIn is a social network aimed towards people in the workplace, which is why it is adjacent to Corporate Bay. Orkut was one of Google's first social networks before Google made Google+. It shut down in 2014. Hi5 is a social network that is very popular among people in Latin America. Renren (「人人」, ""people"" in Chinese) is ""a Chinese copy of Facebook."" Bebo was a social network popular in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It went bankrupt in 2013 and will move away from social networking and into apps. Friendster - One of the first major social networks, it has fallen way off in usage in recent years and was eclipsed by MySpace. It is still popular in Asia. Vkontakte or VK, is the second largest social network service in Europe after Facebook. It is available in several languages, but particularly popular among Russian-speaking users around the world. Netlog is a Belgian social networking website specifically targeted at the global youth demographic. Mixi is an online Japanese social networking service. Qzone is a social networking website, which is big in China. According to a report published by Tencent, possibly surpassing other social networking websites like Facebook and MySpace in China. Tuenti is a Spain-based, social networking service, that has been referred to as the ""Spanish Facebook."" Cloob is a Persian-language social networking website, mainly popular in Iran. After the locally (and internationally) popular social networking website Orkut was blocked by the Iranian government, a series of local sites and networks, including Cloob, emerged to fill the gap. Kaixin001 is a social networking website which ranks as the 13th most popular website in China and 67th overall. Piczo was a privately held blog website for teens. In November 2012, Piczo.com shut down. Odnoklassniki is a social network service for classmates and old friends. It is popular in Russia and former Soviet Republics. Adult FriendFinder is a pornographic dating site. Match.com is a dating site, mainly targeted at people looking for marriage. Ok Cupid is another dating site, however it has been owned by Match.com since 2011. PlentyofFish is yet another dating site, also owned by Match.com since June 2015. Sulawesi is a real-life island in the Indonesian archipelago. It also appears in 256: Online Communities. [edit]MMO Isle MMOs (short form of ""Massive Multiplayer Online Game"") are online games where multiple people take the role of a character and play in a setting hosted by the game. Habbo Hotel is a website where someone creates a human avatar an interacts in a virtual world that is not that different from the one in real life. Club Penguin is Disney's MMO where someone creates a penguin avatar and interacts with other in a more polar, cartoony setting. Club Penguin is aimed towards children. Maple Story is an MMO that has a more natural setting. The most distinguishing feature of Maple Story is its cartoony pixel art. GameFAQs, while not an MMO, is a website that has the largest repository of walkthoughs, that is, guides that help someone beat a game. GameFAQs is notable for not only its large repository of walkthroughs of games that are across an extreme variety of consoles, handhelds, and even computers (not all of them MMOs), but also the drama that is rumoured to happen in the GameFAQs forums. IGN (full: Imagine Games Network), while also not an MMO, is the largest website that gives news on video games in general, not just MMOs. Each of the games mentioned in the site have pages that have summaries, reviews, screenshots, other art, videos, and links to news related to its games. FFXI (full: Final Fantasy XI) is an MMO from SquareEnix, being the first MMO of the popular Final Fantasy series. Runescape is an older MMO. Starcraft II is a realtime strategy game with a science fiction setting that heavily involves space travel. While technically not an MMO, it has a significant online multiplayer component. WoW (full: World of Warcraft) is the definitive MMO, being not only the most popular and one of the longest-running but also the most expansive (having its own spinoff games, comic books, novels, and even figurines), WOW giving the idea of how an MMO should be. A player can choose from a variety of races, each with its own heavy history. Second Life is similar to Habbo, albeit with a bigger suspension of disbelief (one example being that the player does not need to be a human) and in a 3D setting. NationStates is a text-based political simulation game. Notably, some of its traffic comes not from the actual game (which is optional), but the extensive set of political, roleplaying, and general forums attached. Urban Dead describes itself as ""A Massively Multi-Player Web-Based Zombie Apocalypse"", which sums it up pretty well. KoL (full: Kingdom of Loathing) is a comedic browser-based MMO-ish RPG with minimalistic stick-figure art. CDC Games is a Chinese company reputed to be the largest MMORPG distributor. EVE Online is a science fiction MMO which is notable because of its virtual economy. Gaia or Gaia Online, while not an MMO, is a forum oriented towards pop culture, including video games and Japanese media. Its most notable feature is the heavy customization possible of a member's pixel-art avatar. Its members tend to roleplay a lot, albeit in a more written, story-based form. Gaia has gained a reputation with its members stealing art and causing drama. The ferry that links the gaia island with 4chan was most likely due to the ""boxxy"" row, where vlogger boxxy posted videos of her using gaia, which then were circulated on 4chan. This resulted in a division of the sites users, and many more hacking attacks, including a DDOS attack on 4chan itself. EverQuest (full: EverQuest) is one of the first MMO's, it's still running and has a huge number of expansions. UO (full: Ultima Online) along with EverQuest this was one of the first and longest running MMO's. CoH or City of Heroes was a superhero-based MMORPG that was shut down November 2012. Atlantica (full: Atlantica Online) is a turn-based MMORPG. Lineage is a Korean MMORPG, it's North American servers were closed 2011/06/29 due to being unprofitable. Lineage II is a Korean MMORPG, mainly played in Asia along with its predecessor. It adopted a Free to Play model on 2011/11/30. SubSpace was a 2D, topdown shooter released in 1997. The servers have been shut down, but it continues to operate through the work of fans. It's widely considered an early entry into the MMO genre due to its unprecedentedly high player count. Other notable regions include: The Mountains of Steam, referring to the game distribution service Steam where people can buy and download video games in general, not just MMOs. There is also an extensive community where users can share content, and instant messaging chat by text, voice, or game streaming. River Grind refers to ""grinding."" In most MMOs, the character is a fighter of some sorts, yet starts at a level 1, signifying the character's aptitude level in combat. The character can level up and gain more aptitude levels through earning experience, of which the most reliable and otherwise common way is the process of ""grinding,"" that is, repeatedly fighting opposing monsters (sometimes of a level notably lower that your character's), gaining experience points from winning these battles until your character gains a level, that is, ""levels up"". While a practical necessity in strengthening the character, this process can be tiresome, hence the expression ""grinding."" Spawn Camp refers to ""spawn points"", the places where AI-powered enemies and players who have died in-game respawn, and the act of ""spawn camping"", in which the player character simply stands behind or around the spawn points to fight the enemy creatures or respawning players as soon as they appear. Gulf of Lag refers to how the MMO can be slowed down a considerable amount due to the large amount of players simultaneously using the same server, this congestion bogging down the server and frustrating the users. End Guy for the Internet refers to ""end bosses,"" the last — and usually hardest to defeat — ""bad guy"" in a game (or a section of a game). [edit]YouTube Region The YouTube region refers to websites that are based on user-created content. YouTube is the definitive video website where people can upload videos with the purpose of public viewing, ranging from home movies through official music videos through Let's Plays of people playing video games to questionably-legal uploads of cartoons and films. Google had purchased YouTube. Many of the sites on the map are just references to viral videos at YouTube: Viral Shores refers to how viral videos (whether they be viral marketing or simply memes) tend to proliferate on YouTube. Britney likely refers to pop singer Britney Spears and the ""Leave Britney Alone"" guy. Maru Gulf refers to Maru the Cat, a YouTube celebrity also mentioned in xkcd. Prairie Dog Habitat likely refers to the viral video Dramatic Chipmunk (which is actually a Prairie Dog). Rick Rolling Hills references, well, Rickrolling. More information here. The ""deserted"" note likely refers to how Rick Astley himself is tired of the meme, or again, how people tend to leave the video upon getting ""Rick Roll'd,"" never actually going to the video with the express purpose of viewing the video. Lunar Landing Soundstage is, of course, a reference to the Moon landing conspiracy theories, which Randall has railed on before. OK Go Bay refers to the band ""OK Go"" who have multiple viral music videos on YouTube, most famously ""Here it goes again"" featuring treadmills. The HTML5 swamp refers to YouTube's spotty support of HTML 5 (an update on HTML that is frequently touting its media capabilities, making HTML 5 a viable alternative to Flash). Of course, by the time the comic was written, HTML 5 was still in its infancy. The Music Video Bay refers to the amount of music videos (official or otherwise) are present in YouTube. Other counties of the YouTube region include: vimeo, a website where people tend to showcase artistic content that they made on their own, notably independent studios. Snob Sound: Flickr, a website where people can upload and share photographs they took. Fotolog, a photo website very popular in South America in 2004-2008, which was used as a social network. Last.fm, a music website that is notable of its ""scrobbling"" feature. deviantArt, the largest art website, where people can upload, sell, and buy not only art itself, but also video, audio, Flash-work, and even skins (the original purpose of deviantArt). While many big-name/professional people and organizations have their works in deviantArt, the site is more infamous for the large amount of people who upload low-quality fan-art and fan-characters, most notably of media from Japan. Another point of infamy is the large amount of drama that can happen in the website. Newgrounds, a website that hosts art, (Flash-based) videos, audio, and (Flash-based) games to which other users can comment and rate. Even so, content from Newgrounds tends to be obscene, though there is a filtering system if a viewer does not wish to see obscene content. Chatroulette is a website where people are randomly paired up with each other and video/text chat. Brickshelf is the online resource for LEGO fans. Tumblr, where people could make a blog and post text, pictures, video, audio, quotes, and links. The most distinguishing feature is the ability to ""reblog"" these posts from other's people's blogs into the user's own blog. Notable features of Tumblr include sketchblogs (where people upload their sketches), Ask blogs (where people answer questions other users ask, the moderators of these blogs usually pretending to be a character from a form of media), and the large amount of ""social justice"" (a highly controversial political movement). (See also 1043: Ablogalypse.) b3ta is a popular British website, described as a ""puerile digital arts community"" by The Guardian. The Isle of teenagers who just discovered macroeconomics is a joke about how teenagers tend to think that the world and the economy are a lot simpler than they actually are. Combined with the typical internet mindset, this leads to a lot of teenagers posting blogs and videos and comments on blogs and videos describing how idiotic the government and other red-tape-related adults are. The Snob Sound could refer to the large amount of people who look down on others in the surrounding websites (one example being an original artist looking down on people who draw mainly fan-art). The Iraq is a reference to Miss Teen USA 2007, in which Ms. Teen South Carolina, Lauren Katlin, said ""I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like such as...the US should help the US and should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we are able to build up our future."" The usage of ""the Iraq"" has became a meme. [edit]Twitter Region Bieber Bay is a reference to Justin Bieber, a pop singer whose singing sprouted on YouTube and became very popular on Twitter and other social media. He is very much vilified because of his rather feminine appearance and his hordes of fans (called ""Beliebers"") that seem to support him to ridiculous extents. Lately, though, Justin Beiber has taken a ""bad boy"" attitude because of all the Beliebers who are willing to defend him no matter what, him partaking in a lot of questionable activities that include tattoos, questionably-legal substances, and buying prostitution, thus lowering his popularity in the general populace. Google Buzz is a former social network attempted by Google. It has since been shut down. Bit.Ly Mountains is a reference to the URL shortening service bit.ly. Kanye's Isle of Sadness is a reference to the musician Kanye West, whose Twitter, at the time, was famously introspective and stream-of-consciousness. Sarah Palin USA is the Twitter handle of former politician Sarah Palin. Clueless Politician Coast is a reference to the number of politicians on Twitter and other social networks who repeatedly share clueless updates that more often create an uproar than help their election chances. Desert of Food Updates is a reference to the number of pictures of food that are shared on social media (especially Twitter). There has even been some controversy on posting such pictures. Journalists Trying to Find the Cutting Edge is referencing journalists on Twitter trying to keep up with the way that news is gathered and delivered now, despite usually working for a newspaper that publishes once a day. SHAQ is a reference to the former NBA basketball player, Shaq. identi.ca is an open source social networking and micro-blogging service, being an alternative to Twitter. Breaking! Waves is a pun on the fact that so many people used the word ""Breaking"" at the beginning of tweets that do not warrant that tag that the word has lost most of its meaning and become a joke. It is a pun because waves ""break"" on the shore. Web 3.0 refers to the unofficial term Web 2.0. In this case, ""Web 1.0"" refers to websites that give information to users. Web 2.0 refers to websites where the users themselves create content. Web 3.0 has sometimes been used as a term for semantic web, a machine-readable version of the web, but this usage is far from universal. Hashtag games whose popularity confuses and depresses you refers to the game where a user posts something under a particular hashtag and others respond with their own ideas, all tagged under the same phrase. This has been very popular for no clear reason, as Randall notes. [edit]Geotagged Bay Yelp is a website where people post reviews of real-life public locations (one example being restaurants). Geocaching is a worldwide GPS scavenger hunt where users upload positions of caches and others will find them and log it online. Foursquare is a location-based social network. Latitude refers to Google Latitude. [edit]Troll Bay and the Sea of Memes Reddit is the self-described ""front page of the Internet"" in which users submit stories, photos and videos and the best are ""up-voted"" to the top of the page. Wikipedia Talk Pages refer to the pages where Wikipedia editors discuss how to improve articles. Wikia is a website offering free-of-charge wiki hosting, using a variant of Wikimedia's MediaWiki, allowing users to create user-editable encyclopedias of just about any subject matter, although it has more recently introduced an entertainment blog named ""Fandom powered by Wikia"" and eventually adopted that branding for the wiki farm as well. StumbleUpon is a website-sharing service. Delicious is a bookmarking and bookmark-sharing service. Digg is a former competitor to Reddit in the social-news sphere, but now has been sold and restarted as an aggregator of news stories. Slashdot, labeled ""/."" on the map, is a technical news site. Fark is a community website that allows members to comment on news articles from other sites. YTMND is an acronym for ""You're The Man Now, Dog!"" It's also a community in which users can create meme-type nonsense by playing music over an image (either static or animated). [edit]Skype Region The Skype Region refers to different IM, or Instant Messaging services, that enable almost-real-time text chatting between multiple people. These often allow services like voice chat and even video calls. Skype is, according to Randall, the most popular of these among the internet. It has many features to allow peer-to-peer voice chats, as well as allowing calls to be made at a price to actual phones. AIM or AOL Instant Messenger is a chat client created by AOL. GG or Gadu-Gadu is an instant messenger client popular in Poland. Yahoo Messenger is an instant messenger client by Yahoo. Google Talk is a voice/video chatting service from Google (that Google has been replacing with Hangouts). Google Talk also has an invasion fleet at its shores. ICQ is an older messaging service, albeit with an 18+ requirement (despite pornography not being the point of ICQ). Windows Live Messenger, or ""MSN"", was the messaging service of Microsoft before Microsoft bought Skype. MSN was useful in that people could draw and send pictures to other chatters. UseNet was one of the original ways to communicate on the internet, though people can download (copyrighted) files through the service. Since it is still in use by some, it gets the tag ""Still Around!"" on the map. IRC Isles refers to the ancestor of Internet-powered chatting. People would have connected to a server and spoke publicly. IRC is still in use (as of 2014), notably in getting help from other users. One of those isles is #xkcd which is an IRC community around xkcd. [edit]Bay of Drama FanFiction.net is a website where people can submit their fanfiction (stories by fans written about other peoples' media, normally that about popular media). The website tends to have people that are not helpful to those who legitimately want critique of their own stories. Xanga is a blogging service that, while popular at its time, lost out to... LiveJournal was the most popular blogging service before Tumblr. ONYD - Reference to Oh No You Didn't, which is explained in the Blogosphere region. Dreamwidth is a LiveJournal fork emphasizing its open-source nature. [edit]Blogosphere The Blogosphere region contains several general blog topics. Photo Blogs are commonly used to chronicle the lives of the authors through photographs. Diary Blogs are another popular use of blogs (and, in fact, the original use) where authors write commentary about their lives. Bay of Grammar Pedantry deals with the fact that, whether due to a lack of proper education, a habit of using ""chat-speak"" in the text-limited SMS and MMS, or simply due to the (generally) more relaxed nature of the Internet, blog authors tend to write with horrible composition, a point of annoyment to a lot of other people due to the subsequent increased difficulty of reading the horribly-written material. Fandom Blogs are blogs created by a ""fandom"" which is a community of fans. A fandom blog deals with the subject matter of the respective fandom. Sea of Zero (0) Comments refers to blogs that get very little attention and therefore have no comments. SpamBlog Straits references spammers who use blogs to increase the number of links to their site to try to game search engines. OffTopic.com is a general interest forum that refers to itself as ""the largest general discussion forum on the internet."" Many more straightforward blogs, including: Writing/Poetry Gossip Blogs Political Blogs Music Blogs Tech Blogs Business Blogs Corporate Blogs Religious Blogs Miscellaneous Blogs Blog Blogs - These can refer to blogs that talk about the matter about blogging itself, though they can also refer to blogs which authors use in talking about blogging.

There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.  A peninsula on the south-west, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the south-east of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the south-west part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.  The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.  In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmville and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks.

Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leaf reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).

834: Wikileaks,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/834:_Wikileaks,internet,STUDENTS ARE CALLING PRESIDENT JOHNSON EN MASSE TO PROTEST THE BOMBING AND IT'S JAMMED THE WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD. COULD THEY COLLAPSE OUR CRITICAL PHONE SYSTEMS? HAS THE FIRST TELEPHONE WAR BEGUN? STAY TUNED FOR MORE ON THIS DANGEROUS NEW TECHNOLOGY.,"This comic references WikiLeaks, a site to which classified data can be sent for publication, while nobody would know who leaked the data.  Many people dislike WikiLeaks, but proponents claim that, since government is supposed to work for the people, all government information should be available to anyone who wants to see it. WikiLeaks' actions are illegal in most countries, and the people maintaining WikiLeaks stay anonymous, with the notable exception of Julian Assange, the spokesperson. Among the supporters of Wikileaks are the 4chan-based activism/hacker group Anonymous, who, for the week or so prior to this comic's release, used DDoS attacks to take down servers for companies that aided the governments of the world in taking down Wikileaks and its CEO, Julian Assange. Amazon, PayPal and MasterCard were all targets of Anonymous. The claim 'We are legion' is a reference to Mark chapter 5 in the Bible, in which Jesus throws out a group of demons that call themselves Legion, ""for we are many.""  The comic imagines an ironic scenario in which WikiLeaks, the organization Anonymous fought to protect, stays true to their mission of releasing secrets to the public, and publishes the personal information of Anonymous members. The joke in the comic notes a contradiction in Anonymous's position, relying on strict secrecy of its members' private information while supporting an anti-secrecy organization like WikiLeaks. This may be a reference to an incident in 2009 when WikiLeaks published a leaked list of some of their anonymous donors, following their then-policy of complete impartiality regarding leaks.  In theory, Anonymous consists of everyone who takes steps to remain anonymous, not merely the hackers and criminals. In practice, Julian would merely have to post a list of Wikileaks contributors.  The title text appears to be a news wire from during the Vietnam War when Lyndon B. Johnson was President in the United States. The students were calling to protest the War, in what xkcd implicates as the first DDoS attack. A DDoS attack is a Distributed Denial of Service attack, one of Anonymous' favorite tactics, in which the attackers send vast quantities of traffic from many different points to take down a web server, or, in the case of the title text, a phone network. Taken as a whole, the title text satirizes news reports in which a DDoS attack is confused with an actual hack, as only in the latter does the attacker gain (partial) access to the system itself.","[A black formal suit with no head is talking.] Suit: We are Anonymous. We are legion. We are no one and everyone. And we are here to fight for WikiLeaks.

837: Coupon Code,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/837:_Coupon_Code,internet,This also guarantees he won't be one of the ones to get a bobcat.,"Some online stores allow you to enter a coupon code for a discount on one of their products. Coupon codes may be a single, simple word or a complex sequence of characters. In this comic, Cueball enters a long and detailed blackmail message in the normally short coupon code form, hoping that blackmail could serve the way a coupon code would.  This works so well that Cueball is discounted the full price of the product he's buying. The humor comes from the fact that Cueball's intimidation works as if the online seller was an actual person, and not a computer.    The title text references 325: A-Minus-Minus; it has become a running gag that bobcats are occasionally sent by mail by Black Hat in various comics.","[The panel shows an online shopping form.] Shipping: $14.08 Total: $80.02 If you have a coupon code, enter it here: [An empty form.] Check out  Cueball is looking at his computer.

855: 1999,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/855:_1999,internet,"Whoa, twenty-two in two hours!' 'Your site got twenty-two hundred hits in two hours?' 'No. Twenty-two. But still, that's like half the people on the internet!'","This comic is a parody of the movie The Social Network, a movie about the founding of the popular social network site Facebook. Here, scenes from the movie are reimagined to feature Zombo.com instead. Zombo.com, also known as Zombocom, is a website that was created in 1999 and using only Flash animations. Randall, like many others more, doesn't like this technique at all. The animation consists of a circle of quickly pulsating dots and a friendly deep male voice repeatedly welcoming the visitor to ""Zombocom"" and explaining that there was no limit to what could be done at the site, or rather, no limit except yourself. The message repeats while, ironically, there is absolutely nothing that can be done at the site until the message completes, at which point a link saying ""Sign up for our newZletter"" appears, linking to a page saying that the selected option is not available yet. If the link is not clicked, the Flash player will reset. Thus, you can still do nothing on the site.  The humor of the parody comes in substituting Facebook, a useful and popular website, for Zombo.com, a novelty site which gained attention for its complete uselessness.  Turn on your speakers and check zombo.com for yourself.  The last four panels are all direct parodies of specific scenes from The Social Network. The second panel is a takeoff of the scene where Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg comes up with the idea for the site, saying that people like checking up on their friends and acquaintances, so why not build a site that lets them do that? Because Zombo.com has no actual function, in this version the founder can't specify what he wants the site to do.  The third panel is taken from a scene where Zuckerberg is seen intensely focused on his work programming the site, his headphones insulating him from the outside world. His assistant describes his state as ""wired in"" and demands that he not be disturbed. In the comic, as Zombo.com is a very simple site which does not need much coding, the assistant offers the possibility that the founder is stoned as a reason for his focus. Indeed, it's one of the few conceivable reasons that one would be this focused on such a boring and pointless website.  The fourth panel is taken from a scene where co-founder Eduardo Saverin tries to push for monetization of Facebook, while investor and consultant Sean Parker argues against. The actual dialogue is ""You don't even know what the thing is yet. How big it can get, how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool? A billion dollars."" Here, instead of a billion dollars, the Parker character argues ""Circles,"" playing off Zombo.com's un-lucrative nature and the silliness of the design.   The final panel is taken from a scene where Parker advises Zuckerberg to change the name of the site from TheFacebook to just Facebook, calling it ""cleaner."" Here, he advises to change the name of Zombo.com to just Zombocom. Why the website is pronounced ""Zombocom"" rather than the more expected Zombo Dot Com is a mystery known only to its creators; perhaps, like in the movie, they also considered it cleaner.  The title text is a reference to a quote from the movie, specifically a conversation between Zuckerberg and Delpy (Zuckerberg is the first quote). In the actual film, Zuckerberg answers ""twenty-two thousand"" rather than just ""twenty-two"". This is a joke to the effect that, back in 1999, there weren't really that many people on the internet, and very few of them would have gone to Zombo.com","It's easy to forget, as we heap awards on The Social Network, That before there was Facebook, MySpace, or even Friendster... One website dreamed bigger than them all.  [Cueball and another are talking.] Cueball: People like doing stuff. So why not build a website that offers that? Another: Offers what? What would I do there? Cueball: Anything! The only limit is yourself!  [Another scene. Hacker, wearing headphones and oblivious, working at computer.

862: Let Go,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/862:_Let_Go,internet,"After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected.","It is human nature to lose interest in difficult or boring tasks, and instead do something easier, more interesting or more rewarding in the short term. While procrastination and distraction from more important tasks has always been present, this comic casts a light on the internet and the huge potential for distraction which it provides.   The first two frames in this comic are the set-up, and contain the websites CNN and Reddit and thoughts over the top of them. These types of websites are regularly updated with new content are prime candidates for distraction. The thought bubbles indicate that the reader is fully aware that they shouldn't be looking at these websites, but is unable to stop himself. Even the very rational thought that checking news stories more than once a day is bordering on pointless doesn't seem to stop him.  In the third frame, it starts to look a little different as the screen is not a computer but is in fact the targeting computer from Luke Skywalker's X-wing. At this point it becomes clear that there are far more important tasks at hand, namely flying the craft. Even then, Luke has an internal conflict and considers checking Facebook, but mentally checks himself, and to prevent himself from further compulsive browsing shuts down the system. The thought bubble at the bottom is one that is probably familiar to many people (especially students), where he realizes that he has to turn off the computer to actually concentrate on the important task.  In the fourth frame, we finally get the movie reference from Star Wars as Princess Leia and one of the Rebel Alliance's officers are gathered around the holographic table that allows them to follow the battle. In the movie, Luke turns off his targeting computer because he uses the force to fire the torpedoes at the right time. But in this comic, Luke turns off the computer because he keeps getting distracted by Reddit and CNN. When they ask whether he is alright, he responds in the way most people would who have nearly been caught wasting time on the internet. This is however a quote of what he actually replies in the movie.   See the Destruction of Death Star scene on YouTube. The Let Go remark from Obi-Wan Kenobi that had given the title to this comic occurs about two minutes into the clip. Though here it is a reference to let go of refreshing websites...  The headlines on CNN read 'Bees?', 'Where is Oman?', and 'iReport (we mean you, that is.)'.  The headline Bees? could be a reference to Cards Against Humanity. One of the white cards says exactly that. It could also just be a question to the picture above - if it was bees following the guy.  The headline Where is Oman? is below a map where land is white. It shows Cyprus, Northern Egypt and the Middle East with the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (seas are grey). Oman is not on this map as it is not situated on the Persian Gulf; it's on the Gulf of Oman and on the Arabian Sea, both of which can be considered parts of the Indian Ocean.  The title text is a serious solution to a procrastination problem that we see in the comic, later explained to take the form of simply rebooting the computer.",[Reddit page.] Luke (thinking): I shouldn't be looking at Reddit. Why can't I stop?  [CNN page.] Luke (thinking): Refreshing CNN again. Do news stories so affect my life that I benefit from checking them more than once a day?  [Shutdown screen.] Luke (thinking): I should at least check Faceb... no. Screw it. I can't do my job when I'm distracting myself every five minutes like this.  [Two people before a battlefield screen.] Cueball: His computer's off. Luke - You've switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Luke: Nothing. I'm all right.

Sharing the top with the internet libertarians are Nate Silver and several politically-active kite designers.,"The Nolan Chart is a visual representation of the political spectrum that measures not only liberal vs conservative tendencies but also libertarian and statist tendencies. In this comic, it is taken to a different end. One one side are both Democrats and Republicans and on the other side are baseball fans. In the typical Nolan Chart, Libertarians are in the top quadrant, but in this one ""Internet Libertarians"" take the spot because they love the Nolan Charts (which are found online) and have a lot of political opinions.  Nolan may also refer to baseball hall of famer Nolan Ryan.  In the title text, the NFPA-compliant chemical manufacturers are mentioned because of this diagram. Sir Charles Wheatstone was the inventor of the Wheatstone bridge, which is also diamond-shaped. The image text makes reference to Nate Silver, who previously worked for Baseball Prospectus and now writes a data-driven political and sports blog called Five Thirty Eight for ESPN. He is both a lover of diamond-shaped diagrams and has political opinions. Politically-active kite designers both would have strong political opinions (it comes with the territory of being politically active) and would love diamond-shaped diagrams, presumably because they would be interested in blueprints of kites.","[Diamond-shaped four-panel diagram with each panel labeled.

The title, ""Extended Mind"", refers to a theory proposed by philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers, which postulates that the mind not only includes what can be found in the skull, but also incorporates external things, like Wikipedia.  The title text refers to an observed phenomenon that many of Wikipedia's page links eventually lead to the Philosophy page. This may be due to the fact that the first few links in any article tend to reference more general or abstract ideas, which eventually gravitate towards philosophy. This is not actually true, though. It works for the spark plug page and countless others but not for all. The comment section below has some examples, but many of them are not working anymore, because Wikipedia references change in time.","[An IM window is open over a Chrome window with tabs for Spark Plug, Feeler Gauge, and Wikipedia.] Message with Mike1979 Mike1979: I replaced my spark plugs and now my car is running weird.

940: Oversight,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/940:_Oversight,internet,I felt so clever when I found a way to game the Fitocracy system by incorporating a set of easy but high-scoring activities into my regular schedule. Took me a bit to realize I'd been tricked into setting up a daily exercise routine.,"Fitocracy is a web site that turns workouts into a social game by awarding points, badges, levels and all sorts of other gamification. Megan and Cueball, by their judgment, have spent approximately two hours engaged in sexual activity. However, according to this cartoon, Fitocracy does not consider sex to be an activity acceptable for its site, despite the vigorous nature of Cueball and Megan's sexual workout.  The title text explains how sites like Fitocracy are so successful. Because human brains, especially the cynical ones, like to game the system whenever they can, they will find easy things to do that also score high. In the case of Fitocracy, these are simple exercises that add up a lot when applied daily. But the creators of Fitocracy (and other such successful sites, like Weight Watchers or Lumosity) know this, and, as ""in Soviet Russia"", the system games you, as shown, to adopt an exercise regimen, or to lose weight, or to get smarter, or whatever else there is.  Sex does raise your breathing rate and heartbeat, but as sparkpeople (a similar site to fitocracy) notes, it is not as effective as a session at a gym, as it does not typically use the main muscle groups in their full range of motion and doesn't sustain a raised heartbeat for a sufficient length of time. They consider sex to be less effective as cardio than brisk walking, as it burns only about 100-200 kcal per hour, which is little raised above a typical resting rate of about 60 kcal per hour.","[Megan and Cueball have sex up against a wall.]  [Megan and Cueball have sex standing in an armchair.]  [Megan and Cueball have sex in a swing, swaying above a table with a flower vase on it.]  [Fitocracy.

949: File Transfer,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/949:_File_Transfer,internet,"Every time you email a file to yourself so you can pull it up on your friend's laptop, Tim Berners-Lee sheds a single tear.","Cueball is trying to help two people, his friend and his friend's cousin, exchange a 25 MB file. Most people know how to use email to send files through the internet, but 25 MB exceeds the attachment size limit of most email services. The reason there is a limit is because every email has to be transferred between several mail transfer agents, and each one has to temporarily store a copy of the email. Space constraints on those mail servers means that they must impose size limits, and an email with such a large attachment will therefore not be delivered.  The next option is to upload the file to an FTP server (FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, as opposed to HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol), used to transfer files between computers on a shared network, such as the internet. However, FTP servers are a touch more esoteric than a mere email attachment, and many internet users don't have access to one of their own.  Web hosting is simply the ability to create a website and store all the data for said website on a server which is connected to the internet. If Cueball's friend's cousin had the ability to do that, sharing the file would be as easy as putting a copy of it in an accessible directory and sending the link to the desired recipient.  Megaupload was one of many sites on the internet that recognizes most users' inability to host large files on their own, and so offers to host large files, sometimes for free, sometimes for a small fee. The payoff is that in order to make such a service profitable, many of these sites are cluttered with banner and pop up ads in a mad effort to squeeze as much ad revenue out of every page view as possible. It's not a dealbreaker for some, but Cueball seems to think it'll be too much for his friend's cousin to handle.  AIM direct connect was a file sharing system on AOL Instant Messenger, which was already suffering severe drops in popularity by the year 2000. Clearly, Cueball is grasping at straws here: anybody desperate enough to invoke the name of AOL as a solution instead of a problem must be at their wits' end.  Dropbox is a program with a web-based GUI that automates file sharing between two computers on the internet. But this solution also has its issues, as it requires that at least the sending party has a Dropbox account. Installing Dropbox software is not actually required, since Dropbox also provides a web interface for uploading and downloading files. At the time of the comic's publication, Dropbox was still relatively new and unknown, thus why it is not Cueball's first suggestion.  While Cueball is still explaining Dropbox, the friend's cousin has copied the file to a USB drive and physically transported it to the friend's house, circumventing the internet entirely. It's not an elegant solution, but sometimes traditional methods are the most efficient ways to get something done.  When used to transfer files between computers in the same room or building, this same approach is referred to as sneakernet. This comic is also an illustration of what Andy Tanenbaum said in 1989: Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway. Sneakernet was examined in this What If article.  Tim Berners-Lee is considered to be the inventor of the World Wide Web. In the title text, Randall implies that he would be disturbed by the need today to use two separate protocols (smtp for sending the file as an email attachment and http for retrieving the file from the mail server web interface) to perform a third, unrelated, obvious function such as file transfer.  Note that this is similar to the later 1810:_Chat_Systems.","[Cueball stands near a computer, talking on the phone to another person.]  Cueball: You want your cousin to send you a file? easy. He can email it to- ...Oh, it's 25 MB? Hmm... Cueball: Do either of you have an FTP server? No, right. Cueball: If you had web hosting, you could upload it... Cueball: Hm. We could try one of those MegaShareUpload sites, but they're flaky and full of delays and porn popups. Cueball: How about AIM Direct Connect? Anyone still use that? Cueball: Oh, wait, Dropbox! It's this recent startup from a few years back that syncs folders between computers. You just need to make an account, install the- Cueball: Oh, he just drove over to your house with a USB drive? Cueball: Uh, cool, that works too.  [Caption below the panel:] I like how we've had the internet for decades, yet ""sending files"" is something early adopters are still figuring out how to do."
979: Wisdom of the Ancients,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/979:_Wisdom_of_the_Ancients,internet,All long help threads should have a sticky globally-editable post at the top saying 'DEAR PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURE: Here's what we've figured out so far ...',"This comic refers to a common experience that those trying to solve tech problems have. Typically, people search on Google to try to find solutions to the problem. Sometimes the solution can be found on a software program's website, but the most helpful solutions frequently come from discussions on message boards, particularly for more obscure problems. This is because the odds are rather high that someone else, years ago, had the same problem you're having and resolved it.  However, in this comic, Cueball is unable to find any mention of the problem he's currently facing except for one forum post about it that did not include the problem's solution. This is akin to finding an FAQ with questions but no answers.  The title is a satirical reference to the notion that the ""ancients,"" i.e. from thousands of years ago, possessed knowledge that has been lost to the centuries (such as exactly how Stonehenge was built), and that artifacts from those times do not fully divulge such knowledge. The fact that the ""ancient"" referred to in the comic is from 2003 (only 8 years before the comic was published) is an exaggeration of the feeling that the forum poster is lost to the sands of time, but in some sense this feeling is nonetheless true, since Cueball is unlikely to be able to contact her or him.   The title text is a suggestion to forums to be aware of the fact that people are likely going to come across such posts in the future and therefore to provide handy summaries of the most helpful conclusions of long threads for them, since combing through several false starts and failed attempts to resolve a problem can be quite tedious.  In 1722: Debugging the title text also mentions googling an error message, explaining what it means if you get zero results.  http://www.mirrorsoferis.com/forum/thread05232003a.html","[A poem is written outside and right justified along the left edge of the panel to the right.]    Never have I felt so close to another soul   And yet so helplessly alone   As when I Google an error   And there's one result   A thread by someone with the same problem   And no answer   Last posted to in 2003  [Cueball stands in front of his desk, having risen so the chair has moved away behind him.

1031: s/keyboard/leopard/,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1031:_s/keyboard/leopard/,internet,Problem Exists Between Leopard And Chair,"Randall's browser looks like Google Chrome and he has installed at least four extensions on it, which explains the little symbols to the right of the address bar. Extensions are small programs that install into your Internet browser and change the Web pages as you view them. Some make pages easier to read, some remove ads (the third extension is AdBlock) and so on.   For the joke in this comic, an extension accidentally replaces the word ""keyboard"" with ""leopard"" in a regex (or regular expression). In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means to ""match"" (specify and recognize) patterns in text, such as particular characters or words. The command to substitute/replace a string is ""s"", e.g. ""s/old/new/"" replaces any occurrence of ""old"" with ""new"". The title therefore contains the command to change ""keyboard"" into ""leopard"".  It's not clear what the extension Randall installed was actually supposed to do, but most extensions that revolve around text replacement are humorous in nature (such as Cloud to Butt, which replaces all instances of ""the cloud"" with ""my butt"").  The title text references the common IT phrase ""Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair"" or PEBKAC, which means that the problem is caused by the user, not by any failure of the computer.  There has been several comics using substitutions, both before and after this one.","[There are two browser windows open on a computer screen.] [The first browser window, taking up most of the screen, but partly blocked by the other window at the bottom, has a Wikipedia article open.

1058: Old-Timers,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1058:_Old-Timers,internet,"You were on the internet before I was born? Well, so was I.","In this comic the man with the beard thinks he is Leet and tries to show this to his conversations partner by calling her noob (see also n00b). He claims that he has been on the internet since the BBS days, and thus long before his conversation partner was even born.  A Bulletin Board System, or BBS, is an online service based on microcomputers running appropriate software. They were the precursors to modern day online forums. So no one could have been on-line longer than him.  However, he is up against Science Girl who tells him he is wrong. She explains that her parents took samples of their sperm and egg and sequenced the DNA. The resulting genome was then e-mailed to the Venter Institute where they synthesized the genome and used this to create the egg and sperm that became Science Girl.  The J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) is a non-profit genomics research institute founded by J. Craig Venter, Ph.D. in October 2006. Although what Science Girl is describing may be possible this comic must take place in the future as this has not yet been used to create human beings.  Her point though is, that the man is wrong when he says that he has been on the internet. When you are ""on-line"" you are really just looking on the screen where the results found ""on"" the internet is displayed. So he has been looking at the internet. The girls genome (which is basically the closest you can come to the data a computer would need to create you) has been send on-line in an e-mail. So in her words, she has actually been there.  Objectively, the Science Girl is just as bad as her adult conversational partner; simply being the most significant advancement in test tube babies in over two decades doesn't prove anything about your personal knowledge or experience. Subjectively, however, her reputation alone is more than enough to stun and thus ""defeat"" anyone who actually understands her special heritage, as well as of course her pun and correction regarding being and looking on the internet.  The title text is another common retort from ""old timers"" that they have been doing X since before the younger person was born. In this case, Science Girl accepts that the old timer was ""on the Internet"" before she was born, but so was she... At least in the form of her genetic information.","[A man with black hair and a neck beard types away at his computer screen.] Man (typing): Whatever, noob.

In many cases, finding the best organization can be difficult and/or can take a long time. To skip this problem, Cueball ""Just Gives Up"" and puts all his items and furniture into a box labeled  ""Misc"" for miscellaneous, with the exception of his laptop, cable modem and router.  The title text is a take on the popular website Lifehacker which includes all sorts of posts on how to ""hack"" your life and improve your life.","[One big plain room with a person sitting on the floor with a laptop on one side, a modem and wireless router on the other, and a big box full of the usual accoutrements of living in the middle, with ""MISC"" written on the side.]  Home Organization Tip: Just Give Up."
1081: Argument Victory,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1081:_Argument_Victory,internet,"Really, the comforting side in most conspiracy theory arguments is the one claiming that anyone who's in power has any plan at all.","Cueball is arguing  with a conspiracy theorist, who is sitting in front of his computer talking back. They are probably using Skype, FaceTime, or another video calling service, as Cueball later asks  him to watch closely, holding his phone up to show the other guy what he is doing.   Cueball's opponent seems to ignore all reliable sources, like Snopes and Wikipedia on top of several journals, instead preferring sources that are seemingly not credible (but that do agree with him). These conspiracy "".net"" pages typically just have a black background and uses several different sizes of fonts, the larger (and probably also in bright colors), the more convincing, seems to be the belief, and Cueball cannot take these kind of sources seriously. "".net"" websites can be made by anyone and have little limitations. The maker of a "".net"" does not need to show sources of information, or even their name. As such, "".net"" websites are notoriously unreliable and often have viruses or other malware. The Truth about Black Helicopters is an example of one such website, supposedly explaining the truth behind government ""Black Helicopters"".  The conspiracy theorist insists that by trusting reliable sources, Cueball is simply buying in to the cover-up. Cueball says he can win the argument, and will show him how, and then ceases to argue further in favor of going down a waterslide while holding up the phone to show the other guy how to have a good time. Since conspiracy theorists tend to be intransigent, Cueball sees himself as the victor after ceasing to argue with a guy who cannot be argued with, and instead decides to have some fun. This is even improved by the fact that it makes his opponent angry.   The joke here is also in the title of the comic which is Argument Victory something that is very hard to achieve by on the web... Cueball won this victory not by arguing but by stopping this argument he was having with someone that could/would not be argued with.  The title text points out that belief in a conspiracy presupposes that those with the power to carry out the conspiracy actually have a plan, a situation which might be found more ""comforting"" than the alternative that those in power are just muddling through with no plan at all. This concept is revisited in 1274: Open Letter.","[Cueball, looking right, is talking at his smartphone while holding it up in front of his head using both hands.] Cueball: I can't believe you're so wrong.

Just remember to constantly bring up how cool it is that birds are dinosaurs and you'll be set.,"Cueball lost the server password and is asking Megan what it is. Megan correctly comments that she can't be sure through text-based messages that it's really Cueball asking for the password; it could be someone impersonating him attempting to socially engineer access to the server. Cueball answers by starting to develop a cryptographic protocol they can use for proof of identity, probably something like OTR Messaging as implemented in many XMPP chat clients or Feige–Fiat–Shamir identification scheme. In reality, it would already be too late for that — they should have prepared something beforehand. Before he even finishes, Megan answers ""It's you"", meaning that no one else is so geeky that they would answer like that. Cueball, dismayed at the fact that his geekery has become a defining characteristic of his and also at a lost opportunity to devise his protocol, shouts ""No!"".  In the title text, Randall suggests that this is, in fact, his own personality, and that anyone reading the comic can now impersonate him. For a bonus, he notes his own fascination with the fact that birds are just modern dinosaurs, which one could use to impersonate him as well.","Cueball: Hey, I lost the server password. What is it, again?  Megan: It's— ...Wait. How do I know it's really you?  Cueball: Ooh, good question! I bet we can construct a cool proof-of-identity protocol.

'But then won't the uploader get suspicious that it pauses at 301+ for a while? Why don't we just forge the number entirel--' ::BLAM:: 'The Council of 299 is adjourned.',"YouTube (a video sharing site) used to have an odd quirk in its view counter. When a video hits 301 views, the view counter briefly stops updating. This means that YouTube is checking the views to make sure that no foul play is going on. The choice of the number 301 is due to a harmless off-by-one error; Numberphile produced a video that explains all this very well. At times the number 301 catches some YouTubers off guard — for very popular videos, it may appear that the video has more likes than views.  YouTube added a ""301+"" to indicate that the video has reached the 301 point and is awaiting review.  More recently, however, YouTube has abolished this[1].  The author plays with the near coincidence of this number, and a conspiracy theory entity known as the Committee of 300. In this case, the video's first 300 views come from each of the Committee's council members who determine if the video will go viral. The video is then released to the public by sending it to a regular person (Cueball in this comic) making the total number of views 301.  The title text elaborates on this by explaining that the council also hypnotizes somebody to make him think they uploaded and shared that particular video.  According to the title text, the council does not seem to tolerate contradiction, because the member that suggests changing 301 to a random number to avoid suspicion is shot and silenced permanently and removed from the council.","[A secret society meets in a darkened chamber; a kitschy video involving two people and an RC helicopter is projected onto the background.] Master: ...then it is settled.

My infrastructure consists of a bunch of Verizon wifi hotspots that I sign up for and then cancel at the end of the 14-day return period.,"The comic references Google's new Project Loon, a balloon powered Internet service which was officially announced June 14, 2013 and is currently in proof-of-concept testing stages. A test above New Zealand, involving about 30 balloons and about 50 users, was successfully conducted on June 16. The project, taglined ""Internet for Everyone"", is intended to eventually provide Internet access to people in rural areas and in disaster areas that have limited or no access to land-based Internet services.  Randall is poking fun at the tagline ""Internet for Everyone"" — meant to mean anyone could have Internet access regardless of location — by instead literally bringing the Internet to Cueball, who retired in a deserted area, away from all technology, to read a standard paper book. In the comic, one of the balloons sneaks up on Cueball before speaking and startling Cueball, effectively becoming a nuisance, interrupting Cueball's reading of a book and leaving Cueball wondering what has happened. In Randall's world, the tagline could be restated as ""Internet for Everyone — whether they want it or not"".  The title text describes Randall's own plan to provide rural internet. He will operate in a region where Verizon Wi-Fi infrastructure already exists, and take advantage of their 14-day return policy to effectively obtain internet access for free, which he will then sell under his own brand.","[Cueball sits on a hill reading a book.] [Cueball remains engrossed in the book.

The demo is renowned for the numerous technologies Douglas' team introduced, which the comic references before sliding into apocryphal claims. At the first panel he presents various inventions, including the Computer Mouse. The second panel contains the opening lyrics of Leonard Cohen's song Hallelujah. The ""Secret Chord"" is a reference to his ""Chord Key Set"" he also presented at this demo. This relatively obscure device, essentially a piano with five keys, was meant as an alternative to the well-known keyboard. The third is a reference to contemporary internet memes, specifically cat pictures and YOLO.  The title text is a reference to recent revelations about spying by the United States National Security Agency, which was making headlines when this comic was published. While it might have seemed like an advantage at the time, in a modern context this aspect of the internet appears disturbing.  Several of the inventions presented by Douglas in 1968 were years ahead of their time, and many would prove to be very influential in the development of personal computing. Some of the technologies demonstrated found success in the following decades, while others did not.

1238: Enlightenment,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1238:_Enlightenment,internet,"But the rules of writing are like magic spells. If you never acquire them, then not using them says nothing.","This comic is a reference to a scene one might imagine in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in which Yoda expresses doubt in a young Anakin's potential to join the Jedi order. Yoda delivers a speech similar to the one that Ponytail gives here, except that the end of the sequence he presents is ""the dark side"" instead of ""being an asshole"". Yoda is ultimately correct; Anakin's fears lead him to join the dark side so that he may keep his loved ones from dying; this is at the expense of the stability of the galaxy, however, and his actions are in vain, as his wife dies nonetheless. The circle on the ground is also taken from the Star Wars scene, and Cueball is presumably in the Mace Windu role.  Here, Randall compares Anakin's decision to join the dark side to the propensity of many Internet commenters to correct others on their spelling and grammar, and to the extreme prevalence of criticism over commendation or confirmation. Randall's point is that correcting people, like joining the dark side, ultimately stems from insecurity.  Ponytail and Cueball challenge Megan to type the sentence ""I heard you're idea's and their definately good"", which contains four common misspellings (you're instead of your, idea's instead of ideas [see greengrocers' apostrophe], their instead of they're, and definately instead of definitely) and a grammatical error (a missing comma before the word ""and""). Regarding the content, this sentence is one that is highly unlikely to be ever read in an internet argument, as almost every time people still have things they claim to know better about. Megan thus can't bring herself to typing this sentence, having spent so much time judging others for their trivial errors, even when they're saying helpful things like the sentence in question. Instead, it is strongly implied that she smashes the computer and runs away — demonstrating the sort of anger that ""Grammar Nazis"" and internet wiseacres like her can feel about punctuation and spelling errors, and about content-related errors respectively. Cueball and Ponytail remark on this, both failing to use apostrophes.  The title text refers to Terry Pratchett's novel Equal Rites, in which the characters discover that the most powerful magic is not using magic — with the distinction that not using magic because you don't know how is not the same as choosing to refrain from using magic when you do know how. Randall is comparing this with use or misuse of the rules of Standard English: not even knowing the rules is not admirable, whereas knowing the rules but choosing to disregard them is. There is also a double meaning - not writing anything at all is in fact ""saying nothing"".","[The two Internet Bodhisattvas Ponytail and Cueball lecture Megan encircled by a wheel placed upon the ground.] Ponytail: To achieve internet enlightenment, you must free yourself from insecurity. Megan: But insecurity keeps me humble! Ponytail: No. Insecurity leads to conceit. Conceit leads to judgment. Judgment leads to being an asshole.

This often manifests as the poster simply posting the word ""First"" without contributing any actual content to the discussion.  In the first two panels, Cueball stares at his screen, implying that a long time passes before he finally points this out. He has probably submitted a post and is awaiting for comments that are not coming. Cueball might actually have mixed feelings about the practice slowly dying out. However, someone offscreen is worried he will jinx it, encouraging more people to do so. See also 269: TCMP and 1019: First Post.  The title text sarcastically states that no new annoying internet behaviors have emerged since the ""first post"" trend began which would continue to annoy users: a fact which is clearly wrong to anyone who spends a length of time on the internet.

1269: Privacy Opinions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1269:_Privacy_Opinions,internet,I'm the Philosopher until someone hands me a burrito.,"According to the title, the comic is about opinions on internet privacy in general. Six positions are offered as options. Four of the positions are tagged negatively by the author by their subtitles alone: the Crypto Nut, the Conspiracist, the Nihilist, and the Exhibitionist, all of which have negative valences in contemporary English. That the viewer is encouraged to identify negatively with these four positions is further encouraged by the content of the panels, as those characters are depicted either as having such boring lives that they have no need for privacy (the Crypto Nut, the Nihilist), or as being crazy (the Conspiracist, the Exhibitionist).  A fifth position, the Philosopher, is tagged somewhat ambivalently by the author: Megan, or possibly a look-alike, is depicted as boring her interlocutor, yet in the title text, the author admits that he is usually the Philosopher. Also, ""Philosopher"" in vernacular English is neutrally valenced, potentially having the ability to expound either wisdom (sophia) or sophistry. It is also a synonym for Sage, the sixth position. As the author condones his own movement from Philosopher to Sage, he thus indicates that the Philosopher is to be viewed negatively, even if it is a tempting position to hold.  The title of the sixth position, the ""Sage"", is positively valenced in contemporary English, and the author in the title text states that once he obtains a ""burrito"" – i.e., a ""real"" thing, he switches from the Philosopher to the Sage. The internal evidence presented thus far therefore is entirely consistent; the author encourages the reader to identify with the Sage. However, the choice of Beret Guy to represent the Sage undercuts this somewhat as Beret Guy is frequently seen as bizarrely disconnected from reality in a way that is maladaptive (e.g. 1030: Keyed) and overly obsessed with food to the point of creating trouble and potential self-harm (e.g. 452: Mission).  By presenting five negatively tagged positions followed by a positively tagged sixth and final one, the author follows a rhetorical commonplace of listing and refuting a number of positions one by one, concluding with the favored and best one, which is not refuted and should be accepted both on its own merits and by virtue of being the last one standing. The comic therefore implies that no other (significant) positions exist.  Having completed the rhetorical analysis of the comic, we are now in a position to understand the meaning of ""Internet Privacy"".  Panels #3 and 5 directly reference the American NSA. Panel #5's ""exhibitionist"" also references Google, but the characters in the panel appear to be NSA agents (one wears an official cap and they are viewing the exhibitionist on an official, government-looking monitor). Likewise, the focus of the ""Nihilist"" is that the joke is on the people who gather the data, rather than those who are subsequently able to make use of it (such as Facebook's users rather than ""Facebook"" itself; i.e., Facebook's employees and, by extension, its advertisers). The content of the actual data is only mentioned in panels #2, 4, and 5, and in each panel, it is suggested that it is meaningless or trivial. The Sage underscores the notion that any data known about him does not bother him, and therefore must be meaningless or trivial. The reader is thus encouraged to believe that it does not actually matter whether others discover personal data about him/her.  The comic is therefore what social theorists call reductive, because it reduces the range of possibilities of ""Opinions on Internet Privacy"" to an artificially and simplistically narrow subset; in this case, individuals concerned with government or corporate agencies using data that they have gathered on individuals, and the futility of worrying about such things. The comic does not admit the possibility of other ""opinions on internet privacy"" – namely, that individuals might have legitimate concerns with governmental or corporate uses of their data, let alone other individuals' access to data that is assembled and distributed by corporations such as Facebook. The comic likewise does not consider the possibility of individuals having more interesting lives than the characters depicted, and therefore very real concerns about their privacy due to the activities that they engage in that are potentially more career limiting (should they be discovered) than obsessing about cryptography or eating a burrito.  The comic is ""functionally"" reductive, as opposed to ""intentionally"" reductive, because the reduction is the function or effect of the comic for readers who read it straightforwardly. There is not enough internal evidence in the comic to maintain that the author intentionally excluded other viable opinions on internet privacy; it could be that they are just not on his radar. For example, we do not have enough information in the comic to claim that the author is against civil rights; it could be simply that he doesn't often think about them. Likewise, it would exceed the evidence of the comic to claim that the author believes that schoolteachers who use the internet to facilitate legal but frowned-upon sexual behaviors should lose their jobs if they are found out due to internet privacy breaches; it could be that the author simply hasn't bothered to worry about these matters if they don't affect him personally. This adjudication – whether the comic is ""intentionally"" reductive or not – may only be made on the basis of external evidence; that is, data known about the author from sources beyond this comic.  An alternative interpretation of the title text is that it is not Randall speaking his own opinion, but instead represents Beret Guy's (i.e. the ""Sage's"") perspective. Randall may indeed have some concern with internet privacy, which would be consistent with the views on open-source security expressed in 463: Voting Machines, for example. In other cases, such as 1490: Atoms and 1419: On the Phone, the title text has been used as additional, farcical statements made by characters in the strip, rather than as Randall expressing his own views. Under this interpretation, Beret Guy would be prone to philosophizing about security, but then be easily distracted by a burrito; this is consistent with Beret Guy's general behavior.  Additional observations about the comic follow.  The release of the comic on this date could be to coincide with the premiere of South Park's 17th season on the same date, which starts with an episode (Let Go, Let Gov) in which Cartman discovers that the NSA has been spying on him.  The title text is to suggest that he enjoys burritos so much that being handed one even while philosophizing (his natural state) would stop him in his tracks to eat the burrito, thus becoming a pseudo-sage concerned only with the burrito at the exclusion of the topic of internet security. The burrito is later mentioned as a way to stay connected to the real word (compared to the world of art) in 1496: Art Project.","Opinions on Internet Privacy The Philosopher: Megan: ""Privacy"" is an impractical way to think about data in a digital world so unlike the one in which our soci-- Ponytail:  So bored.   The Crypto Nut: Cueball: My data is safe behind six layers of symmetric and public-key algorithms. Friend: What data is it? Cueball: Mostly me emailing with people about cryptography.  The Conspiracist: Cueball talks to Megan. Cueball: These leaks are just the tip of the iceberg. There's a warehouse in Utah where the NSA has the entire iceberg. I don't know how they got it there.  The Nihilist: Megan: Joke's on them, gathering all this data on me as if anything I do means anything.  The Exhibitionist: Cueball is watching a surveillance console, Officer Ponytail stands behind him. Console: Mmmm, I sure hope the NSA isn't watching me bite into these juicy strawberries!! Oops, I dripped some on my shirt! Better take it off. Google, are you there? Google, this lotion feels soooo good. Cueball: Um.  The Sage: Beret Guy and Cueball sitting at a table. Beret Guy: I don't know or care what data anyone has about me. Data is imaginary. This burrito is real."
1279: Reverse Identity Theft,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1279:_Reverse_Identity_Theft,internet,"I asked a few friends whether they'd had this happen, then looked up the popularity of their initials/names over time. Based on those numbers, it looks like there must be at least 750,000 people in the US alone who think 'Sure, that's probably my email address' on a regular basis.","Identity theft is the criminal method of assuming the identity of an unsuspecting person, usually to get credit in their name. While this is done deliberately, the comic introduces the idea of reverse identity theft: An older person with little knowledge of computers involuntarily uses another person's email address because he or she supposed it to be their own. Since most email addresses follow a generic pattern, they simply adapt the pattern to conform with their own name, unaware that someone with the same initial and last name already owns the address.  Most internet users face at some point the message that their desired email address is ""already taken"". Because email addresses must be unique and only a limited set of characters is allowed, people with common names usually add numbers to their name. The comic suggests that elder people might easily forget that they had to take, for instance, [email protected] when they signed up. Instead, the person would tell everyone that their address was [email protected], since that follows the generic pattern and is the most intuitive assumption for them. They are in complete ignorance that the address belongs, in fact, to whomever claimed it first. In this case, the address belongs to Randall himself. (In case you're wondering, yes, [email protected] is Randall's email according to the xkcd blag.)  The comic has Cueball call an older person, who apparently gave Cueball's email address to the phone company, which now emails Cueball the bills - this could have been avoided if said company confirmed an email address first. The person is not able to understand why this is not their email address (as it corresponds with their name) and is also very confused how Cueball got their phone number. The latter reveals a major problem of reverse identity theft: Using another person's email address for your own business matters exposes your own identity. The owner of the address could easily take advantage of the situation, leading to a scenario of regular identity theft. Fortunately, Cueball seems to be more honest; Black Hat probably would not have given any warning.  Due to the sheer mass of people online, nearly all simple nicknames are already taken; and the number of possible combinations is further diminished by services (e.g., Gmail) which ignore the dot sign altogether and does not allow the use of hyphens or underscores. This policy is designed to prevent fraud, but it forces users to add numbers or other unique identifiers to their names. Apart from the scenario addressed in the comic, another subsequent problem is the use of wrong email addresses by third parties. Someone sending sensitive personal information to the wrong recipient can just as easily expose a person's identity as the person himself.  In the end, there is no practical solution to the problems arising from the uniqueness of usernames and email addresses. Instead, it is simply the consequence of naming itself: While a name was originally intended to distinguish its bearer from a limited number of people (e.g. the rest of the village), the Internet makes it necessary to distinguish ourselves from the entire rest of the world (or at least everybody online).  Note that Gmail ignores everything behind a plus sign. Like ignoring dots, this is used as a way to create email aliases. The plus sign in the formula used in the comic should therefore considered to be only an indicator for concatenation, not a literal character in the address.    Note from Editor: I have a hyphenated 1st name and 2 mid-names, and I use all of those initials then my last name.","If your email address is [First initial]+[Last name]@gmail.com you gradually get to know lots of older people who have the same name pattern  Cueball: Yes, I know it would make sense if that were your email address, but it's not. Person on the phone: But how did you get my number? Cueball: Your phone bill."
1305: Undocumented Feature,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1305:_Undocumented_Feature,internet,"And it doesn't pop up a box every time asking you to use your real name. In fact, there's no way to set your name at all. You just have to keep reminding people who you are.","An undocumented feature is a part of a software product that is not explained in the documentation for the product. Cueball has found such a feature, a chat room intended to ask for help, accessible through the help page of some unnamed old Windows utility. The people who found the chat room started out using it for its intended purpose (helping users of the utility by contacting other users), however as time has passed they have become friends and enter the chat only to talk to each other, with no relation to computer problems.  A virtual machine (or VM) is a computer program designed to emulate the hardware of a full computer. In this case, users of the old chat room create VMs only to have the old operating system installed which included the utility program. They use this setup only to access the old chat room. This is shown in the third panel where Cueball is using a modern laptop to enter the chatroom (presumably by means of a VM), whereas Ponytail is most likely using an old computer (as evidenced by the CRT monitor).  A chat room like this must be hosted on some outside server, so the narrator of the comic wonders who runs this server. An obvious thought about this is if and when the server will be shut down, effectively cutting all communication among chat users. Another obvious thought is why the utility author is still maintaining the chat server, since its original purpose of allowing communication between users with problems with the utility program is no longer an issue as everybody has migrated to more modern systems. The comic suggests that the reason for doing this can be a bored sysadmin, who is just reading the messages of the chat users and following their lives but never writing anything. This would turn the chat room into a soap opera for the sysadmin.  The Deep Web is a term used to refer to any information which is available online, but is hard to find (usually because there are no links to that information in web pages). The chat room described would be an example of this. From this point on, the comic takes an existentialist turn (a frequent xkcd trait), talking about how life is short, everything has to end, etc.  The last panel is a reference to Facebook's recent announcement that it would start autoplaying video ads, and the title text refers to YouTube requiring its users to use their real-life identities instead of just nicknames. These last parts of the comics somehow reveal that the point of the whole comic is just to complain about aggressive money-driven policies used by modern social networks in general and Facebook in particular. It is hinted that Randall would prefer older technologies, where limited resources would forbid autoplaying videos or huge databases with every detail of every user's life.  It's possible that the comic is about an actual chat room, but more likely it is a complete invention, since if it were real someone would have been able to trace its origin. However, if it is real, the participants would not want to confirm this in order to protect their privacy.  The title text mentions the simplicity of this chat; even user names do not exist and other users could only be identified by their behavior because the user names are random and can change on every login.  There are many examples of undocumented features in programs written for old versions of Windows, for example:","[A support window is shown.] An old Windows utility has an undocumented feature. If you open ""help"" and click on the background, you get dropped into a ""support"" chat room. Support Window: Launching support forum...  [An active conversation between two people is shown.] Only a few of us ever found it. But we became friends.  [Cueball and Ponytail are at computers.] We kept launching the program to check in. Eventually some of us were running VMs just to keep accessing it.  [Another conversation.] As the Internet aged, so did we.  [Three question marks.] We don't know who runs the server. We don't know why it's still working so many years later. Maybe we're some sysadmin's soap opera.  [A group of people are shown in a bubble.] It will probably vanish someday, but for now it's our meeting place. Our hideaway.  [The bubble is now smaller, and some parts of a web are shown.] A life's worth of chat,  [More of the web is shown.] Buried in the deep web.  [A flat landscape is shown with the sun at the horizon.] But even if it lasts forever, we won't. When we're gone, who will remember us?  [Cueball and Hairy are shown standing together in a bubble.] Who will remember this strange little world and the friendships we built here?  Nobody.  [An empty bubble is shown.] This place is irrelevant. Ephemeral. One day it will be forgotten.  [The bubble starts to fade away.] And so will we  [The bubble has almost completely faded away.]  [The bubble is now completely gone.]  But at least it doesn't have fucking video ads."
1306: Sigil Cycle,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1306:_Sigil_Cycle,internet,"The cycle seems to be 'we need these symbols to clarify what types of things we're referring to!' followed by 'wait, it turns out words already do that.'","In computer programming, a variable is a way of storing information temporarily, for use later in the program. There are different types of variables, called data types, such as integers, strings, characters, and booleans, all of them holding different types of information. Integers hold whole numbers, strings hold text, and so on. Variables traditionally have names that identify their purpose, and a programmer should usually be able to infer from this variable name what type of variable it is. For example, if you want to store the name of the customer in a catalogue service, you might store the text in a string variable called ""NameOfCustomer"". Because it is fairly clear that names are made up of text, it is logical that this variable would be a string variable - if you didn't have any other information about it.  A sigil in computer programming is a symbol that appears before the variable name. It is an alternative method of telling someone who is reading the program code what data type the variable is. Rather than relying on logic, then, to know that NameOfCustomer is a string, you might use a sigil ""$"" before the variable name, as in $NameOfCustomer, which would specify that the variable can hold text. Sigils can also specify the scope of a variable, which refers to where the variable can be used in a program, and which parts of the program can access that variable. Sigils are useful in some ways because you don't have to refer to previous program code or find where the variable is declared (created) to know what data type it is. They also provide some level typing in languages that do not explicitly declare the type of the variable.  Most programming languages have a different method for storing variables, although some languages may use the same variable types under different names. The following are the programming languages referenced in the comic and how they use variables.  As is noted by the comic, the use of sigils to indicate types of variables varies between programming languages, from strict enforcement in languages like Perl, to their complete absence in languages like C++ (but see Hungarian Notation). The comic notes that the use of sigils seems to be cyclic, especially if you count things like hashtags as extensions of the pattern.  The title text describes the two competing influences responsible for the cycle: The first impulse finds sigils useful to elucidate the type of the variable, especially when variable names are not very descriptive, while the latter impulse notes that descriptive variable names are much more useful for that purpose, especially in extensible languages where the built-in types form only a small part of the type system.","A sinusoidal curve is shown. Y axis: Odds that the words I type will start with some weird symbol X axis: Time Data labels: [at first peak] $QBASIC, [at first trough] C++, [at second peak] $BASH, @$PERL, [at second trough] PYTHON, [at third peak] +GOOGLE, @TWITTER, #HASHTAGS"
1309: Infinite Scrolling,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1309:_Infinite_Scrolling,internet,Maybe we should give up on the whole idea of a 'back' button. 'Show me that thing I was looking at a moment ago' might just be too complicated an idea for the modern web.,"Infinite scrolling is a technique in web design where a large data set is displayed as a seemingly infinite list, but in reality only the visible part of the list (and the surrounding data) is rendered. This is done to work around memory limitations of old browsers and mobile devices or to save on data transfer size.  The problem with this technique is that if you navigate from this page to a different page and go back, the location of the scrolled data set is often lost and the top of the data set is displayed again. Also it is usually not possible to point a URL directly to a certain section of the infinite list, a practice known as deep linking. For these reasons, many prefer pagination, the method traditionally used in books, over infinite scrolling.  In this comic Megan is handling the book gingerly as if it were a device with a touchscreen where the book is displayed as an infinite scrolling text. Touching a link would navigate away from the list and the current reading position would be lost.  In the title text it is an ironic suggestion that the ""back"" button is now useless. The back-button is supposed to give you this functionality but due to the failure to implement continuous scrolling sites and deep-linking correctly they are typically useless when the user is reading infinite-scrolling data (or worse, flat-out counterproductive, giving you the wrong page).","[Megan stands at a desk, reading a book, touching it very gingerly. Cueball is standing behind her. Cueball: Why are you turning the pages like that? Megan: If I touch the wrong thing, I'll lose my place and have to start over.  If books worked like infinite-scrolling webpages"
1333: First Date,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1333:_First_Date,internet,"I sympathize with the TPP protagonist because I, too, have progressed through a surprising number of stages of life despite spending entire days stuck against simple obstacles.","TPP, or Twitch Plays Pokémon, was the first of a creative and radical new variant of streaming gameplay videos created in early 2014 — a few days before this comic was released.  Some consumers enjoyed watching video games being played by other people (usually 'popular' gamers known for entertaining gameplay), thus streaming sites dedicated to streaming gameplay were created. Twitch.tv was one such site.  Whereas traditional video game streams involved the channel broadcaster or another personality playing the game, the channel ""Twitch Plays Pokémon"" recorded a bot playing an emulated game of Pokémon Red for Game Boy. The game inputs given by the bot were based on players' messages in the video stream itself. Thus, the watchers of the stream were playing the game themselves using chat ""commands."" The Pokémon character behaved incredibly erratically, frequently getting ""stuck against simple obstacles"" (as mentioned in the title-text) and moving about in a strange manner (""Why are you up there?""/""Bye...Okay, coming back now"").   Despite this, the character advanced surprisingly far in games. They have beaten the Elite Four and Champion of generations I, II, III, IV, and V, and VI.  Twitch Plays Pokémon is currently on its second season, and will play Pokémon Colosseum next. You can see the state of the player characters' Pokémon and inventory at game end in this Bulbapedia article.   TPP surged in popularity rapidly since its inception, reaching 80,000 channel viewers within five days. Derivative channels (such as 'TwitchPlayers') soon arose, turning ""Twitch Plays..."" into an idea rather than a single channel; that of crowdsourcing a task, such as controlling a single person (as in the Pokémon games) for erratic and often hilarious results. The stream, which is still active as of this writing, has reached memetic status.  In the above comic, Cueball and Megan are on a date. However, Megan is behaving very erratically. Cueball determines that Megan is being ""controlled by Twitch,"" as her behavior matches well with that of the TPP protagonist (whose name, canonically, is Red).   Megan loudly declares at one point that she is ""SAVING"" her 'game progress', referencing the incessant saving in TPP via random button presses. The random ten-letter string she says is reminiscent of the nicknames that all of TPP's Pokémon end up with as the players move haphazardly across the game's keyboard.   Her fascination with the ""cool spiral"" is an allusion to TPP players' fascination with the Helix Fossil, an in-game item. As user input often leads to checking of the in-game backpack followed by erratic commands to handle the items within, it was common for various valuable items to be haphazardly thrown away. However, players quickly discovered that the Helix Fossil, as a key item, could not be tossed. The players' realization that the Helix Fossil would stay in the bag almost permanently throughout the game caused TPP players to jokingly regard it with a near-religious reverence for its constant appearance, with many acting as if the protagonist was ""looking to the Helix for guidance"".  The title text, as explained above, simply is a light-hearted joke from Randall, empathizing with TPP as he has also spent real-life days stuck against simple obstacles, and is surprised by how far he has gotten in life despite this fact.","[Cueball and Megan sit at an intimate dinner table. They have plates and glasses of wine in front of them.] Cueball: So, did you grow up around here? Megan: I love you. Cueball: ... huh? Megan: Waiter! One of everything on the menu.  [Megan stands up. Standing on her chair, she's holding a plate.] Cueball: Why are you up there? Megan: I'm stuck. This plate looks delicious. Aaaoogaoag.

1334: Second,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1334:_Second,internet,"Let me just scroll down and check behind that rock. Annnnd... nope, page copyright year starts with '19'. Oh God, is this a WEBRING?","Google is a popular search engine. Google's searching algorithms are widely regarded as the most accurate and useful. If your search terms were sufficiently detailed, you will be able to find what you were looking for on the first page. Having to view the second page indicates your search terms were too vague or the answer to your query doesn't exist. Especially when the search results are a thousand or more items, only the very first results are mapping to the real idea of the user. The second page is not helpful for the issue.  Cueball, after failing to find his query in the first page of results, takes a curious peek at the second page. This is represented by a not-at-all subtle metaphor in which Cueball is about to wander into a sun-baked desert. According to the title text, he finds one vaguely relevant webpage, but it's over 17 years old.  The title text refers to webrings. Webrings consist of multiple websites that are connected together, usually with a common theme. They connect from one website to the next, eventually leading back to the starting site. They were popular in the 1990s as a way of boosting your search ranking, but newer algorithms in Google and other search engines are now detecting and penalizing web sites for such tactics. Webrings were also used in pre-google days to make it easy to find websites sharing a common theme, but since one site going down broke the ring, they were very inefficient. Seeing a webring means a site has not been updated since the mid 90s.","[Cueball in a desert standing before a rock.] Rock: Greetings, stranger. Rock: Whatever quest drives you, abandon it.

1348: Before the Internet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1348:_Before_the_Internet,internet,We watched DAYTIME TV. Do you realize how soul-crushing it was? I'd rather eat an iPad than go back to watching daytime TV.,"A girl with a ponytail asks Megan what life was like before the Internet. The girl obviously was born after the Internet was invented. Megan responds that life was very boring without computers or mobile phones. This comic appears to be a parody of the common complaint — often done by elder people — that life was better and more fulfilling in the ""good old days"", in that there weren't so many distractions and people could actually get things done that were meaningful. The ages switch roles with the younger character being prepared to believe that life was more fulfilling before technology, and the elder rejecting the proposition.  To Megan, even a more fulfilling and engaging life ""wasn't worth"" the price of what it meant to be bored in the days before smartphones and computers that could go online. Even though the ponytail girl says that she still experiences boredom in spite of having advanced technology to occupy her, Megan assures her that her version of boredom is nothing like what those in the pre-Internet days had to endure. Again, this is a reversal of the typical exchange in which a young person tries to insist that they still have social contact/get out and about/do worthwhile things in their spare time, and the elder person responds, ""Not like we did.""  The title text continues in this vein as Megan talks about what people in her day resorted to doing when they were bored, for lack of anything better to do: they watched daytime TV. Daytime television consisted mainly of soap operas, talk shows, game shows, infomercials and children's programming and is notorious for being, in Megan's words, ""soul-crushing"". To round off the comparison, Megan uses a modern-day metaphor to express her extreme distaste for daytime television, saying that she would rather ""eat an iPad"" than go through that again. In other words, modern-day gadgets are so much better that she'd still have more fun if she were eating them than if she had to go without them.  Megan might just be responding with the opposite of what she's expected to say in this dialogue in order to mess with the younger girl. In reality, life was neither likely to be noticeably more fulfilling or noticeably more boring without technology: it was just life. People are equally capable of wasting their time and of doing worthwhile things regardless of what age they live in, and those who wax nostalgic about an older, better time are liable to forget that. This recalls the Hedonic treadmill theory which states that people will always be at roughly the same level of happiness regardless of positive or negative events or technological advances in civilization.","[Young girl talking to Megan, both holding smartphones.]  Girl: Do you remember before the internet? Megan: Oh yeah, totally. Girl: what was it like? Megan: Not having a phone or computer to distract you? Girl: Yeah. Megan: It was SO. BORING. All the time. I just sat there. It was the worst. Girl: But wasn't it, like, more fulfilling? Engaging? Megan: Wasn't worth it. Girl: I still get bored. Megan: Not like we did."
1361: Google Announcement,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1361:_Google_Announcement,internet,The less popular 8.8.4.4 is slated for discontinuation.,"At the time of this comic's release, Vic Gundotra had recently left Google. Because he was the head of Google+, this has caused many people, including TechCrunch, to theorize that Google+ is going to be shut down, despite the continuing comments from Google that it will remain active and updated.  Google has a history of closing popular services listed.  The comic extrapolates this to an announcement that Google would be closing all its popular services, up to and including its e-mail service, Gmail, and even the core business of the company, its Internet search engine, to wholly concentrate on a relatively obscure part of its product lineup. According to Google, its Public DNS servers (Domain Name System servers), better known by their IPv4 addresses 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, are supposed to be a faster alternative to using one's ISP's DNS servers (because of caching effects due to a large user base), as well as less susceptible to censorship. When Turkey started blocking access to Twitter and YouTube in March 2014, Turkish ISPs first did this on the DNS level by manipulating the results from their own name servers. The most popular workaround was using Google's DNS server instead, so much so that its address was written as graffiti on the side of a building.  The joke may also be related to the fact that 8.8.8.8 is an IP address heavily used by network administrators to perform connectivity tests (ping) because it is easy to remember and fast to type. Google would want to concentrate on this feature to build a business model using that fact.  The reason behind this decision may be that Google considers a DNS server, a fairly low-level component of the Internet's service stack, to be the optimal place to collect information on its users, an accusation leveled at Google ever since it introduced the service.  The title text refers to the impression held by some that Google will shut down services that prove less popular than desired at short notice, even though they may in fact have a significant user base. A recent example of that is the closure of the RSS aggregation service, Google Reader, in July 2013.

1370: President,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1370:_President,internet,Anyone who thinks we're all going to spend the 2032 elections poring over rambling blog posts by teenagers has never tried to read a rambling blog post by a teenager.,"This strip shows a discussion between an adult and a teenager about an aspect of the future. Randall likes this setup, allowing to put in perspective the various ""decay"" predictions and shows his optimism.  Here, the subject is scandal. How will a generation that is documenting and leaving behind a permanent public record of its juvenile misadventures - immature and impolitic writings, photographs of inebriation at parties posted on Facebook, Twitter posts about breakups, etc. - produce successful future politicians? Won't future opposition researchers and reporters have enough embarrassing material to destroy any Millennial's public reputation? In previous generations, juveniles were freer to go through this phase of development without leaving behind a digital record, making it easier to sidestep or paper over rumors of youthful misbehavior. See, e.g., George W. Bush, who dismissed questions about his rumored use of drugs in his youth by saying only, ""When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.""  The child's answer, in addition to teasing the adult about her generation's coming obsolescence, is that the next generation will be fine because in the future no one will care. The title text amplifies this optimistic message, suggesting that old blog posts by former teenagers will just seem boring, not salacious. Randall offers no explanation for this upbeat spin, but it is a recurring topic and some have argued elsewhere that the potential power of Internet-chronicled youthful indiscretions will be defused because everyone will be in the same boat, making future voters (and, in another context, employers) more tolerant of such things.  The strip also contains an existential twist, as shown in the child's answer. It alludes to every generation's dismissal of the next, as actually being due to psychological insecurities. We may disguise our dismissals by attacking their faults & different lifestyles. But in truth, these dismissals are actually rooted in our innate fear of becoming obsolete, useless, surpassed, and lost in a bewildering world that has passed us by.",[Ponytail and Science Girl are walking together.] Ponytail: I can't imagine anyone who grew up on the Internet being able to run for President.

1434: Where Do Birds Go,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1434:_Where_Do_Birds_Go,internet,Water/ice has a lot of weird phases. Maybe asking 'where do birds go when it rains' is like asking 'where does Clark Kent go whenever Superman shows up?',"Cueball searches Google to find out where birds go when it rains. He finds that the question is asked worldwide, across many different languages and websites. A variety of screenshots are shown of different websites and forums where users have asked where birds go when it rains, with at least nine languages shown. The bottom of this panel fades to white, suggesting that the occurrence of these questions stretches on and on. Cueball expresses delight at the idea that this question is the one to which everyone wants to know the answer; worrying about birds getting wet is ""the thing that unites us"".  Later in the comic, a bird in the rain is also searching on the Internet for where birds go when it rains. This is humorously implying that a significant set of these questions are being typed by birds looking for a dry place after being caught in the rain, and not humans. This makes Cueball wrong; worrying about birds getting wet does not unite us. In reality, as the comic states, birds look for shelter so they can stay dry. On a rainy day you can usually find birds in leafy trees, caves or other kinds of cover.  In the Superman comics, Clark Kent is Superman, so you never observe both Clark Kent and Superman simultaneously. By analogy, the title text whimsically suggests that a possible inference from the observation that you never see birds and rain together is that birds are the rain. Perhaps birds are an unknown phase of water. In addition to its familiar phases of ice, vapor, and liquid water, water has more exotic phases such as low-temperature and high-pressure ices and supercritical gases; why not birds?  The title text imbues the question with more philosophical significance than it warrants (prompted, perhaps, by Cueball's earlier hyperbole), and points up the irrationality of the implication that a question must be deep simply because a lot of people ask it, and that such questions demand a complex, radical answer.      Ok, maybe I'm an idiot for asking this, but during the slew of several storms in California the last couple weeks, I began to wonder where the poor birds go to stay dry?

1454: Done,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1454:_Done,internet,"I'm sorry, but the author of this Facebook comment clearly believes you were.","This comic is a joke about the hyperbolic expression shut it down being taken literally. If someone thinks that a device has achieved its goal they shut it down. After an idea or product that people think is well made is created people will joke that the process that created it should be shut down, as if the process has achieved its ultimate purpose. This is most often used sarcastically for an inferior product or idea. Taking things literally is a common theme in the xkcd comics.  Curly-hair sits at a computer anxiously and nervously writing a message to someone she cares about deeply, possibly a child to be adopted or a romantic interest. Curly-hair plans on saving enough money to have the person flown to her location from ""half a world away."" Curly-hair ends the message with a promise to communicate daily until the two are able to meet. When attempting to send the message, however, Curly-hair discovers that their internet connection is down and the message goes unsent.  Ponytail explains there was a ""ridiculous video"" to which someone had commented ""That's it. Shut down the Internet. We're done."" This was taken literally and, because enough people agreed with this comment, the internet was shut down and Curly-hair was left unable to communicate with her love.  The joke being that the internet was creating something far more valuable between Curly-hair and her love than a ridiculous video, thus highlighting the beautiful and far reaching potential impact of the internet. The likelihood of the entire internet being shut down based on a single comment being vanishingly low adds to the humor.  In the final panel Curly-hair states wistfully that she was not done with the internet. The title text is Ponytail's response, which asserts Ponytail's belief that Curly-hair's message could not be important because the Facebook comment asserted that nothing of any significance could come from the internet after the ridiculous video.","Writer (typing): I had started to think I was asking too much, that I needed to settle. And then I found you half a world away.  Writer (typing): I've been saving money. Six months from now, I'll be able to fly you here and support us for a while.  Writer (typing): It's a long wait, but we'll talk every day until then. Maybe this won't work out, but I want to try. What do you think?  Computer: ERROR: Your message could not be sent. [Refresh] Computer: ERROR: No connection. Writer: ??  Writer: Why can't I connect? Ponytail: Someone saw a ridiculous video and said ""That's it. Shut down the Internet. We're done."" So they did.

1573: Cyberintelligence,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1573:_Cyberintelligence,internet,"We had gathered that raw information, but had yet to put it all together.","Ponytail presents her company's FY2015 (Fiscal Year for 2015) budget for cyberintelligence. But is then interrupted with a snide remark about the prefix cyber.  This comic illustrates that some organization spends obscene amounts of money on their ""cyberintelligence"" budget, yet all that spending appears not to have informed them that the prefix ""cyber-"" fell out of fashion years ago. That the prefix could annoy experts were already used in the title text of 1084: Server Problem.  The prefix ""cyber"" is derived from ""Cybernetic,"" which comes from the Greek word κυβερνητικός, meaning skilled in steering or governing. Cyberintelligence could also be called cyber spying i.e. spying in the digital world, one of many ""new"" words with the cyber- prefix. Many were invented in the 1980s and 1990s, following the example of ""cyberspace"", popularized by William Gibson in 1982.  If cyberintelligence departments were given names today, they might be called Internet Intelligence, Virtual Intelligence, Data Intelligence or Online Intelligence departments.  This may be due to the fact that government organizations are typically named by middle-aged or senior officials who are generally less likely to be familiar with the current trends in technology language. They are more likely to stick to the words that were used when they first learned about the technology.  The title text continues the joke by implying the organization learned about the demise of ""cyber-"" yet failed to process or analyze that data. It may also be a reference to the previous comic, which was a link to a survey for xkcd readers.  ""Cyberspace"" and ""cybernetics"", illustrated here, are two of the most common words with that prefix (Cyberspace 6 times as prevalent as cybernetics at their peaks). ""Cyberintelligence"" is shown here. Cyberspace was used 4000 times more often, although the more common spelling splitting it in two words ""Cyber intelligence"" was 1.35 times more used than in one word. But even combining these two versions cyberspace is still used more than 1700 times as often.","[Ponytail, pointing at a chart to her left, with text and two curves on a graph, is talking to someone off-screen to the right.] Ponytail: Our overall FY2015 cyberintelligence budget was $8.1 billion- Off-screen voice: -Yet it wasn't enough to pick up on the fact that no one else had used the prefix ""cyber-"" for like a decade?

1597: Git,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1597:_Git,internet,"If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.","Git is a version control system, used to manage the code in many millions of software projects. It is very powerful, and was amongst the first widely adopted tools to use a distributed version control model (the ""beautiful graph theory tree model""), meaning that there is no single central repository of code. Instead, users share code back and forth to synchronise their repositories, and it is up to each project to define processes and procedures for managing the flow of changes into a stable software product.  Although very powerful, the command line of Git is notoriously difficult to learn and master. Dozens of blog posts and websites (see [1], [2]), and even books ([3], [4]) have been written to help users navigate this complexity.   The difficulty of using Git in common situations is belied by the apparent simplicity of its use in tutorial-style situations. Committing and sharing changes is fairly straightforward, for instance, but recovering from situations such as accidental commits, pushes or bad merges is difficult without a solid understanding of the rather large and complex conceptual model. For instance, three of the top five highest voted questions on Stack Overflow are questions about how to carry out relatively simple tasks: undoing the last commit, changing the last commit message, and deleting a remote branch.  This comic thus explores the difference between the idealised view of Git's architecture, and its actual typical usage. Tutorials for Git tend to use simple systems in their examples, and only deal with the most basic commands to get started, which can create the misleading impression that Git can be used effectively without extensive study.  Due to this problem, compounded by the fact that Git's commands are named differently from similar commands in other version control systems, many users (including Cueball) are unable to use it beyond basic commands, and might try to avoid problems by saving their code outside Git, downloading a newer copy, and then re-applying their changes to the new copy instead of trying to understand and use the features that exist in Git to accomplish this task.  Cueball suggests ""just memoriz[ing] these shell commands and type them to sync up"". He is probably referring to a sequence of commands such as:  As long as every contributor to the project follows these principles, this may suffice for a while. But many situations may cause ""errors"":  In a situation such as a merge conflict, Git will show an error message such as:  Although Git experts can of course deal with such situations, the remedy proposed by Cueball is ""save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy"". That is, to copy the files out of their local repository's working directory, delete that whole structure, then clone the remote repository again (and, implicitly, copy the saved work back again):  Abandoning the old project likely means losing some work, but may be faster and give a more predictable outcome than attempting to salvage the situation. Applying this method to a mere merge conflict issue may prolong the issue however, as the merge conflicts may still be present.  The title text suggests an alternative method for working around Git's complexities, which reflects common practice: knowing a ""Git expert"" who can help in any situation. Such experts are somewhat notorious for waxing lyrically about Git's strengths, so it may be necessary to win their favour by first letting them ramble enthusiastically about it. They will hopefully eventually give the exact commands needed. In practice, the question-and-answer site Stack Overflow is frequently used for this exact purpose.  It may even be a reference to the infamous tweet ""Git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space"" which has been discussed here but it is inconclusive whether a meaningful interpretation exists.  Putting a telephone number of someone who ""understands Git"" into such a file is humorous because:  In short: programmers use version control systems to track changes to code. Most of these version control systems are quite similar and easy to learn if you already know another one. Git is a version control system based on completely different principles, and most programmers find it difficult to wrap their heads around it (although Git also offers a large number of nontrivial benefits over standard version control systems, which is why it is used). Cueball is one of those programmers.  This comic is referenced on what if 153, the page where Randall, due to a problem with git, erroneously posted a draft of his what if? piece on peptides. As of December 17th, 2016 the page reads:  The comic 1296: Git Commit also features Git.","[Cueball points to a computer on a desk while Ponytail and Hairy are standing further away behind an office chair.] Cueball: This is git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree model. Ponytail: Cool. How do we use it? Cueball: No idea. Just memorize these shell commands and type them to sync up. If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy."
1631: Longer Than Usual,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1631:_Longer_Than_Usual,internet,"--> [ Well, this is embarrassing. ] <--'","The comic starts a small flow chart with ""This seems to be taking longer than usual."" It then presents two alternative continuations of the sentence, which radically alter the interpretation of the starting sentence, resulting in humor.  ""This seems to be taking longer than usual"" is an error message displayed by Gmail (see here) and other software, for example Disqus, (see here). We realize the allusion to Gmail by the first continuation, ""Try reloading Gmail if the problem persists"".  In the second continuation, ""Maybe we should just go to bed"", the opening instead refers to a person suffering from sexual performance anxiety, taking ""longer than usual"" to achieve either orgasm or erection, probably despite considerable efforts of their partner. Often such frustration then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that renders orgasm/erection virtually impossible by ruining the mood. In such situations it is likely that one or the other partner becomes frustrated and gives up, suggesting ""let's go to bed"" instead of 'pointlessly' continuing the sexual activity.  The title text ties both interpretations together by referencing an infamous error message given by the Firefox internet browser. As an error message, it fits nicely with the Gmail interpretation of the comic, though it is equally likely to be used as an apology or frustrated slight in the sexual interpretation. It would be a likely next line after ""this is taking longer than usual"". Alternatively, it would be embarrassing to get the two responses confused, thus necessitating a flowchart as a guide.  It could also simply be a jab to people who stay online late even when doing nothing, as when a lag occurs, and finally realising it might be better to switch off the computer and go to bed; or people who stay up late obsessed that ""Someone is wrong on the internet"".  This is not the first time Randall juxtaposes sex and more abstract topics, such as sex and math in 487: Numerical Sex Positions or sex and engineering in 592: Drama","[A flowchart with one starting bubble at the top. Two arrows goes left and right below this bobble to two other bobbles.] Top: ""This seems to be taking longer than usual-""  Left: ""-Try reloading Gmail if the problem persists.""

1732: Earth Temperature Timeline,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1732:_Earth_Temperature_Timeline,internet,"[After setting your car on fire] Listen, your car's temperature has changed before.","This comic is a timeline on how the temperature has changed from 20,000 BCE (Before Common Era) to the present day (2016), with three predictions for the rest of the 21st century depending on what actions are taken (or not taken) to stop CO₂ emission. This comic is a direct, but much more thorough, follow up on the previous global warming comic: 1379: 4.5 Degrees. By having readers scroll through millennia of slow-paced natural changes, Randall uses the comic to confront the the rapid temperature rise in the recent years.   Over the past 100 years, human action has produced a large amount of CO₂ emissions, which have caused a rise in average global temperature through the greenhouse effect. This is called global warming and is part of a climate change, a subject that has become a recurrent subject on xkcd. There are still many people who claim that this is not happening, or at least that it is not caused by any human actions, called climate change deniers. One argument of theirs is that global warming is happening for natural causes, summarized with the phrase ""temperature has changed before"".  This comic shows that while temperature changes have indeed occurred before, the speed of the current temperature rise is much, much faster than those measured for many previous thousands of years. The comic became so popular that Randall postponed the release of his next comic to keep this one on the front page one day longer.   The temperature curve is a dotted line most of the time, but from about 1850 to 2016 the measurement data is good enough to let the curve become a solid line indicating that this is not an estimate. Before 1850 the temperature is an estimate based on the sources given. And likewise into the future the three possible curves are also dotted to show that they are predictions, based on how seriously the population of Earth takes knowledge (and comics) like this.   Although this is a topic Randall obviously takes very seriously, and by far most of the facts fit with known history, he still includes several jokes in the comic. See also the table explaining each item in the comic. So after the election of a climate change denier later in the year of this comic's release, several sad comics has been posted. Some of the reason could be that Randall no longer believes that even his worst fears (as expressed by the current path at the bottom) will hold up, when USA gets a president, who will on purpose act in a way that scientist claims will make the temperature rise even more. See more here.  The title text compares the saying that ""the temperature has changed before"" comparing temperature changes over thousands of years to the rapid global warming over the last century with saying that the ""small"" changes to the temperature a car experiences over the years of normal usage should not make you worried over the rapid temperature increase that happens when someone sets your car on fire. A related joke was used recently in 1693: Oxidation.  The image attributes climate data sources as ""Shakun et al. (2012), Marcott et al. (2013), Annan and Hargreaves (2013), HadCRUT4, IPCC"":  Note there are several spelling errors in the comic, so please do only correct spelling errors that are not part of the comic!

1773: Negativity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1773:_Negativity,internet,[Google search] how do I block my lawn,"Cueball is going outside for some fresh air because he wants to escape the trolls of the Internet, which is known for hosting several hostile and unpleasant ideas and people. However, as he walks, some grass speaks up to insult him, and Cueball is upset to find that he hasn't escaped the negativity at all. (see 1749: Mushrooms which involves an unusual occurrence of a vocalizing angry mushroom).  The title text expands on this, with him searching Google for how to ""block the lawn"". Blocking someone refers to a standard setting on websites and online services that can prevent certain users from communicating with you, but it is as yet unknown how this would work for a lawn insulting you. This is made ironic by the fact he is using the Internet to find an Internet technique (blocking) on a non-Internet object, while at the start of the comic, he just wanted to escape the Internet.  The term ""blocking"" is actually used in lawn-care to refer to techniques where sunlight is restricted from reaching the lower parts of the grass stems and to persuade the root system to grow deeper into the soil.  The negativity Cueball meets on-line is likely due to the results of the recent 2016 United States presidential election and this one was released only three days before the U.S. Electoral College voted for Donald Trump to become the 45th president of the United States, and this was still a bit exciting as there where rumors/hopes that some of the electors would not vote for Trump. (But only two changed away from Trump!) That this is likely is further supported with other recent comics. The first of these 1761: Blame is almost a prequel to this one, as it is about being sad about what happens on-line. This comic here was thus the second sad comics following the election, culminating shortly after his inauguration with a comic simply titled 1790: Sad. (See more on other depressive comic in this trivia.)  Later in 1802: Phone, Cueball cannot go outside for a walk without bringing his phone as he cannot stand to be disconnected from his feed, which is the exact opposite of what he tries in this comic. Although in the title text he does try to disconnect, he then finds that this is also bad because it leads to social isolation.","[Cueball walking on grass] Cueball: It's nice to get outside, away from the pain and negativity of the internet,  [Cueball stops walking] Cueball: And just enjoy the cool breeze and the grass under my feet.

1854: Refresh Types,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1854:_Refresh_Types,internet,"The hardest refresh requires both a Mac keyboard and a Windows keyboard as a security measure, like how missile launch systems require two keys to be turned at once.","In this comic Randall presents five different levels of refresh operations for web applications. The first three (soft refresh, normal refresh, and hard refresh) are common operations to keep the content in the browser retrieved from the server up to date. The other two (harder refresh and hardest refresh) are fictional operations to perform refresh operations on remote resources. The terms are probably adopted from soft and hard reset operations used to restart broken computers or e.g. smartphones.  Soft refresh refers to an operation in a web page, commonly known as Ajax, that requests new information without reloading the entire page. The given example, Gmail, includes a feature that allows users to poll new emails and show it in the inbox interface. It is a command using JavaScript to load new contents from the server in the background and only update necessary components of the page. Since modern web applications do this also automatically in short time intervals those buttons are mostly unnecessary. In Gmail a user will see a new message instantly.  The normal refresh is a browser operation that reloads the complete web page, text and other content that has changed since the original load will be updated. The operation can be triggered by refresh buttons in browsers, though it also can be requested using the common keyboard commands as listed by Randall. Many pages -- like the main page at xkcd.com -- don't have a refresh button. If the page has been opened before a new comic release, pressing F5 afterwards causes reload and the new comic is shown.  What Randall calls hard refresh is a less common browser operation forcing the browser to re-download every part of the webpage, ignoring any cached content. Caching is a common way of decreasing webpage load times. Browsers save resources such as images or CSS stylesheets on the first visit on a webpage and use the local copy on subsequent visits. It allows them to decrease amount of transfer needed to show the webpage, but can prevent showing changes made to the resources (for example a web developer changing the stylesheet). In those cases the hard refresh ensures that each part of the website is downloaded in its newest form.  If there is a Web-Proxy or a Cloud-Cache (like used for this wiki) in between the browser and the Web-Server this type of refreshing may not work. In this case, unless a purge link is available, the user has to wait until the cache entry is expired and a new request to the web server is done. A Web-developer may try to avoid this behavior by including special headers in the HTTP reply to control caching, but not all proxies or clouds follow these instructions.  Harder refresh is a joke that extends the existing naming scheme. The joke is that if a hard refresh resets the browser display and cache, a harder refresh should reset the source of the data by cycling power in the data center. Assuming no damage was done, this would reset the memory on the server, erasing any information that had not been written to disk, and setting the server to the state it was in at launch. This would cause considerable downtime, and would be unlikely to help the user at all.  In orchestrated environment it may indirectly cause some virtual machines in the cloud to be rebooted and assigned to an other web server needing more workload. But a growing workload is caused by hundreds or thousands additional requests and not just a single key combination from one browser. While there are administrative web tools allowing to perform a reboot (physical or virtual server) just by clicking a single button, this is not what is being referred to in the comic. A standard (non-administrative) user rebooting an actual physical server using a common web page is not possible, unless there is a software or operating system bug that will cause exactly this. This would be considered an extremely critical problem and its resolution would be given an extremely high priority by the server owners.  The harder refresh uses six keys, including the non-standard 'HYPER' key, a feature of the Space cadet keyboard. Hyper could also refer to the Linux modifier key Hyper, similar to Control, Alt, and Super.  The fifth option, hardest refresh, moves beyond resetting the source of the data and resets the entire internet back to ARPANET, an early military network which was a forerunner to the modern internet. The implications of this are not made clear, but it should be noted that it wouldn't help to fix any problems a user is experiencing in-browser, as HTTP, the protocol by which web pages are sent, was not developed until late 1990, the year ARPANET was decommissioned.  The hardest refresh shortcut uses fifteen keys, including non-standard ones such as Ø and ⏏. (The former is a key found on Norwegian and Danish keyboards, the latter is the ""eject"" key found on Mac keyboards and some laptops.) The shortcut makes amusing comparisons about a shortcut that includes not only the F5 function key, but also the keys for the letter ""F"" and the digit ""5"", as well as the similarity in appearance between O, 0, and Ø.  The title text suggests that the inclusion of both the Windows key and Command key in the hardest refresh shortcut is a security measure akin to the Two-man rule, as it would require two keyboards to enter. Normally this would not work in practice as the modifier keys are handled per keyboard and not combined across keyboards for most operating systems allowing more than one keyboard.","[A table with three columns is shown.

565: Security Question,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/565:_Security_Question,internet,"Let's invite him to a party and play 'I never'. Okay, I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street. ...he's taking a drink!","Security questions are sensitive questions that allow a user to retrieve or reset his password if the password is lost or stolen. Because of this powerful function, security questions should be treated just as seriously as passwords. Typical security questions include ""What's your mother's maiden name?"" or ""What's your secondary school?"" and are intended to be easy for the user to answer but hard for anyone else to answer.  In this comic, however, the security question is deployed in a strange way, as the question ""Where are the bodies buried?"" assumes that one had buried bodies, hence had killed someone. The question turns out to be a ploy by the police, who were trying to bait Cueball into confessing his crime, as well as revealing the location of the incriminating evidence.  ""I never"" is a drinking game that somebody says ""I never did something"" to the others. If you never did it, you don't need to drink, otherwise, drink. Since he takes a drink for ""I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street"", the police have narrowed down the search area. The next statement in the game could be ""I never hid any bodies WEST of Central Avenue"" (or whatever road dividing the area), further localizing the bodies to a quarter of the original search area, in a Twenty Questions manner. Of course, by taking the drink Cueball also admits that he buried bodies, though this evidence would not likely be accepted by any court.","[Cueball sits at a computer.] Computer Screen: -Email Account Setup- To verify your identity, we need to ask you a question nobody else could answer.

924: 3D Printer,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/924:_3D_Printer,internet,I just can't wait for the Better Homes and Gardens list of helpful tips for household reuse of sixteen-inch acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene phalluses.,"With the ongoing development of 3D printing technology, the cost of low end 3D printers continues to reduce steadily, and the complexity of modelling and producing components is becoming easier. These factors, among others, means that 3D printers are beginning to be found in homes, rather than exclusively in businesses. Ponytail & Cueball are discussing the improvements and expect widespread deployment soon.  Spam emails promoting penis-enlargement products are very common, and often show images of unnaturally large penises to advertise how effective they are. The adverts prevalence and aggressive marketing techniques have made them a well known staple of email inboxes, though the improvement of spam filters has increasingly banished them to the spam folder.  Cueball and Ponytail predict that the spam producers will quickly jump on the opportunity presented by the widespread prevalence of 3D printers, and start advertising their wares with 3D printed phalluses. Usually someone would have to chose to print out a spam email, but it wouldn't be difficult to imagine a scenario where the email contains malicious code which automatically prints them a huge phallus.  In the title text, Better Homes and Gardens is an American magazine that, as the name suggests, shows you how to make your home and garden better often by reusing common household items in new and innovative ways. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (or ABS) is a light-weight and moldable plastic which makes it perfect for 3D printers.","[Two people before a 3D printer, one with a wrench.] Cueball: 3D printers are getting incredible. Ponytail: I think we're not far from widespread deployment.  Ponytail: And you know what that means.  Cueball: Spam containing actual enlarged penises? Ponytail: I give it a week."
970: The Important Field,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/970:_The_Important_Field,internet,"I hear in some places, you need to fill one form of ID to buy a gun, but two to pay for it by check. It's interesting to see who has what incentives to care about what mistakes.","It is very common that online input forms demand that one's email address is typed twice, and also quite common that pasting into the second field is disabled, so that there is no escape. If a form asks for some information that is really much more crucial, and this standard routine thoughtlessly isn't used for those fields too, it would comically seem that the form-makers consider your email address to be hideously important, maybe even more important than the location where a missile is programmed to land. In the comic, the impression is that it is less important that the wrong city is not accidentally wiped out, than that the boss knows who to blame afterwards.  The title text suggests a real world parallel to this. Randall has heard about differing priorities of identifying who is purchasing a firearm (the state/locality requires one form of identification) and ensuring the payment (the store requires two forms of ID, to properly document the person, in case the check is fake or is rejected by the bank). The point is that people often care a lot about money, but a gun in the wrong hands is a potential disaster bigger than a few hundred missing dollars.  This is the only comic so far to feature Green Hat. It appears that the green hat means that he is part of the military.","[Green Hat sitting at a computer.] Computer: Welcome to the missile launch interface! Click Computer: Enter the target's coordinates. Type Type Computer: Enter your email address for our records. Type Type Computer: Enter your email again, to ensure you typed it correctly."
1181: PGP,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1181:_PGP,internet,"If you want to be extra safe, check that there's a big block of jumbled characters at the bottom.","PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a program which can be used to encrypt and/or sign data, including messages sent as emails. Encrypting means encoding data in a way that requires a secret key to decrypt and read; signing means that there is a code included in the data which can be used to verify the identify of the sender and that the data has not been altered in transit.  In the case of the email in this comic, it has only been signed; not encrypted (hence, the top of the first line of text can be seen and is legible in normal English). This is more common than encryption, as reading an encrypted message would require the recipient to already be a PGP user. In fact, the use of PGP even to sign email messages is so rare that most people have probably never seen a signed message. Because a signed email is so rare, and because it is already legible and unencrypted, Randall is making the tongue-in-cheek observation that few users, technical or otherwise, actually know how to use the signature to verify the authenticity of the sender using the PGP signature, and that such users can safely assume that since there is a signature, that is good enough evidence that the message is authentic. Further, because PGP signatures are so rare and probably ignored by most recipients, he suggests one would not expect anyone to even bother creating a false PGP signature; therefore the mere existence of a PGP header would suggest authenticity.  The title text extends the joke by suggesting you confirm there's a bunch of random characters in the footer (this is the actual signature that PGP generates which can be used to verify the authenticity of the email). Again, Randall is humorously suggesting that the existence of the block is itself sure evidence of authenticity.","How to use PGP to verify that an email is authentic: Look for this text at the top [In mail header, light grey.] Reply [Highlighted, with arrow pointing to it from the text ""Look for this text at the top"" above.] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- [In mail message, light grey.] HASH: SHA256 Hey, First of all, thanks for taking care of  [After mail message.] If it's there, the email is probably fine"

Cueball replies that he has one resolution. It's to finish reading and replying to his backlog of emails from 2008, 9 years prior to this comic. He obviously does not read his email when they arrive in his inbox, and he now vows to at least get those e-mails from 9 years ago read.   As he further states in the caption below, he now (finally) begins to doubt his method for replying to e-mails, since his backlog now approaches 10 years. Some would probably say he should have found this out when his backlog approached 10 days, or at least when it reached a month.  A common technique for the productive members of the world is to batch reply to email instead of replying to each one individually as they come. The principle is that setting aside specific times to reply instead of always being ""on call"" gives the messages the attention they deserve while avoiding the urge to constantly check your email when you should be doing important work. Such a technique could be to check and answer all your emails once a day, or once a week, for instance and allocating a specific amount of time like one hour every day to do so. It is unlikely that somebody would wait years to start the task of checking emails, so obviously the time reserved per unit of time is way too short, if even existing. This would create a backlog of emails, that could soon be so large it would take years to catch up to the e-mail you just got right now.  Another technique for productive people is not to answer certain e-mails; if a subject really is important, the sender will send a reminder a few days later. (If he does not, the sender can be presumed to have solved the problem himself, saving lots of time on the receiver's side. Of course then you have to check your e-mails to realize if someone has sent a reminder.) Cueball has possibly used this technique on a friend's request, but became remorseful after nine years.  The title text is a reply to an email in which Rob wished to see the movie WALL-E, a film that came out in 2008, with Cueball during its opening weekend. However, the opening weekend is now far in the past, and yet Cueball doesn't realize it and trails off with ""are you still doing that, or...?"" Mentioning the release of a popular movie and then making it clear that it will soon be ten years ago that the movie came out, feels a lot like a hidden Comic to make one feel old, but it may be stretching it to include this directly in that category. But it is a technique often used by Randall, quite clearly in most of that category, for instance 891: Movie Ages.  A real (and useful[citation needed]) New Year's resolution would involve trying to answer his emails as they arrive (instead of spending any more time on years old emails), which would have avoided the mess he's currently in, and will stop it from getting worse in the future.  In this comic Cueball may represent Randall. He receives so many e-mail due to the xkcd comic that he may have a hard time going through them all. Then there is his what if? email, and possibly many more. Hopefully he has a separate e-mail for friends that wish to send him a request for going to the opening of new recent movie. On the about page on xkcd he does write the following for one of the e-mails he cites as contact:","[Megan and Cueball are walking along.] Megan: Did you have any New Year's Resolutions? Cueball: Gonna finally finish dealing with those emails from 2008.  [Caption below the panel:]  As my email backlog approaches 10 years, I'm starting to have doubts about my approach."
1873: Email Reply,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1873:_Email_Reply,internet,"I would be honored, but I know I don't belong in your network. The person you invited was someone who had not yet inflicted this two-year ordeal upon you. I'm no longer that person.","Cueball is sitting at his desk writing an email. He is responding to Kevin, who sent him an email two years ago. Cueball is so far behind in responding to his email, he goes to great lengths to apologize for it. Instead of blaming the email culture which creates enormous quantities of messages, he blames himself for not keeping up. Failing to answer emails is a common symptom of general anxiety disorder, a problem which can snowball out of control as more and more emails go unread or unanswered.  At this point in the email, the reader assumes that Kevin's message really demanded a faster response, being personal and timely. Then Cueball reveals that the email is just the ubiquitous LinkedIn invitation. LinkedIn is a professional networking site notorious for inundating its users with emails inviting them to connect to other users (frequently people the user has little-to-no connection to), as well as any email contacts of their users whether or not they actually belong to LinkedIn themselves. Thus, an invitation to connect to LinkedIn is most often immediately deleted or ignored. A less socially anxious person who understands the irrelevance of such an email would not worry about failing to respond to such a request at all, and certainly would not pour his heart out in apology for failing to reply.  The title text continues this, suggesting that Cueball feels not even worthy of the original invitation.  One could interpret the letter as a passive-aggressive lashing out, but that does not seem to be in character for Cueball. Had the character worn a Black Hat though...  Cueball's difficulty in checking his email was previously addressed in 1783: Emails (trivia: the comic numbers 1783 and 1873 are anagrammatic).  This is the fourth comic within a year where Randall uses ""Kevin"" as a go-to-name, although it was half a year since last time in 1795: All You Can Eat. See details in that comics trivia.","[Cueball sits at a desk, typing on a laptop. The following message is displayed above him:]  Dear Kevin,  I'm sorry it's taken me two years to reply to your email. I've built up so much stress and anxiety around my email inbox; it's an unhealthy dynamic which is more psychological than technical. I've tried one magical solution after another, and as each one has failed, deep down I've grown more certain that the problem isn't email – it's me.  Regardless, these are my issues, not yours; you're my friend, and I owe you the basic courtesy of a response. I apologize for my neglect, and I hope you haven't been too hurt by my failure to reply.  Anyway, I appreciate your invitation to join your professional network on LinkedIn, but I'm afraid I must decline..."
1915: Nightmare Email Feature,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1915:_Nightmare_Email_Feature,internet,"...just got back and didn't see your message until just now. Sorry! -- TIME THIS MESSAGE SAT HALF-FINISHED IN DRAFTS FOLDER: 3 days, 2 hours, 45 minutes.","Most modern email clients provide tools to help their users read, write and keep track of email efficiently. For instance, the user may receive a notification if the email body contains wording that suggests a file has been attached, but there is no actual attachment, in order to prevent forgetting to include the intended file in the email.  This comic suggests a similar feature, one which would inform not the user, but the recipient of the message, how long the email has been revised before being sent. This is an expansion of a common feature of collaboration tools used by law firms, and modern word processors such as Microsoft Word 2016.  Randall calls this his nightmare email feature, implying he spends too much time in revision of what should be simple email messages and that making himself, or worse - the recipient, aware of the actual time would make him anxious.  In the shown case it seems that the recipient of the shown e-mail had asked to their latest meeting and asks if he want to do it again this weekend. It then took 47 minutes to write a short reply in which he ends up saying he enjoyed the thing referred to. But alas he has no time this weekend. And then let the other suggest a possible time for a dinner... or something. (Of course there could be more to the email above the panel, but it seems to be a very short answer to another e-mail, and it increases the nightmare for the writer (and the impact of the joke) if this was all that was written in 47 minutes).  If the text had been written out in less than 2 minutes, it would not have been a problem. But it seemed the writer of this e-mail had to think a lot about how it was phrased. This could lead the recipient to wonder what took so long. Was it that he did not enjoy it, but ended up writing this to be nice? He only writes he is busy this weekend, thus not giving any reason as to why. And the last part gives him the possibility to also ""be busy"" on whatever time is suggested for dinner. Also whatever is very non committing. All this is also true if it had been written in 2 minutes, but then at least there would not have been time to think a lot about how the reply was phrased.  The title text describes a similar uncomfortable feature, which would inform the recipient how long a message has been sitting in the user's drafts folder, thus highlighting their procrastination as well as demonstrating that ""(...)didn't see your message until just now"" is a lie, or at least it was only true when the original message was written, and now three days later another message should have been written instead.  Randall has explored a related anxiety-inducing feature of instant messaging in 1886: Typing Notifications.","[A panel with a short email message, with the first line partly obscured by the top of the panel.

461: Google Maps,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/461:_Google_Maps,internet,Apparently Google assumes you're traveling during the ferry's normal operating hours. We lost two hours circling that damn lake (to say nothing of the Straw Man).,"Google Maps is a web mapping service application. Before smartphones with GPS mapping software were widespread and most people's printers hadn't yet run out of ink, it was common to print out directions to take with you on a trip. The web version of Google Maps has many features including a route planner. As sophisticated as early versions were, it occasionally gave suboptimal directions. For example, the directions may tell you to take an exit that, in reality, is unmarked. Directions also did not take time of day into account which would help in planning routes to avoid traffic or to make use of services such as a ferry.  The title text tells us that Cueball and his brother attempted to drive around the lake since they could not take the ferry and had an unfortunate run-in with the Straw Man (apparently waking him as the directions warned against).  Though no specific game or movie is referenced, steps 75 to 81 of the directions read like the plot of a horror film, a guide of a video game, or a role playing game. A straw man is another term for scarecrow, a common antagonist in both. Step 80 reads exactly like an old text adventure game's description of an area.  There are additional small jokes in the distance column of the directions:  This might be a reference to Google Maps' many easter eggs.","My road trip with my brother ran into trouble around page three of the Google Maps printout  [Google Maps printout.] ← 70.

489: Going West,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/489:_Going_West,internet,"Listen, they request that you stop submitting a listing for your house labeled 'WHERE YOU BROKE MY HEART'.","Google Maps is a service to let people look at the world through their web browser. When Google Maps was first starting out, the maximum zoom level a person could select went past the highest resolution imagery available in certain areas. When this happened, Google Maps would tile the message ""We're sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level"". When Cueball looks ""closely"" enough into Megan's eyes, he sees this same message.  The title text refers to a functionality of Google Maps that allows users to submit/update information about places on the map, such as business listings, monuments, etc. Such updates must be approved by Google before other users can see them. Apparently, Cueball has been repeatedly submitting 'WHERE YOU BROKE MY HEART' as a listing for his own house, so that Megan, who is now on the Google Maps team, will see those submissions.","[Cueball and Megan are talking, and Cueball is walking away from Megan.

Using the scroll wheel, the user can zoom out to see a larger area. Lena River is a river in Russia, flowing into the Arctic Ocean (with a large delta).  Clicking on the comic leads to an online Google Maps page showing the satellite imagery of the Lena Delta.  It appears that Cueball is simply trying to explore the world without leaving his laptop or purchasing an expensive game.  Alternatively, he may be playing Mapcrunch, this 'game' randomizes a street view location with the goal of finding the airport.   The title text states that he apparently somewhat still treats it as a game and that he has been on it for at least a decade.","[Cueball at a computer.] February 4th: Departed the mouth of the Lena River, heading south.

1204: Detail,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1204:_Detail,internet,"2031: Google defends the swiveling roof-mounted scanning electron microscopes on its Street View cars, saying they 'don't reveal anything that couldn't be seen by any pedestrian scanning your house with an electron microscope.'","Google Earth is a mapping software service provided by Google that allows people to view the Earth from above. If zoomed in to maximum magnification, one can obtain clear views of individual streets and homes.  An image's resolution is the smallest length detectable in that image. In terms of Google Earth, this refers to the real-life distance corresponding to one pixel in an aerial image. Randall points out that the level of detail in Google Earth's images has been increasing exponentially since its introduction, as aerial imaging technology improves and better ways of collecting the data are found. Each tick in the scale represents a resolution improvement by 1000 times.  In quantum mechanics, the Planck length is (in layman's terms) the smallest measurable distance, defined as approximately 1.6×10−35 meters, or around 1020 times smaller than the diameter of a proton. As the graph indicates, this may be called the ""resolution"" of the universe.  Randall extrapolates the exponential trend of Google Earth's increasing resolution, 'revealing' that by the year 2120 or so, Google Earth's resolution will approach and even possibly exceed the Planck length, an obviously fanciful and impossible idea. Current laboratory instruments cannot even get close to measuring the Planck length, barely able to reach the level of the atom. (Which, by the chart's prediction, will be surpassed by Google Earth at around 2040.)  Other comics exploring unwarranted extrapolation include 605: Extrapolating, 1007: Sustainable and 1281: Minifigs.  The title text refers to controversy that Google received at one point regarding their use of vehicle-mounted Street View cameras to take images of streets and houses, and how such photography could constitute an invasion of privacy. Google defended itself by stating that the cameras can see nothing more than a pedestrian walking by. Given the trendline in this comic however, Google would need to produce resolution in the nanometer range by 2031, which (using today's technology) would require the use of scanning electron microscopes. The same 'invasion of privacy' defense would obviously not work here, as 1) current scanning electron microscopes in labs can only be used with small specimens at very close range, and are completely unsuitable for observing something as large as a house or for observations from a passing car, and 2) most pedestrians are not equipped with scanning electron microscopes.

Two trendlines are drawn on the graph; one is labeled ""Earth"" and remains constant at the Planck length over time; the other is labeled ""Google Earth"" and connects the aforementioned three points, extending upward in a straight line and approaching the Planck length around 2100. Both trendlines break up into question marks before the point they would intersect.]"
1803: Location Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1803:_Location_Reviews,internet,"Google and Yelp keep deleting my scathing reviews of the Mariana Trench, the Chernobyl reactor core, the jet stream, and the equator.","Many online advertising services and social media networks (like Google and Yelp, both mentioned in the title text, and for instance Facebook) allow users to leave reviews of stores, businesses and locations. For various reasons these sites often find themselves with pages dedicated to, as Randall puts it, ""places that really don't need reviews"" such as municipal works installations, government property, and natural landmarks. This naturally attracts both clueless people and lots of self-styled comedians leaving less-than-helpful comments on such review pages.   Randall is just poking fun at this phenomenon by inventing possible reviews for the (fictional) location Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility, depicted with a Google Maps-styled map page along with a series of so-called reviews. (There does exist a Canyon River located in Ontario/Canada and one in Washington/USA (the latter is a significant tributary to the Satsop River). Canada does not maintain nuclear weapons since 1984, so the launch site should be located in Washington).   See explanations for the 11 visible (out of 22) reviews in the table below. Of course those responsible for such a facility with nuclear missiles would not like the attention they would be getting in this way, especially not when one of the comments mentions a hole in the fence... Although this comic makes a joke about reviews it has chosen a very dangerous facility to joke about. See more about this under Politics below  In the title text Randall mentions that both Google and Yelp keep deleting his scathing reviews of several locations like the above. The questions is if they would have done it if they had not been so harsh... While Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility appears not to exist, the places/phenomena he lists in the title text certainly do, and are places that you either cannot or would not normally visit as destinations. Here below each ""location"" is explained. That the deletion of such reviews is real has been proven by this comic, as it also happened for those that (of course) posted these reviews on Google maps as a response to this comic.  Mariana Trench is the deepest area of the world's oceans, about 10,994 meters (36,070 ft) deep, located between Japan and Australia. The pressure in the Mariana Trench is about 1,086 bars, more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure of about 1 bar at sea level. Despite this enormous pressure some organisms live in the Mariana Trench. Humans can reach the ground only by special deep-sea submarines, like Jacques Piccard did in 1960 with the Bathyscaphe Trieste. See reviews for the Mariana Trench at Google Maps and Facebook.  The Chernobyl reactor core is the most dangerous part of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It is located in the North of Ukraine. In the reactor No. 4 there was a nuclear disaster that happened on 26 April 1986. It caused devastating damage and massive radioactive contamination. There is still a Chernobyl Exclusion Zone 30 kilometers around the power plant. See reviews for the Chernobyl power plant at Google Maps and Facebook.  Jet streams are a meteorologic phenomenon about 9 to 16 kilometers above the ground. A stream consists of air currents with speeds from 92 km/h (50 kn; 57 mph) to over 398 km/h (215 kn; 247 mph). Such jet streams are routinely used for reducing fuel usage for long distance plane travels. As it is a ribbon rather than a point, it could not have a single point on the map. Also, the jet stream fluctuates north and south; so even if it could be pinpointed, the location would be constantly changing.  The equator is, as with the jet streams, not a singular place but a circumference around the Earth. Reviewing the equator as a singular location is rather pointless, though there is a whole range of specific (and interesting) locations around the equator, with countries with tropical rainforest climate, which many people from European and North American countries struggle with. That said, most of the equator goes over water.  In the table the rating is given with the review. After that an explanation both of the rating and of the review is given. Notice that any or all of the reviews could be sarcastic or ""trolling"", as is fairly typical on the internet, especially for reviews given for such a location as this one. This table assumes all the reviews are played straight.   The decision to make a comic depicting a nuclear missile launch facility may not be entirely random, given Randall's mildly political mood lately. In particular, it could be due to the cold relationship between Russia and the United States at the time of this comics release. Two weeks prior to this comics release Russia Deploys Missile, Violating Treaty and Challenging Trump. This was less than a month after Donald Trump became president. Trump has been positive towards Vladimir Putin earlier, but after the violation USA condemned the new missile. That Randall was not in favor of Trump becoming president was made clear in 1756: I'm With Her. His predecessor Barack Obama even stated, before Trump was elected, that If Trump can't handle Twitter, then he can't handle nuclear codes. Randall has earlier mentioned the codes indirectly in 1242: Scary Names, where he mentions the Nuclear football, which is much more scary than the name... It is a year ago he finished a ""series"" of four comics in a short period about nuclear weapons with 1655: Doomsday Clock (see about the other comics at the bottom of that explanation). But it seems that recent events have made him think about it again, although he tries no to as made evident in 1796: Focus Knob.","[Inside the main panel there is a frame with a Google location map with the typical red pin stuck in the center of the map inside a large gray region of the map.

887: Future Timeline,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/887:_Future_Timeline,internet,"Not shown: the approximately 30,000 identical, vaguely hysterical articles titled ""WHITE PEOPLE IN [THE US/BRITAIN] TO BECOME MINORITY BY [YEAR]!"", which came up for basically any year I put in.","This comic uses the same strategy as comic 715: Numbers, in which Randall uses Google to search for phrases and then charts the results. This one is charted as a timeline, whereas 715 was charted as line graphs. It is a list of things predicted or announced by anyone at any time (the ones you see on Google search using ""by the year..."" or similar statements).  ""2101 - War Was Beginning"" is a reference to the opening narration of video game Zero Wing; the same narration is famous for the internet meme ""All your base are belong to us"". As there are not any other out and out references in the comic, and the rest are actually results that you can find using Randall's methods, ""War Was Beginning"" was probably the only thing he got when he googled 2101 as well.  Certain events in this comic, e.g. ""Social Security stops running surplus"", are repeated multiple times. Also, certain bizarre events, like ""Apocalypse occurs"", or ""Flying cars reach market"", happen before rather plausible things, like ""HTML 5 Finished"". Certain events, like ""Japan is a robot-only country"" or ""Gillette introduces 14-blade razor"" may be related to the recurring theme 605: Extrapolating.  The title text is born of a recurring ""white people panic"" situation; scaremongers will predict white minority in the very near future in order to get the panicked racist people to pay attention to them (without actually using valid or accepted scientific measurements to back up these claims- panicked racist people don't exactly fact-check very much), while level-headed sociologists will usually come up with more distant, if not nonexistent, dates from their extrapolations.  This comic has similar features to 1413: Suddenly Popular, 1093: Forget, and 891: Movie Ages.  The only predictions for this period that came true are that the world population has surpassed 7 billion. Canada formally withdrew from the Kyoto protocol in December 2011, and its emissions in 2012 were 18% above 1990 levels (though its population had grown 26% and its GDP had grown 67% in that period). Sadly, homelessness is still a problem in Massachusetts. The prediction about GNU/Linux operating systems remains false; although Android (which is built on the Linux kernel) is currently the most dominant OS, it is not completely GNU/Linux, which remains an extreme minority on consumer devices. And so far as we're aware, the apocalypse has yet to occur.  New Horizons is to make its closest approach to Pluto in July 2015.[1] It was never intended to land on Pluto.  Android OS' market share was already 84.4% as of the third quarter of 2014, showing that both estimates were overly conservative.[2] Windows Phone continued to have less than 30% of iOS' market share.","THE FUTURE According to Google search results Events for each year determined by the first page of Google search results for the phrases:    ""By <year>""  ""In year""   ""By the year

1256: Questions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1256:_Questions,internet,To whoever typed 'why is arwen dying': GOOD. FUCKING. QUESTION.,"Google, a rather popular internet search engine, has a feature known as autocomplete that guesses at search queries before they are fully typed out. These guesses are generally made based on popular searches by other people. From time to time, a particularly strange or hilarious one may be found, as is evidenced in this comic.  The largest pictured questions are: ""Why are there slaves in the bible"" and ""Why are there ants in my laptop"".  All of the questions in the comic are ""why"" questions, so many of them are predicated on false assumptions, such as ""Why are there pyramids on the moon"". All these questions and many more (33,171 in total) can be found in http://xkcd.com/why.txt.  Regarding the title text: in the Peter Jackson films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Arwen becomes sickly for unspecified reasons as the plot advances, apparently giving Aragorn a more personal reason to fight. The only explanation given is by Elrond, who says ""As Sauron's power grows, her [Arwen's] strength wanes."" This subplot is entirely absent from the original novels.  The tables below have been created so as to split the comic into almost entirely arbitrary blocks, which have then been identified with similarly arbitrary numbers. As a general rule, section numbers work top to bottom, then right to left.  http://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/1l3na7/questions/cbvigrd, answers to all the questions.","[This strip is a rectangular word cloud, titled 'Questions found in Google autocomplete'.

1444: Cloud,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1444:_Cloud,internet,Cloud computing has a ways to go.,"Cueball and Megan are lying outside on the grass and looking up at the clouds. Cueball asks Megan what she thinks a particular cloud looks like, following the common human activity of pareidolia, or spotting apparent patterns where there are none (particularly in clouds).  Rather than responding with her own interpretation, Megan takes a picture of the cloud with her phone, and uses Google's Search by Image feature. In this feature, the user uploads an image rather than providing a keyword to search on, and is presented with suggestions about the subject of the original image. Google's search results reveal that the image Megan uploaded is most probably a photograph of a cloud. While indisputable, this does not address the fanciful dimension of Cueball's original question, and highlights the continuing limitations of artificial intelligence with respect to human imagination.  Google image search works by creating a mathematical model of the shapes and colors in the uploaded image, and matching this against images already in its index. Web page analysis then allows Google to guess at what the image is, based on the content of the pages where the matching images were found. Although apparently unimaginative, even humorously so, Google image search does recognize that the subject of Megan's photograph is a cloud, which is an achievement that has so far eluded programmers. This was the subject of 1425: Tasks.  If the term ""cloud computing"" is taken entirely literally, and purely in the context of this comic, then the title text merely comments that the processing of an image of a cloud for queries is not at an advanced state yet. It is really, however, a pun on cloud computing, which is a trendy term for the modern tendency of providing massive amounts of digital storage and distributed computing power over the Internet. In this context, the term ""cloud"" is a metaphor for the way the details of where or how the storage or processing is done are obscured from the user, as if it all takes place inside a cloud. In 2014, cloud computing as a commonly accessible service really is in its relative infancy, being a 21st-century phenomenon, although the concept goes back decades. Java was originally marketed in the 1990s by Sun Microsystems with the slogan ""the network is the computer"", and the mantra of technologies for distributed computing such as CORBA, EJB and SOAP was ""data first"" and ""the computer is the network"".[1]  In a way, every conceivable sense of the term cloud computing is utilized in Google's image search for Megan's cloud image. Cloud computing is also referenced in 908: The Cloud and 1117: My Sky.  It might be interesting to note that the month before, in September 2014, Google employees had published work on image recognition and pattern-enhancing algorithms. Originally conceived to allow better enlargements of small pictures and the objects contained in them, the process could be tweaked to overemphasize weak structures in pictures, leading to DeepDream images, which literally did start to ""see"" distinct, known structures (mostly dogs) even in random noise. This is rather similar to the pastime of looking for known objects in clouds.  Cueball and Megan are again seen cloudwatching in 1899: Ears.","[Cueball and Megan are lying outside on their backs.] Cueball: What do you think that cloud looks like?

1667: Algorithms,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1667:_Algorithms,internet,"There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control.","An algorithm is a basic set of instructions for performing a task, usually on a computer. This comic lists some algorithms in increasing order of complexity, where complexity may refer to either computational complexity theory (a formal mathematical account of the computational resources – primarily computation time and memory space – required to solve a given problem), or the more informal notion of programming complexity (roughly, a measure of the number and degrees of internal dependencies and interactions within a piece of software).  At the simplest end is left-pad, or adding filler characters on the left end of a string to make it a particular length. In many programming languages, this is one line of code. This is possibly an allusion to a recent incident when NodeJS Package Manager angered a developer in its handling of a trademark claim. The developer unpublished all of his modules from NPM, including a package implementing left-pad. A huge number of programs depended on this third-party library instead of programming it on their own, and they immediately ceased to function.  Quicksort is an efficient and commonly used sorting algorithm.  Git is a version control program, i.e., software that allows multiple people to work on the same files at the same time. When someone finalizes (""commits"") their changes, the version control program needs to join the new content with the existing content. When more than one person has made overlapping changes at the same time, the process of figuring out how to join them is called merging, and the algorithm for it is anything but simple.  A self-driving car is an automobile with sensors and software built into it so that it can maneuver in traffic autonomously, i.e. without a human controller. Various companies have been working on such vehicles for many years now, and while they're further along now than would have been imaginable even a couple of years ago, we're still far away from the dream of hopping in a driver-less taxi and sitting back as the car itself navigates to where we want to be. Recently Randall has made several references to self-driving cars which has become a recurring topic on xkcd.  The Google Search backend is what enables you to type ""what the heck is a leftpad algorithm"" into your browser and have Google return a list of relevant results, including correcting ""leftpad"" to ""left-pad"", truncating ""what the heck is"" to simply ""what is"", and sometimes even summarizing the findings into a box at the top of the results. Behind all that magic is a way to remember what pages the Internet contains, which is just a mind-bogglingly large quantity of data, and an even more mind-numbingly complex set of algorithms for processing that data.  The last item is the punchline: a sprawling Excel spreadsheet built up over 20 years by a church group in Nebraska to coordinate their scheduling. Spreadsheets are a general end-user development programming technique, and therefore people use Excel for all sorts of purposes that have nothing to do with accounting (its original purpose), including one guy who made a role-playing game that runs in Excel; but even that doesn't approach the complexity that develops when multiple people of varying levels of experience use a spreadsheet over many years for the purpose of coordinating the schedule of several coordinated groups.  The scheduling of tasks over a group of resources (a.k.a. the nurse scheduling problem), while respecting the constraints set by each person, is a highly complex problem requiring stochastic or heuristic methods for its resolution. Here, the algorithm would be further complicated by being solved by inexpert users over a spreadsheet model without using engineering practices. The potential hyperbole here is in thinking that such combination of circumstances would produce complexity far over that required to drive a car or sort the public contents of the Internet. While most churches meet mainly on Sunday morning, scheduling of what happens during the service when (especially if there are multiple concurrent services) as well as Sunday School, church business meetings, and congregation-wide events all potentially needing to be scheduled on a particular Sunday morning, the need to find a solution very close to the best possible solution quickly becomes a dire need. Furthermore, with different members involved in a wide variety of activities within and outside of the church, and the classrooms available to the church on Sunday itself, (just scheduling the choir practice times to coordinate with everyone's work schedules is very possibly impossible, especially if two people share the same occupation, and one is the relief for the other,) can indeed be daunting. In addition, there would likely be assorted committee meetings and youth groups during the week.  In the title text, part of the spreadsheet's complexity is described as originating from different versions of the file for different programs. The words used like schism and sect are normally used in context of religions splitting into groups about differences in beliefs. In this case, the split seems to have been not over a theological issue, but about the use of open-source vs. proprietary software, disagreements about which are often compared to religious debates. Most likely, the schism being referred to is the East-West Schism of 1054.  The title text also implies that while trying to reconcile after the schism and to merge the two schedules they reinvented an alternative to Git within the spreadsheet itself, making the algorithms in place at least as complicated as that. Since most spreadsheet programs have a sort algorithm built in, that aspect is implied too, and left-padding could be compared to vamping on an introduction to a hymn. This would indicate that the other milestones of complexity are either included in the current version of the spreadsheet or are planned to be implemented.

The overall impression is of someone technically sophisticated enough to shoot themselves in the foot, and who does not learn any larger lessons despite doing so repeatedly. The title text is another possible entry in this list.  The caption implies that from Randall's perspective, every computer he uses seems to be broken; he doesn't seem to realise this is because he's the one using them, not because the computers actually start off broken.

1200: Authorization,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1200:_Authorization,internet,"Before you say anything, no, I know not to leave my computer sitting out logged in to all my accounts. I have it set up so after a few minutes of inactivity it automatically switches to my brother's.","Computer operating systems were initially written for the business environment. Thus they were made to be accessible to multiple employees, or users, but only fully accessible to administrators (or admins). Regular users can access and use programs on the computer, but only the admin is allowed to make changes to how the computer runs.  This same split level of security continues to this day, even in privately owned, or ""home"", computers.  The joke here is that the most important things on a computer are no longer the programs that it runs, but the private personal data it accesses (usually online). Anyone who wished to do real mischief on an active computer could do considerable damage without ever caring what the admin password was. The admin password, in effect, now guards a vault no one cares about.  This comic pokes fun at the authorization mechanisms surrounding most operating systems' administrator accounts. It makes the argument that the user's data is more valuable than the integrity of the system. This is arguably true for most personal systems, although it is probably not true in a shared-server setup, where a system compromise could lead to the exposure of many users' data.  Essentially, once a user is logged in, he or she can typically access all of his or her data without any further restriction. Modifying the operating system (for example, to install drivers) requires a separate password.  In fact, this password protection also hinders installation of malware, which is otherwise possible even remotely, with the malware then being able to e.g. steal passwords, enabling a hacker anywhere in the world to access your accounts without ever needing to touch your computer. So having your computer set up to not to ask you for an administrator's password arguably implies a bigger risk of identity theft than allowing others to access your system physically while being logged in does.  The title text alludes to the security practice where computers automatically lock the user out after a few minutes, requiring a password from the user in order to continue using it. Instead, Randall's computer automatically switches to his brother's account, presumably compromising his data instead of Randall's.","[Diagram showing several connected rooms. One in the center says ""User account on my laptop,"" surrounded by ""Dropbox,"" ""Photos & files,"" ""Facebook,"" ""Gmail,"" ""PayPal,"" and ""Bank,"" which are connected to the middle room and to each other. Below the middle room is one labeled ""Admin account,"" which is covered in spikes, and has a door to the room above it.] If someone steals my laptop while I'm logged in, they can read my email, take my money, and impersonate me to my friends, but at least they can't install drivers without my permission."
1317: Theft,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1317:_Theft,internet,"Is he ALSO wondering at what point our thoughts diverged, if they even have yet? 'dude, I think he just took your credit card' AM I THE ORIGINAL? HOW DO I TELL?","The term ""identity theft"" refers to a thief acquiring various types of a victim's identification (for example, bank account number and/or Social Security number), thus allowing the thief to pretend to be the victim and commonly steal money from the victim's bank account, etc.  This comic exaggerates the term, interpreting it as the thief literally acquiring the victim's whole personality. Like Cueball & Megan in general, the victim is implied to have some Randallian personality traits, like the love of space and existential angst. Thus, the thief is now completely overwhelmed by having an entirely new personality, not to mention one whose parts clash with each other.  The title text ponders the specifics of the identity acquisition process. Presumably, even two people whose personalities are identical would still start to think different thoughts. (This is a prerequisite for the depiction in the comic; the thief is baffled by his newly acquired interests, while the victim would not be baffled by the thoughts and interests they've developed over their entire life.) It is also wondered whether the victims new doppelganger is wondering the same thing, which could imply that their thoughts have not fully diverged. A friend comments that the victim may be overthinking the situation, and that the thief only took his credit card information. (A common method of identity theft. Does not transfer personality traits[citation needed].) However, the victim is overwhelmed by existential anxiety.","[An identity thief sits in front of a laptop, looking at his hands] Thief: I feel paralyzed by overwhelming existential dread. Thief: ...and yet for some reason I'm really excited about space? [under the panel is text that reads:] The thief who stole my identity has a lot to deal with."
325: A-Minus-Minus,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/325:_A-Minus-Minus,internet,You can do this one in every 30 times and still have 97% positive feedback.,"Black Hat is trying to make the world a weirder place by shipping bobcats to his eBay buyers. Ordinarily, negative feedback is used to warn future buyers about sellers that ship broken products or post misleading listings. In this case, the unfortunate buyer is leaving feedback warning future buyers that Black Hat ships bobcats instead of the actual products, though ""would not buy again"" seems to be a rather feeble response to the replacement. This appears to have been a continuing project, as Cueball receives random packages a year and a half later (576: Packages). Four years later, it is shown that you can blackmail Black Hat into not sending you a bobcat (837: Coupon Code). This comic is also referenced in a popular Amazon review for Randall Munroe's book, What If: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.  Like the weak ""would not buy again"" comment is a play on the stock ""would buy again"" comment often found in positive eBay feedback, the title ""A-Minus-Minus"" is a play on the frequent comment ""A++"".  That in turn, sometimes with varying numbers of pluses, seems to be an easy way people use to pad the end of an eBay comment field to the maximum 80 characters. It's also a reference to jokes in which exceptionally good schoolwork is graded with extra pluses after an A+ (and exceptionally bad work is graded with large numbers of minuses after an F). And finally, it's also a subtle reference to the Futurama episode A Big Piece of Garbage; at one point in that episode, Wernstrom, as an act of petty revenge, gives Farnsworth ""the worst grade imaginable"": an A-minus-MINUS.   The title text is about a flaw in eBay's feedback system: You can intentionally do nasty things to your buyers and get very bad reviews, but still have overall high feedback scores as long as you don't do it too often. (See also 937: TornadoGuard, which shows a different flaw in the concept of averaging reviews—namely that five-star reviews for aesthetic qualities are weighted equally to one-star reviews for major functional deficits—and 1098: Star Ratings, which addresses the topic as well.) These reviews would be disregarded by future customers as well for their weirdness.",[Black Hat is packing a bobcat into a box; Megan stands beside him.]  Megan: What are you doing?

937: TornadoGuard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/937:_TornadoGuard,internet,The bug report was marked 'could not reproduce'.,"This is a comic with a take on an application store - the most common app stores are for iPhones and Android devices. App stores take all the reviews and average the ratings for the overall star rating.   In this comic, we see why this is sometimes a bad idea, especially with something as important as an app called TornadoGuard that should warn the user if a tornado is approaching. In this case, there are three 5 star reviews about the stability and user interface features of the app, left by users who actually never experienced its core functionality (simply because they never used it in a place where a tornado appeared since they got it); however, the only review related to whether the app really works is given the same weight as the others, and sadly for that user the TornadoGuard app failed in alerting the user to an upcoming tornado. Tornadoes are a recurring subject on xkcd. Also see future comic 1098: Star Ratings and 1754: Tornado Safety Tips.   The title text is a call back to 583: CNR. It is a note from the developer's bug report, which said they could not reproduce the error. Of course, they could only reproduce such a failure if there were a tornado coming towards their area. This is a fairly rare situation, especially in certain areas of the world. This lack of suitable testing conditions explains why the actual tornado-prediction portion of their code appears to be faulty.","[The comic is a single panel which resembles a reviews page for a mobile phone application.

958: Hotels,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/958:_Hotels,internet,"Rating: 1/5. Room filled to brim with semen, and when front desk clerk opened mouth to talk, bedbugs poured out.'","In this comic, Black Hat is putting bad reviews on all the hotels he has stayed at and likes and wants to stay in again, in order to lower demand for said hotel. He is simultaneously putting good reviews on bad hotels to steer other people there so there are more vacancies at good hotels. He claims he is not enough influence to put the good hotels out of business.  The Tragedy of the commons ""is a dilemma arising from the situation in which multiple individuals, acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen."" This situation is not a complete example of this concept as Black Hat is the only one doing it. He understands, however, that if others do it, it would apply. (Another example is what would happen using a certain strategy in the game Oregon Trail)  In the last frame, Black Hat references the invisible hand which is the term economists use to describe the self-regulating nature of the marketplace. Black Hat appears to be taking advantage of this invisible hand by cutting it with a knife and eating it.  The title text is an example of Black Hat's negative review, which in itself is a surrealist joke about the hotel. A very believable set of complaints about an awful hotel is that the ""Room filled to brim with bedbugs, and when front desk clerk opened mouth to talk, semen poured out"". However instead, the objects of focus are reversed, creating a ridiculous scenario for the reader to enjoy.","[Cueball is sitting at a desk with a laptop, looking at a review website] Cueball: What's with this negative review? You liked that hotel. Black Hat: I have a script that posts a bad review for every hotel I stay at. It reduces demand, which means more vacancies and lower prices next time.  Cueball: What if the place sucks? Black Hat: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.  Cueball: You punish companies you like! Black Hat: The odds of my review putting a hotel out of business are negligible. Cueball: If we all did that the system would collapse! Black Hat: Doesn't affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.  Cueball: That's not even the tragedy of the commons anymore. That's the tragedy of you're a dick. Black Hat: If you're quick with a knife, you'll find that the invisible hand is made of delicious invisible meat."
1036: Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1036:_Reviews,internet,"I plugged in this lamp and my dog went rigid, spoke a sentence of perfect Akkadian, and then was hurled sideways through the picture window. Even worse, it's one of those lamps where the switch is on the cord.","Cueball and Megan are shown shopping for lamps. In the first part of the comic (only first frame) it is at a time before online reviews could be looked up on a smartphone. They spot a lamp they like, check the price and agree to buy, end of story.  But the rest of the comic shows how difficult shopping has become after reviews have become easily accessible on smartphones while standing in the store. And now this takes up the final three panels, with the result that no lamps have been acquired and they decide to sit in the dark, using the claim that their living room looks fine in the dark to avoid buying a very expensive lamp which is the only one with perfect reviews (like 100% with 5 stars out of 5).   When shopping for anything via reviews, whether it be electronics or even something as simple as lamps like the comic demonstrates, one negative review can spoil a lot of positive reviews. That hits home even more if the review is specific, because humans attach more weight to anecdotes and specific stories. This comic points out the absurdity of paying attention to those reviews, by making the negative review itself absurd (a lamp making your cats go deaf and interfering with your taste buds would imply, at the very least, anomalous radiation, and would not be on store shelves long before some kind of serious recall).   The second part of the comic starts out normal. For the lamp Cueball think is pretty Megan finds lots of negative reviews which implies the product really isn't good after all, and it was even that specific brand of lamps in general that was to be avoided. But then the proceeds to get more and more absurd all the way to the title text. Cueball is for instance looking at  a lamp who someone thinks looks like a uterus. As normal people do not really know how a uterus looks like, and if Cueball did not find this so himself, he should ignore one persons comment. On the other hand reading such a statement will maybe make you think of a uterus every time you see the lamp. So now it may be best not to buy it, but had he not read the comment it might have been a fine lamp for him.  In the final frame Cueball has found a Swiss lampmaker with perfect reviews, but her lamps are very expensive, the most cheap are staring at 1,300 francs. Swiss francs are the units of currency used in Switzerland. In 2012 when the comic was released a Swiss franc was a little more worth than one dollar (1.1$ to a Swiss Franc) making the cheapest lamp go for not much less than US$1450. For comparison, US$15 can get one a decent lamp at IKEA. Furthermore the lampmaker lives in the Swiss Alps and can only be reached via a ski lift. This either indicated that transportation will be very expensive on top of the high starting price or it may even indicate that they will have to go to the lampmaker personally to either acquire a lamp or maybe just to check out that they really do not look like a uterus or other parts of the human reproductive system...  In the title text, the language spoken by the dog, Akkadian, is an extinct Semitic language that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia.  Even if the dog actually did speak a sentence of perfect Akkadian, the chance that the owner would be able to recognize it as such is negligible. But apart from that the dog first went rigid and after delivering the line it was hurled out the picture window. The final joke it that the worst part of this lamp, was not the above mentioned crazy effects on the dog, but that the lamp had, completely normally, the switch on the cord, as opposed to having it on the body of the lamp. A production argument about where to place such a switch, leading to someone getting fired, was part of the joke in 1741: Work.","[Cueball and Megan stand in a store looking at a lamp that Cueball points at on a table in front of them. There is another table behind them with another lamp and next to it stands a box with a picture of yet a different type of lamp in the bottom right corner.

Megan: And affordable. Cueball: Let's get it. Megan OK!   [Exactly the same setting as above except now Megan holds up her smartphone in one hand looking down at it while typing on it with the other hand. Above them (and their spoken text) is a frame with a caption:] Shopping now: Cueball: This lamp is pretty. Megan: It's got 1½ stars on Amazon. Reviews all say to avoid that brand.

There are no lamps next to her.] Cueball: This one has good reviews. Megan: Wait, one guy says when he plugged it in, he got a metallic taste in his mouth and his cats went deaf. Cueball: Eek.  Cueball: What about- ...no, review points out it resembles a uterus.  [Cueball is holding hos smartphone up in front of his face, Megan, looking at him, is holding her smartphone but has her arms down.

1098: Star Ratings,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1098:_Star_Ratings,internet,"I got lost and wandered into the world's creepiest cemetery, where the headstones just had names and star ratings. Freaked me out. When I got home I tried to leave the cemetery a bad review on Yelp, but as my hand hovered over the 'one star' button I felt this distant chill...","This comic deals with the idea that user-generated online star ratings are usually heavily biased towards the best possible rating (five stars).  Because we instinctively read a rating of five stars as five points, a three star rating (3/5) seems like a good rating. However, as the lowest possible rating is typically one star, and not zero stars, a 3/5 is the median, and is equivalent to 10/20 - not a great rating.   Furthermore, since ratings are more likely to be given by people who fall onto one of the extremes (either loved or hated the product), there is a tendency for ratings to be skewed either high or low. Fake reviews are also a factor that often push an aggregate score higher, although this is not addressed in the comic.  For these reasons, Randall suggests a way to read these ratings, which is to consider the four star rating the median value (""OK""), and everything below as a ""crap"" rating.  See also: 937: TornadoGuard, another comic about star ratings.  No product is so perfect that every user will give it five stars. So the only explanation for a five star rating is that only a few users have voted, maybe only one.  The title text may refer to the folkloric practice of attributing a feeling of a chill to someone walking on your future grave. When Randall is back home he would like to give a bad rating on Yelp — a corporation that operates an ""online urban guide"" — and hovering his hand over the 'one star' button, he was just 'walking' over the rating on his own future grave.  Another possible explanation for the title text is that the headstones are from people that gave the cemetery low-star ratings and were then murdered, having their given ratings displayed in the headstones. This in turn would explain the chill Randall feels before clicking the one-star button.",Understanding online star ratings:  5 stars: [Has only one review] 4.5 stars: Excellent 4 stars: OK 3.5-1 star: Crap.
1869: Positive and Negative Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1869:_Positive_and_Negative_Reviews,internet,"This restaurant is great! I was feeling really sick, but then I ate there and felt better!","The comic shows customer reviews from people who purchased a made-up sports drink multi-pack containing twelve 20 oz (591 mL) bottles. The people who gave negative reviews are Merlin (the wizard from the legends of King Arthur) and B. Button (from the short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and its film adaptation). Merlin remembers the future; in the T. H. White novel series The Once and Future King, he was born at the wrong end of time and has to live backwards. Benjamin Button was born with the physical appearance of an old man and grows younger as time progresses. In this comic, they apparently perceive time backwards: Merlin was thirsty then he drank the SmartQuench 9000, but he perceived it as drinking and then becoming thirsty. Benjamin Button was dehydrated then drank 3 bottles and got better, but perceived it the other way around.  Particles of matter can have a positive or negative electric charge. Particles have associated antiparticles with opposite charge. For example electrons are negatively charged particles and their antiparticles are positrons, which are positively charged. Antiparticles can be interpreted as if they were the associated particle moving backward in time. Applying that interpretation to customer reviews gives the caption of the comic: positive reviews from people traveling backward in time are negative reviews (the ""antiparticles"" of positive reviews).  The caption seems to say that there are only positive experiences—some going forward, some backward in life. However, Randall gives an example in the title text of a positive review which is actually about a negative experience by a person traveling backward in time (the person ate at a restaurant then got sick). The conclusion is that there are both positive and negative events, but the way they are perceived depends on both the event and whether one sees it going forward or backward in time.","[A picture with four small bottles and a larger one is shown.

146: Join Myspace,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/146:_Join_Myspace,internet,I really shouldn't abuse that power so heavily.,"This comic refers to the 1980s TV-comicseries (and Greeting Card subjects) ""Care Bears,"" in which various cuddly bears in rainbow colors go on missions to save the world. The characters' ultimate weapon is the ""Care Bear Stare,"" in which the Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer that could bring care and joy into the target's heart.  ""Myspace"" is the social networking site myspace.com. Cueball is convincing Black Hat to create an account at this networking site, but Black Hat isn't interested. Then, when Black Hat gets annoyed by Cueball's persuasions, he activates his ""carebearstare,"" thus overthrowing Cueball's request to be friends only.  One possible explanation for Black Hat's odd choice of weaponry is that he is mocking Cueball. The phrase ""Please? I'll friend you"" sounds like an average preschooler's coaxing (along the lines of ""Please? I'll be your friend!""). Therefore, Black Hat may feel that Cueball's remarks seem childish and deserve a childish backlash.  On a nostalgic note, considering the state of social media in the 2010s, Black Hat is just really good at foreshadowing.  In the title text, Black Hat reflects that he uses his carebearstare power too much, possibly as a form of apology to Cueball.","[Cueball is talking to Black Hat.] Cueball: Dude, you should get on MySpace.

239: Blagofaire,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/239:_Blagofaire,internet,Things were better before the Structuring and the Levels.,"Facts become distorted as time moves forward. What do we know about the Elizabethan times? They spoke strange English. What will 400 years from now think of the first twenty years of the Internet? Crazy people said crazy things online. Will we even say ""online"" 400 years from now? Won't the internet be everywhere, and everyone on it all the time in their retinal implants that being ""offline"" will seem absurd?  Particular facts that this reinactor seems to have confused are:  ""Ren Faire"" is short for ""Renaissance Faire"", described as ""an outdoor weekend gathering, usually held in the United States, open to the public and typically commercial in nature, which emulates a historic period for the amusement of its guests.""   While Cory Doctorow is not in this comic, the character is cosplaying him. This comic inspired several xkcd readers to give Cory Doctorow a red cape and goggles when he won the 2007 EFF Pioneer Award. Cory Doctorow's balloon is featured in 482: Height.  The title Blagofaire might be an amalgamation between Blogosphere, Medieval Faire, and Blag, Randall's way of referencing his blog.  The title text is probably the future cosplayer referring to the state of the future internet, indicating some organizational structure that constrains and stratifies it, and his preference for what he perceives as the wild and unfettered internet of the past.  The ""festival"" the cosplayer references is most likely a reference to the blogger reenactment festivals mentioned in 771: Period Speech.","Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Hey, it worked!

300: Facebook,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/300:_Facebook,internet,"Here, I'll put my number in your cell pho -- wait, why is it already here?'","This comic approaches how Social networks have changed the ways of human interaction. With everyone placing their personal interests on their Facebook profile pages, it has become fairly easy to gather a lot of information about people. In the comic, Cueball uses this information to his advantage: He ascertained Megan's musical preferences beforehand in order to create the illusion of their sharing mutual interests. Megan is led to believe that he is like-minded, thus making it easier for Cueball to persuade her into having sex with him. Here the comic takes at the fact that many people use Facebook as a hunting ground for sexual contacts.  Apparently, Megan did not only mention her favorite bands in her profile, but also her preferred sex position. This can be read as a sideswipe at what intimate details some people are willing to share on the internet. Although mentioning sexual preferences is hyperbolic here.  Megan's taste in both fields can be regarded as outside the mainstream.  Regina Spektor and The Polyphonic Spree are representatives of the indie pop genre. The Wheelbarrow (NSFW) features the man standing behind the woman and holding her legs, while she props up in a wheelbarrow-like position. The retrograde variant has the woman facing upwards. Unusual sex positions are also mentioned in comics 414: Mistranslations and 487: Numerical Sex Positions.  The title text suggests that Cueball did not stop at reading Megan's interests on her Facebook profile, but also obtained her phone number and placed it in his phone. It is implied that some of the ""mildly sleazy"" uses of Facebook can border on the verge of stalking. When Megan discovers the number, she may realise this and stay clear of Cueball...","Mildly sleazy uses of Facebook, part 14: Looking up someone's profile before introducing yourself so you know which of your favorite bands to mention Cueball: Favorite bands?

In olden days you might fancy a girl, and then ask her father if you might court her, and if he granted his permission you would be a couple. Today, that kind of structure and formality is terrifyingly antiquated; as a result we don't have any of the straightforward cues.  This comic suggests that ""making it Facebook official"", which means asserting the existence of a romantic relationship on Facebook by setting one's status to ""In a relationship"", has recently become a way to define when you are a couple. Cueball would like to do it, probably after having sex for the first time with his love interest, to get confidence in his relationship and/or show it off to his friends. Because his love interest isn't so sure about that relationship, or doesn't like to formalize it and prefers to enjoy without thinking too much about it, he suggests a compromise: using the ""It's complicated"" status instead. And he does so with a phrasing very reminiscent of a formal way to propose to marry someone (""Will you be my wife?"").  The title text takes it a step further, suggesting that Facebook has become the only reliable way to know about relationships — even so, without access to Facebook, relationships can't evolve.","[Cueball and Megan in bed.] Cueball: So is this it? Are we a couple now?  Megan: I just don't know. I like this. I just... don't know.  [Silence.]  Cueball: Well will you be my ""it's complicated"" on Facebook?"
574: Swine Flu,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/574:_Swine_Flu,internet,"Bad flu epidemics can hit young adults hardest because they provoke their powerful immune systems into overreaction, so to stay healthy spend the next few weeks drunk and sleep-deprived to keep yours suppressed.","Swine flu is a strain of the flu which can be transmitted from pigs to humans. In 2009, it was the origin of the Pandemic H1N1/09 virus, which most news stations called either ""H1N1"" (the subtype name) or ""swine flu"". Because of the ambiguous name given to it and the somewhat hazy description of the transmittal process and dangers to humans, many people were concerned about the virus in ways that weren't going to be threats. This comic pokes a bit of fun at the overreaction by users on Twitter.  Randall (or someone else) seems to have created Twitter accounts for all referenced handles (that may not have already existed). Some of the handles continue their interactions with each other in later tweets.  Skeeve37 is a self-described hypochondriac. The tweet exemplifies the general populace's over-concern with the ""animal themed"" pandemics. Similarly after the bird flu scare, people avoided eating chicken.  Hanneloreec is a self-described ""young lady who is concerned about many things"". She is a reoccurring character in the webcomic Questionable Content by Jeph Jacques, who also manages her twitter handle.  Paulyshorefan's tweet is a reference to the flash game ""Pandemic 2"", in which players try to create a disease that infects the whole world. Madagascar is the most difficult country to infect, as it only has 1 port and often closes it at the slightest hint of an infection. The difficulty of infecting Madagascar has caused it to become a meme.  CrackMonkey74's tweet is a parody of viral Christian(?) messages that say that current tragedies are God's punishment, despite the fact that the Bible says that the end is not yet to come. More specifically, Crackmonkey74 blames the ACLU, lesbians (a reference to the current culture wars that give big press towards proponents of same-sex marriage against fundamentalist Christians), 9/11 (the day when the Twin Towers fell, causing controversy on whether Muslim terrorists crashed their planes on the towers or whether the government staged this by purposefully demolishing the towers) and nanobots (possibly a reference towards the highly promising but still relatively not understood field of nanotechnology, plus another reference towards the phrase ""playing God"").  Twilight7531's tweet implies that she got a bone fracture which ended up protruding from her arm. However, she seems to lack medical knowledge (or intelligence in general, given that her name carries both something that may be a reference toward the infamous Twilight books and a ""gimmicky"" naming scheme (7531 has the numerals of every odd number that is less than 9)), so she is worried that her fracture is actually swine flu (though how she can be typing with a broken arm is confusing).  Wigu's tweet is a reply towards Untoward's. Given the context, Untoward seems to have ""gotten intimate"" with a pig (since syphilis is a venereal disease). Given the fact that Untoward got sick because of a pig, Untoward seems to have concluded that he got swine flu.  The last comment by 2011Seniorsrule references a medical paper published by the journal The Lancet, in which it is proposed that autism is caused by vaccination. Since then, the paper was partially retracted in 2004, and fully retracted in 2010 because of conflicts of interest. The entire incident has been defined as the MMR vaccine controversy. This stance has still been seen since the retraction of the paper, and still holds some popularity. The most famous figure in support of it is Jenny McCarthy.  Also, fear of germs is common among autistic people, so ""licking an autistic kid"" would be a difficult and possibly painful experience.   The title text refers to the common notion that young adults are hard-drinking individuals who get little sleep.

655: Climbing,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/655:_Climbing,internet,Where did you even get this wall? Return it there and stand it back up right now.,"This comic makes fun of a certain type of images very common on the internet. Those pictures are taken with a camera turned by 90° or rotated later by software, thus creating the illusion of people walking on walls or ceilings. While the original pictures depict the physical impossibility of a rotated gravitational force, Cueball uses the aforementioned technique to create pictures of himself on a climbing wall. Megan approaches him from above the wall, indicating that the climbing wall is in fact lying on the floor. It becomes clear that Cueball was not able to climb a real wall and therefore crawled on the floor with his camera adjusted accordingly.  Her comment is a sideswipe on the practise of self-display on Facebook, which is often done with the help of image manipulation.  The title text implies that Cueball has in fact stolen a real climbing wall, and that Megan wants him to return it.","[Cueball seen from his back, as he is ascending a gray climbing wall with 16 white handles in different shapes and sizes. He is standing on one near the bottom left of the panel with his left foot, holding on to a large handle to the left of his head, and one to the right at shoulder height. His right foot is seeking hold on another handle above knee hight of his left leg.]  [Cueball is seen in profile still climbing up the gray wall, which is drawn in the right part of the panel, 13 handles protruding. At the top of the panel something is protruding from the wall at more than ninety degree angle to the wall, as the line soon goes off panel at the top, but it seems to be directed at a small white half circle at the top of the panel. The line begins in front of the last of the handles at the top, a small one, and below this there is a larger handle bending up making it easy to hold on to. Cueball is holding on with his hands to two similar ""easy"" handles.]  [Cueball climbs a bit further up till his hand reaches the up bending handle in front of the line, and his lower leg and upper knee touches the two handles his hands where on before. Here he has stopped climbing and lifts his head back to look up and sees Megan standing there above him (as she was also doing at the top of the previous panel, but cut of at leg and face). She just stands perpendicular to the wall facing down towards Cueball. he panel has paned up following Cueball so there are only 11 handles now, two more visible ""above"" Megan, and four from the previous panel are now below this panels frame.]  [Same scene but Cueball is now looking at the wall as Megan speaks.] Megan: Your Facebook rock climbing pictures just got a lot less impressive."
723: Seismic Waves,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/723:_Seismic_Waves,internet,The USGS operates a really neat email/SMS earthquake notification service (earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/) that allows fine-grained control of notifications.,"One stereotype surrounding Twitter users is that they are more concerned with broadcasting their current status than they are with addressing it. Earthquakes are natural disasters caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, known for the destruction that they leave in their wake. The comic outlines the potential that technology can have in warning people about earthquakes, which is unfortunately negated by the tendency of the typical users of the technology to care more about sharing the warning message than they are to preserve their own lives.  The title text is a geology pun, as ""fine-grained"" is a common term used by geologists to describe rocks.  Real scientists are trying to turn this speed difference into a practical tool. Go figure.","When an earthquake hits, people flood the internet with posts about it-some within 20 or 30 seconds. [A room with a desk, chair, and computer are shaking. The person in it is on his phone, using Twitter.] RobM163 Huge earthquake here!  Damaging seismic waves travel at 3-5km/s. Fiber signals move at ~200,000km/s. (minus network lag)  This means when the seismic waves are about 100km out, they begin to be overtaken by the waves of posts ABOUT them. [There is a geographical border on a map; the front edge of the wave of the quake is shown, with the front edge of the wave of tweets surpassing it.]  People outside this radius may get word of the quake via Twitter, IRC, or SMS BEFORE the shaking hits. [Megan and Cueball are standing, holding cell phones. Megan is looking at hers.] Megan: Whoa! Earthquake!  Sadly, a Twitterer's first instinct is not to find shelter. Megan and Cueball (on phones): RT @RobM163 Huge earthquake here!"
743: Infrastructures,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/743:_Infrastructures,internet,"The heartfelt tune it plays is CC licensed, and you can get it from my seed on JoinDiaspora.net whenever that project gets going.","Cueball has sent an essay to a friend. While the essay itself was good, his friend was worried because the essay was in the .doc format, the proprietary format that old versions of Microsoft Word used. The friend advises Cueball to use a format based on an open standard,  possibly a format like ODF, ODT, ODS, ODP, or OpenOffice XML.   Cueball, who does not appreciate his friend's contradicting him, argued that the friend is making petty fights about the details of software instead of simply bothering that the software works (which is, in essence, a primordial purpose of software). Given that it can be a challenge to move from a familiar proprietary application to an open-source rival which may lack compatibility, features, support and popularity, Cueball has *some* justification for his stance.  The bearded fellow brings up that he is just concerned about the current proprietary software infrastructure that forces users to use software in a specific way, penalizing them for sharing the software or even preventing looking at the source code in order to learn what the program actually does or how it works. Cueball makes a retort that his friend has an arrogance that crowds out his perspective while claiming that he is autistic. However, it is highly unlikely that Cueball truly believes his friend is autistic. Instead, it's much more likely that he's comparing his friend's behavior to that of people with autism(such as his intense fixation on things that seem trivially important to others), similar to the banter used on online forums and imageboards such as 4chan's /g/ board.   Seven years later, Cueball runs to the friend, alarmed about Facebook's heavy policies about its complete control about the information its users submit. Since Facebook is like Microsoft in its lack of transparency about their services and taking away a lot of control from the user, the fellow retorts with playing ""the world's tiniest open-source violin.""   This is dubious since ""playing the world's smallest violin"" is a sarcastic expression that denotes that the speaker will not give pity to the recipient.  In response to this comic, a 3D model for a tiny violin was released as open source files.  The title text references the following pieces of infrastructure that are compatible with the ""free software"" ideology:  The problem with the lack of open source and Facebook is also the subject of 1390: Research Ethics.","2003: [Cueball approaches a bearded fellow.] Cueball: Did you get my essay? Bearded Fellow: Yeah, it was good! But it was a .doc; You should really use a more open- Cueball: Give it a rest already. Maybe we just want to live our lives and use software that works, not get wrapped up in your stupid nerd turf wars.  Bearded Fellow: I just want people to care about the infrastructures we're building and who- Cueball: No, you just want to feel smugly superior. You have no sense of perspective and are probably autistic.  2010: Cueball: Oh my God! We handed control of our social world to Facebook and they're DOING EVIL STUFF!  Bearded Fellow: Do you see this?  [Inset, the bearded fellow rubs his index and middle fingers against his thumb.] Bearded Fellow: It's the world's tiniest open-source violin."
792: Password Reuse,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/792:_Password_Reuse,internet,It'll be hilarious the first few times this happens.,"This comic has three layers: hacking, philosophy, and Google-satire.  It starts off on a practical level, with Black Hat describing to Cueball a devious social engineering scheme. It relies on the fact that people commonly reuse the same password on multiple websites, and tend to create accounts on new websites somewhat indiscriminately. Thus, one could create a simple Web service to collect users' usernames, email addresses, and passwords. Since many users will reuse this combination on other websites as well, the website owner can try to hack their accounts on other common sites, such as Amazon, PayPal or even people's banks, using the same login information.  In panel 7, the comic suddenly develops a philosophical and ethical bent. Black Hat reveals that he has already carried out step 1, through his numerous unprofitable Web services which he had been running for this very purpose. However, after successfully executing the hack, he realizes that he does not know what to do with all this power.  He reveals that he is already financially self-sufficient, and makes a point that money can't buy happiness once past that point, he even states that research has proven this. He could use his power to realize his sadistic pleasures of messing with people, but he's already a serial classhole and does not need this information to continue that trend.   If he had any beliefs or ideology, he could use this power to try to spread them. However, he reveals that ""since March of 1997"" he doesn't really believe in anything. This could possibly refer to the March 26, 1997 incident in San Diego, California, where 39 Heaven's Gate cultists committed mass suicide at their compound. It is a plausible explanation, since one of them was the brother of Nichelle Nichols (a Star Trek actress), so the event got a big resonance in nerd circles (and Randall often refers to Star Trek in xkcd). It's also possible that Black Hat was a sincere member of the cult, but the religion disbanded after the suicides, or that he orchestrated the cult. However, given Black Hat's strange behavior, it could be anything, even Bill Clinton banning federal funding for human cloning research. Maybe he will finally find a belief he wish to spread after his revelation in 1717: Pyramid Honey. This lack of a belief could also be a reference to the Phoenix Lights. While this event caused since to believe in extraterrestrials, it is possible that Black Hat's contrary nature is so ingrained into his personality that the event caused him to stop having beliefs or opinions of any kind.  The dilemma: Black Hat has cleverly executed a hack that has given him a lot of power, but he doesn't know what to do with it.   The last part of the comic now transitions to a satire on how Google has already gone through both the stages described above. It describes how all of Google's free services are simply a ploy to collect and control all the world's information, similar in concept but grander than the hack described in part 1. It satirizes the notion that behind Google's ""Don't be evil"" motto is actually an end-goal of using their powers eventually for evil.   However, just like Black Hat, once Google reaches the stage where they are able to capitalize on their powers, the Cueball-like head-executive finds that there is nothing evil left for them to desire, except (as Hairbun states) make even more money. As they already make a lot of money this ploy is moot, and anything remaining that they wish to do, such as hosting Call of Duty (CoD) tournaments, isn't evil at all.   In the end the secretary calls dibs on the TV in the lobby in order to play CoD4 on what (one can assume) is a large screen. The Cueball-like executive who wished to implement the evil plan in the first place facepalms when he realizes that Google just sucks at being evil.  In the title text, “The first few times this happens” may refer to the weekly CoD4 “tournament.” Alternatively, it could also mean the “first few times” a company decides to turn evil (but then has no idea how).  This comic was directly referenced in the title text of 1286: Encryptic.","[Black Hat is standing to the left behind Cueball, who is sitting in an office chair at his desk working on his computer. A message from the computer is indicated with a zigzag line from the screen.] Black Hat: Password entropy is rarely relevant. The real modern danger is password reuse. Cueball: How so? Computer: Password too weak  [Zoom in on Black Hat's upper part as he holds a hand up with the palm up.] Black Hat: Set up a Web service to do something simple, like image hosting or tweet syndication, so a few million people set up free accounts.  [Zoom out to Black Hat standing in front of Cueball who has turned in the chair facing Black Hat, the desk is not shown in the panel.] Black Hat: Bam, you've got a few million emails, default usernames, and passwords.  [Only Black Hat is shown as he holds out his arms.] Black Hat: Tons of people use one password, strong or not, for most accounts.  [The next panel is only half the height of the other panels. Above the panel is the text that Black Hat narrates.

On the paper there is three labeled columns, and below each of them about 18 lines of unreadable sentences (mostly just one word). The @ in the e-mail addresses may be indicated with a larger unreadable sign. To the right a broad line goes right from the paper and splits up in five lines that goes up or down ending in five arrows to the right pointing at five labels.] Black Hat (narrating): Use the list and some proxies to try automated logins to the 20 or 30 most popular sites, plus banks and PayPal and such.

Cueball: And then what?  [Same setting in a larger panel with more white space to the left, Cueball has his hand down again.] Black Hat: Well, that's where I got stuck. Cueball: You did this? Black Hat: Why do you think I hosted so many unprofitable web services?  [Zoom in on Black Hat's head now turned towards left.] Black Hat: I could probably net in a lot of money, one way or another, if I did things carefully. But research shows more money doesn't make people happier, once they make enough to avoid day-to-day financial stress.  [Zooming a bit out, but still only showing Black Hat's head in the bottom right corner, again facing right.] Black Hat: I could mess with people endlessly, but I do that already. I could get a political or religious idea out to most of the world, but since March of 1997 I don't really believe in anything.  [This panel is the last in this row, but it does not reach the end of the row above, an indication that this do not directly belong to the panels below. Same setting as panel 3 but Black Hat has his arms out.] Black Hat: So, here I sit, a puppetmaster who wants nothing from his puppets. Black Hat: It's the same problem Google has. Cueball: Oh?  [This panel is the first in the last row. It does not begin to the left, but has been shifted a bit to the right, just as the last panel above tot he right, ended before reaching the right edge of the row above (and this one below).

918: Google+,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/918:_Google%2B,internet,"On one hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch. On the other hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch!","At the time of the comic's release, Google+ was a new social network announced by Google on June 28, 2011. When it launched there were many tech articles written about G+, which appears to look and/or function similarly to Facebook. In the first panel, Megan describes G+ as 'not Facebook'. Facebook is a popular social networking site. She then describes G+ as being like Facebook.  After Cueball thinks about it in the second frame, he comes to a realization in the third frame that a social network like Facebook, but not related to Facebook is all he really wanted. This is in reference to the backlash that happens every so often wherein people grow tired of Facebook, its arcane policies, its cavalier attitude toward user privacy and/or its general disdain for end users, and people want to leave Facebook, but have no comparable platform to move their social networking to.  The title text uses ""you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch"" as both point and counterpoint in an argument, since this fact has both negative (your parents won't see posts you want them to see, and won't be able to post things for you to see) and positive (your parents won't see posts you don't want them to see, and you won't have to worry about keeping up with their posts) implications.","Megan: You should join Google+!

929: Speculation,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/929:_Speculation,internet,"I was pretty good at skeet shooting, but was eventually kicked off the range for catching the clay pigeons in a net and dispatching them execution-style.'","During a basketball game, the players discuss the nature of universal conformity. Facebook and Google+ are competing social networks, at the time of this comic many people were switching to Plus over Facebook leading many to speculate that Facebook was in decline and that Plus would soon be the dominant social network. (Incidentally, as of 2017, it seems that Facebook has successfully held its position as the Default Social Network™, while Plus has largely become known as ""that thing YouTube tried to make us all sign up for once"".)  The two players seem to have a disagreement over this. One player states that it would be ridiculous to expect everyone to move to Plus. The other player denies the notion that they have to, valuing his personal preference over conformity. He supports this by saying that his mother still uses AOL and other people continue using IRC, if each time a new dominant social network emerged and everyone switched to it neither of these things would stick around.  They are interrupted when they pass the ball to Black Hat who immediately shoots it with a crossbow bolt. Their arguments and rather intelligent discussion are derailed by the absurdity of Black Hat's reaction which is both humorous and puts the issue in stark contrast.  Black Hat neither joins in the discussion nor does he participate in the game and it seems that any offer to participate in either is met with a blunt and clear denial. He is simply not a conformist.  In the title text Black Hat continues to provide an example of his tendency to play by his own rules. A clay pigeon is a clay disc that is thrown into the air and serves as a target on a skeet shooting range. Participants are expected to shoot the pigeons with a shotgun but Black Hat would rather capture the clay pigeons and shoot them from a very close range. This is made even more humorous by the excellent crossbow skills he shows in the comic. This practice eventually got him expelled from the shooting range.","[Two Cueball-like guys are playing basketball. The right guy (Cueball) attempts to throw the basketball through the hoop, but it bounces off down to his friend. To the right Black Hat has his back to the other two while he is looking at his phone.] Friend: Do you seriously think everyone will move to Plus? It was hard enough getting them on Facebook.  [The friend has caught the rebound and now passes the basketball back to Cueball. Black Hat is not shown.] Cueball: Do they have to?

935: Missed Connections,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/935:_Missed_Connections,internet,The Street View van isn't going to find out anything Google won't already know from reading my email.,"Missed Connections is a page on Craigslist in which people who saw each other briefly and want to reconnect attempt to find each other again. In the case of missed connections, one person describes themselves ""Me"" and describes the other person ""You"" in order that the second person would recognize themself and try to reconnect.  The first entry appears to be a goofy joke, although there have been many Wienermobile incidents in the past. Given the timing of this comic, one can't help but wonder if it might also be a pun referencing the then recent resignation of Rep. Anthony Weiner over tweeting pictures of his, well, wiener with his mobile device.  The second entry refers to a person (you) looking down into a wishing well (presumably to throw in a coin to get a wish), but someone (me) is sitting down in the well with a harpoon looking up spotting the silhouette at the top of the well. This seems like a very weird thing to do, and the vaguely human shadow may be lucky to be alive, since the only reason the ""you"" should know about the ""me"" is if the me fired the harpoon (and missed). A person sitting in a well telling people stuff (as if it was the well speaking) was the pun in 568: Well 2. Oddly enough, this entry could possibly be a reference to this episode of The Fairly OddParents.  The third entry is a reference to networking. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. UDP packets don't use handshaking to verify they have contacted the correct host, so they can get lost or confused. The Cisco router location is a block of IP addresses that was unallocated at the time when this comic was published but has been allocated to Latin America and Caribbean since then. Cisco is a company that makes networking equipment. This is a play on a missed connection for someone who was lost and asked for directions.  The fourth entry is a reference to two events in 2011 in which President Barack Obama invited rappers--among other people--to the White House. After each event, right-wing commentators blasted the event as a party unbecoming of the dignity of the White House. Nancy Pelosi is the Democratic Leader of the US House of Representatives. The acronym (D-CA) is a common notation for politicians which notates party (D for Democrat) and state (CA for California). Pelosi would have also been invited to these events, and the missed connections listing is a reference to what the commentators imagined the event would have been like. A ""juggalo"" is a term referring to a fan of the rap group Insane Clown Posse (which includes rapper Violent J), which is notorious for having wild, misogynistic and violent fanbase.  The fifth entry is a straightforward joke. One of the two people getting married was so distracted by their phone they have no clue where their spouse is now, or even who they are. Alternatively, it could be that the second party deserted the wedding because they were frustrated by their partner being distracted by their cell phone during the wedding, and the first partner is now hoping to convince them to return.  The sixth entry is a reference to how the Google Street View car was not only recording photos of the street in 360 degrees, it was also collecting data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. The comic takes this to the next level, that the Google Street View van also scans what we have in our pockets and does a retinal scan. In this case, the social security number referenced is the most used SSN of all time. The retinal scan takes this even further, indicating that Google's cameras are collecting fine enough images to identify people by Retinal scan.  The entry gets a bit absurd when you realize with all this data, it should be trivial for the Google employee to ID and meet this young man, and would not need the Missed Connections page.  The last entry suggests that Babe Ruth, the American baseball slugger of 1914-1935, is actually a Time Lord. Time Lord is a reference to the popular sci-fi series Doctor Who in which The Doctor, who is a Time Lord, uses a TARDIS, which is a time travel machine. Possibly because he was a baseball player ""ahead of his time"".  The title text is another reference to the privacy concerns surrounding Google Street View van, to which Google responded by claiming that the street view camera wouldn't capture anything that someone walking by wouldn't be able to see. Randall is not worried about the street view van since he expects that Google will already know anything that such a van could discover from reading his e-mails. This last statement is of course much more serious that having a photo taken by a passing van, thus making it clear what people should fuss about, and it is not the van.","[The page is set up like the missed connections area of Craigslist, with a list of messages from an individual to a person they weren't able to communicate with at the time.

The phrase that Cueball used to use when he heard a random phrase was ""would be a good name for a band."" With the advent of Tumblr, his go-to response has shifted because of the proliferation of Tumblr blogs with strange names.  Raccoon Sex Dungeon is an actual Tumblr page. See trivia below.  In the title text he muses on the fact that Dot Tumblr Dot Com would be an awful band name. There could be several reasons for this, but he mentions that it would be hard to direct fans to the band's website. As an example, someone who hears ""www.thedottumblrdotcom.com"" might instead write it out as ""www.the.tumblr.com.com"" since '.' is often pronounced as ""dot."" If the band's website was hosted on Tumblr, then their website would be ""dottumblrdotcom.tumblr.com"".

1034: Share Buttons,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1034:_Share_Buttons,internet,The only post to achieve perfect balance between the four was a hilarious joke about Mark Zuckerberg getting caught using a pseudonym to sneak past the TSA.,"This comic is a commentary on what sort of articles work best on different social networking services. From left to right the share buttons are: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google+.  The title text humorously combines appealing subjects for all four networks:","[A series of article titles with four share buttons underneath each: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google+]  Breaking Into Stand-up Comedy FB: 3, Twitter: 1,781, Reddit: 2, G+: 0  How the Christian Right Threatens Wikipedia FB: 1, Twitter: 0, Reddit: 2,241, G+: 3  Boycott Facebook Today!

1045: Constraints,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1045:_Constraints,internet,[title-text similarly alphabetized],"An epigram is a brief, interesting, usually memorable and sometimes surprising or satirical statement. Constrained writing is an age-old literary phenomenon, where writers impose rules or patterns in their works. Haiku is a well known example of this.  Twitter is a short message social network and communication service. All messages (known as tweets) on the service need to be under 140 characters. Until August 2015 even private messages had that restriction. Twitter is frequently used by well-known comedians as a place to make interesting jokes and observations.  All the words spoken by Megan, from ""Yeah"" to ""alphabetization"", are in reverse alphabetical order. Here are the starting letters (with extra letter when more than one word in a row begins with the same letter):   It both answers Cueball's question and exemplifies with an ingenious self-reference, while being short enough (133 characters) to be a valid tweet — hence the ""whoa.""  The title text, ""title-text similarly alphabetized"", is also backwards-alphabetized and self-referential. Starting letters:","[Cueball sits in an office chair at his computer desk, motioning toward the screen with a hand as Megan stands behind him.] Cueball: I don't get why authors and comedians spend so much energy trying to be clever on Twitter. Couldn't they put that creativity into more books and scripts?  Cueball: Is there something they like about the 140-character format?  [Same picture but in a frame-less panel, except Cueball has taken his arm down.] Megan: Yeah. Writers working under tight restrictions produce novel material—like, for example, epigrams employing backward alphabetization.  [A slim panel with only Cueball at his computer desk shown.] Cueball: ...Whoa."
1057: Klout,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1057:_Klout,internet,"Though please do confirm that it's actually *me* on Klout first, and not one of my friends trying to get me punched. The great thing about this douchebag deadman switch is that I will never dare trigger it.","Klout is a site that seeks to measure your ""influence"" on social media networks. They sometimes give away ""perks"" to the users with the highest Klout scores, as a means of advertising the products of their sponsors. Generally, the information provided by Klout is not held in high esteem. The type of person who takes most interest in their score is typically not well-liked.  There are multiple ways that Klout measures your influence. An example of increasing influence is having been given a +K (a recommendation for a higher score) for knowledge about ""Pitbull"" (The Bud Light promoter and producer/rapper/musician, etc., not the type of dog). Another could be having an inspiring tweet that generated 2000 retweets. Klout supports many social networks, and ranks people based primarily on how much reaction they garner from the public. For example, if Selena Gomez tweeted that she simply loved a certain blog, she would probably get more people to visit that blog, and thus get a bigger Klout score, than if the mayor of Anchorage, Alaska tweeted that he liked that blog. Or xkcd publishing a comic about Klout would lead to an all time high in Google searches for it. However, their ""about us"" page does claim that a small, active group of followers is considered more influential than a large, passive group of followers.  The gist of the comic is that Cueball (here representing Randall) does not feel that Klout agrees with his core values, probably as he prefers self-assurance to having an outside authority tell him of his importance to society. He uses this comic to give himself incentive to stay away from Klout. He is very clear that he is dead serious about anyone meeting him after he has (been proven to have) used Klout should punch him in the face. He even makes sure that he cannot later retract this statement, if he for instance becomes interested in Klout (something he never wish for). Because his last statement is that people should ignore anything he says to retract this statement later.  Randall will now have a problem though because since he also posted the 706: Freedom comic earlier, he will never knows if people that hit him does because they believe he has used Klout or just to exercise their free will.   In the title text a ""dead man's switch"" is any mechanism which is designed to activate if the user does not take any action. This is generally used to create a failsafe in case the user is incapacitated  For example, many exercise treadmills include a tether meant to connect the runner to the machine's base station. If the runner gets too far from the base station, the tether pulls a pin and the machine stops immediately. This way, if the runner has fallen or is struggling to keep up, the machine does not exacerbate an already unsafe situation. Randall's ""douchebag deadman switch"" is a variation that would trigger if he ever became enough of an asshole to use Klout. This would lead to him being constantly punched in the face, so he doesn't dare become that type of person.  Shortly after this comic was posted, a Klout user was created claiming to be Randall. This was a fake, so if you ever meet Randall in real life, please don't punch him.","[Randall has drawn himself as Cueball in a slim panel:] Randall: I'd like to ask a favor.  Randall: If someday, in the future, we meet in person,  [Zoom out of Randall talking.] Randall: And if, as of that day, I've interacted with Klout in any way except to opt out,  Randall: I want you to punch me in the face without warning.  [Zoom in on Randall's head.] Randall: This may sound like a joke, so let me be clear:  Randall: I am dead serious.  Randall: Ignore anything I say retracting this.  Randall: Thank you."
1085: ContextBot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1085:_ContextBot,internet,"If you read all vaguebooking/vaguetweeting with the assumption that they're saying everything they can without revealing classified military information, the internet gets way more exciting.","This comic is a commentary on the practice of ""vaguebooking"" or ""vaguetweeting"", which is posting a short message of sadness or frustration without context.    Google has been criticized more than a few times for keeping rather extensive data records on its users, who by this point constitute most of the internet, enough to cause serious damage if Google wasn't historically altruistic (as altruistic as a for-profit company can be). In the comic, ContextBot is a fictitious Google invention which puts context for these statuses, presumably based on all that personal data which Google has collected:  As noted by the subtitle, ContextBot is considered a great good by everyone who was sick of vaguebooking. This also redeems Google's practice of all those data records in the public's eye.  In the ContextBot's avatar image, three people can be seen together hanging out. But the image is about to be cropped, leaving out the third person and therefore giving the impression that the two people in the cropped image are there without that person. This demonstrates how context is important to understanding a situation.  The title text refers to the cryptic ways in which someone with sensitive information must communicate. While most vaguebooking/vaguetweeting is about things of little importance, the title text implies that the things not mentioned impact national/global security. This implies that many tweets may actually be related to high-clearance military and or national security information, but must be vague in order to keep it secret, and if you take that as the context, then the internet suddenly becomes much more exciting.","[A social network feed with four status updates from four different people. Each one has a reply from the same account, which is called 'ContextBot', underneath.] Close-up face with glasses: The things I put up with... ContextBot: (His building's WiFi doesn't reach the bathroom.) Male female couple: You'd think by now I'd have learned never to trust anyone.

1143: Location,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1143:_Location,internet,Ingress: Foursquare With Space Noises.,"Ingress is an augmented reality location-based service game in which players have to visit certain real-world places marked by the game as containing in-game objectives called portals (much like in its well known offspring Pokemon GO). The single guy in the comic owns a home surrounded by an abundance of portals, which makes it an attractive destination for the three friends who contact him via the computer. They are obviously not really friends of the guy, but just wish to come by because of the portals.  The portals in the comic are controlled by the green ""Enlightened"" team (and have links and a field), making them valuable resource caches for the ""Enlightened"" team, and priority targets for the blue ""Resistance"" team.  Foursquare, referenced in the title text, is another service that lets users check into places they visit for discounts in a similar way to how Ingress players visit portals for points. Unlike Foursquare places, which are businesses and public places such as parks, Ingress portals also include historic houses that are still private residences, as well as churches, so Ingress is more likely to reward people visiting a friend's house. ""Space noises"" refers to the ambient sounds when playing Ingress.","[Three people around a computer. One of them is typing.] Typing: Hey, party tonight?

1150: Instagram,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1150:_Instagram,internet,"I'm gonna call the cops and get Chad arrested for theft, then move all my stuff to the house across the street. Hopefully the owners there are more responsible.","As indicated by the title, this comic is an allegory for a controversy over Instagram, a photo-sharing social network now owned by Facebook. In December 2012, Instagram changed their terms of use, allowing the network to sell user-uploaded images, without profit to the content generators. This infuriated many users, who closed their accounts or stopped uploading images.  In the comic Cueball tells his Cueball-like friend about his problem with Chad, who just send him a note telling him that he no longer wants to store all this stuff that Cueball has left in his garage. Cueball left it there because Chad has nice shelves and lets him in to see his stuff whenever he wishes, so that was really convenient.  Chad's note tells Cueball that he has a month to move his shit - after that he will try to get rid of it by selling it on Craigslist. This is a website where individuals can contact others interested in buying or selling goods. As a verb, it means to sell something on Craigslist. (FYI is an abbreviation of  For Your Information).   Cueball is outraged, as this is not way to run a storage business. But when his friend asks him if he paid anything for this ""storage business"" it turns out that he did not. The friend then concludes that it is not a storage business.   This is exactly the problem with Instagram (or its users). A user does not pay anything, but to create an account you have to sign a terms of service/end user license agreement. A user has thus effectively signed their consent to whatever Instagram has written. Instagram can then change these terms if they give a forewarning (as Chad has done here). Unfortunately, most users don't read the terms before clicking the ""I agree"" option, so it can come as a shock when Instagram uses the data in a way the user hadn't anticipated.   Instead of getting angry Cueball should thus just go and remove his stuff, but instead he is just going to almost (but not quite) stop giving Chad any more stuff.   This is also making fun of those Instagram users that complain about the new way of using their data, but at the same time keep uploading more pictures. The users have often developed a kind of addiction, so they cannot just stop sharing their life (in pictures).  In the title text Cueball continues with an idea of calling the cops. He thinks that Chad is a thief. He thus ignores that he left the stuff at Chad's house of his own accord. And after Chad has been arrested (which will of course never happen) he wishes to move all his stuff to another house, just to continue to get free storage.   There are two major flaws in this logic - and it is the same with the logic of the disgruntled Instagram users. You cannot accuse Instagram of stealing because it was you who gave them the images in the first place, and it is irresponsible to assume that this will not happen if you give your photos to another social networking company (like Facebook).  These kind of issues (with Facebook as the evildoer) are also the subject of 743: Infrastructures and 1390: Research Ethics.","[Cueball, raising a hand, is talking to his Cueball-like friend who is sitting by his computer.] Cueball: I've been putting all my stuff in Chad's garage. Cueball: He has nice shelves. Cueball: And he lets me in to see it whenever I want.  [In the next panel, without a frame, there is a close up of a note.

This is no way to run a storage business! Friend (off-panel): Are you paying him to look after your stuff?  [Final frame almost like the first frame, but Cueball has taken his hands down.] Cueball: No. Friend: Then what he runs isn't a storage business. Cueball: Well, I'm this close to not giving him any more stuff. Friend: That'll teach him."
1239: Social Media,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1239:_Social_Media,internet,The social media reaction to this asteroid announcement has been sharply negative. Care to respond?,"This comic parodies how journalists tend to focus on social networking. Specifically in the case of revolutions, social media is given a lot of weight, even in countries with limited internet access. A direct parallel is made to the so-called Twitter Revolutions.  On Twitter you can send text messages with a maximum of 140 characters. This means that there could not be much content in a single post, but often many people follow the people doing these tweets. People who are not on social media tend to react like Cueball and come to the conclusion that twitter makes press coverage more stupid, just because those messages lack much detail. Cueball is also surprised about the stupidity of trying to link social media to the orbit of the asteroid — social media obviously has no impact on the orbit of any space objects, which are entirely driven by physics and gravitational mechanics, and are not influenced by opinions on any media.  The title text continues the joke. The negativity on Twitter concerning an earth bound asteroid has nothing to do with the press conference that announced it but rather with the negativity of wiping out life on earth in general. Again, journalists give undue weight to social media.  It's simply that ""How has twitter affected this"" has become a standard question for journalists, posed in complete disregard of the actual event.","[Cueball heads a press conference.] Cueball: NASA has confirmed that the asteroid is heading directly for us. Cueball: ...Yes, a question? Reporter 1: What role has social media played in this asteroid's orbit? Cueball: *sigh* Reporter 2: Has twitter changed the way we respond to asteroid threats? Cueball: Well, it's made the press conference questions stupider. Reporter 3: Fascinating! Reporter 4: What about Facebook?"
1250: Old Accounts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1250:_Old_Accounts,internet,"If you close an account while it's still friends with people, it contributes to database linkage accumulation slowdown, which is a major looming problem for web infrastructure and definitely not a thing I just made up.","Cueball is very dramatically following the described process of removing himself from a social network by first unfriending each contact. Such actions are not necessary on any well-designed website. Actively unfriending people individually could be perceived as rude, antisocial, or in need of help.  Even though one may not have visited a social network for years, they are still sitting there, gathering one's ""friends""' statuses, opinions and comments.   The reverse order to unfriend people refers to correct memory allocation and deallocation processes for computers. If one does not follow this process and deallocates an older memory block before a newer one, all information about the newer block could be lost. This would prevent the user from being able to deallocate it. If the process repeats over and over, memory usage will accumulate and will eventually result in an out of memory error.   This is not needed on databases, but databases used on websites, such as social networking sites, could run into a similar issue. If accounts are deactivated the users that were friends to the deactivated account may maintain the link to the deactivated account. This could (if the database was not well designed) create a non trivial amount of garbage data.  In the title text, ""database linkage accumulation slowdown"" really is a thing that Randall just made up. This may be a satire of popular fears of made-up technological problems, often held by those who are not technologically savvy.","[Caption above the frame:] The internet is filled with derelict accounts aggregating news about friends long forgotten.  [Cueball sits at a desk, typing on a laptop and the responding text follows as:] *Click* Uhh, is everything OK? *Click* Dude, what the hell? *Click*  [Caption below the frame:] When you find yourself drifting away from a community, remember to clean up after yourself by slowly unfriending everyone, one by one, in the reverse order that you added them."
1320: Walmart,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1320:_Walmart,internet,"What I really want is to hang out where I hung out with my friends in college, but have all my older relatives there too.","This comic satirizes the way in which large social networks, such as Facebook and Google+, attempt to aggregate all aspects of the user's online social presence. Earlier social networks had more granular focuses; e.g. MySpace originated with a music focus, and even earlier various bulletin board systems were centered around specific topics. By contrast, many social media companies attempt to encapsulate the variety of aspects of their users' online lives, thereby aggregating their personal, professional, and private lives in a way that was previously unlikely to occur.  The first comparison to Walmart, a large multi-national ""big box"" retailer that sells everything from gardening supplies to televisions to groceries, is apt because Walmart, too, is attempting to aggregate various aspects of your life into a single location - but rather than aggregating your social media presence, it's attempting to aggregate your shopping habits.  The punch line of the joke is that social interactions at Walmart are awkward, contrived, and frequently undesired — just as they can grow to become in a social network that is insufficiently focused or too bloated. People communicate differently with different groups of people, and if they are attempting to connect with friends, they are unlikely to want their grandparents present. Similarly, if a person is attempting to buy groceries, he may not be interested in extended small talk with acquaintances with whom he may not share much in common (perhaps the fact that they both shop at Walmart is the biggest similarity they share).  The title text elaborates on this idea by sarcastically implying that he wants all his older relatives to hang out where he hung out in college, likely causing extreme awkwardness.","When a network tries to become everyone's one-stop hub, the Walmart of social interaction... [Cueball and Hairy standing in a supermarket, Cueball holding groceries under his arm, Hairy with a cart.] Cueball: Oh, uh, hi! Funny running into you here. Hairy: Oh, hey! Yeah! How've you been? ...it inevitably becomes the Walmart of social interaction."
1362: Morse Code,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1362:_Morse_Code,internet,"Oh, because Facebook has worked out SO WELL for everyone.","Cueball recounts the last message sent in morse code by the French maritime radio station Le Conquet radio upon retiring its 500 kHz channel.  The poetic, and potentially angsty-sounding nature of the message reminds him of the on-line journal website LiveJournal, which was popular until the late 2000s (it was launched in 1999), and stereotypically used by angst-ridden teenagers to post song lyrics, poems, or cryptic messages to express their emotions and possibly fish for attention. Since Cueball never uses his LiveJournal account any more, he wonders if he can find the password again. He might be considering posting the final Morse Code message as his own last and final message on his LiveJournal.  The popularity of the site died down considerably with the arrival of social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook, Google Plus and the advent of microblogging platforms like Twitter and Tumblr. LiveJournal has also lost a lot of users since a Russian company bought them out; Russian dissidents used LiveJournal to present their opinions, and the Russian government used to retaliate by creating ""denial of service"" attacks which make LiveJournal unusable for all its users, sometimes for days. Nowadays (May 2014) LiveJournal is still quite popular among Russian-speaking people, including dissenters, but its administration was forced to show HTTP 451 error in some cases (e. g., when a user with a Russian IP is trying to read Alexei Navalny blog) with new laws. Thus when Megan is upset with his desire to let LiveJournal die out like the Morse Code, Cueball describes it as ""a nice place to go for some peace and quiet"".  The title text is Megan's (or Randall's) sarcastic remark indicating that Facebook is no less filled with angst-ridden thoughts than LiveJournal was, nor is it free from problems or controversies around other issues such as security or privacy.  Randall is no stranger to LiveJournal. xkcd started on LiveJournal [1] before xkcd.com was created and is even still alive today [2].  The Morse code for the final message ""this is our final cry on 500 khz before eternal silence"" is:  A period is a very short tone while the hyphen represents a slightly longer one. Between each character there is a small pause. This message was typically sent within less than half a minute.","[Cueball and Megan are lying in a grassy, lonely plain.]  Cueball: When the French navy retired morse code in 1997, they broadcast a final message: ""Calling all. This is our last cry before our eternal silence.""  Cueball: I wonder if I can find my Livejournal login. Megan: Hey, I like Livejournal. Cueball: It's a nice place to go for some peace and quiet, I suppose."
1390: Research Ethics,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1390:_Research_Ethics,internet,"I mean, it's not like we could just demand to see the code that's governing our lives. What right do we have to poke around in Facebook's private affairs like that?","This comic references the recent revelation that Facebook engaged in a ""psychological experiment"" by selectively showing users more ""positive"" or ""negative"" posts on their news feed and recording the users' comments to see if the change affected the positivity or negativity of their posts. Further experiments have since been revealed such as one that tested security measures by locking users out of their accounts.  Here, Megan is commenting on the fact that, while the media is calling this control over what content the user sees ""unethical,"" Facebook, and other companies like Google, must, one way or another, control what content the user sees, whether to present users with a limited selection of all postings, or to tailor ads to particular users; even if the regular algorithms are not set up for psychological experiments, they are still ""manipulating"" what posts users see or don't see. As Megan points out, no one really knows what the ""normal"" constraints are of the algorithm which chooses which posts are shown on news feeds. This comic is parodying the strong reaction to what is basically already a common practice.  Accumulation, control and analysis of user-generated information can be a part of the terms of service/end-user license agreement of a Website or software. In such a scenario, the user has effectively signed his/her consent to being part of such research. Unfortunately, most users don't read the terms before clicking the ""I agree"" option, so it can come as a shock when the service uses the data in a way the user hadn't anticipated.  The title text ironically/sarcastically accepts that Facebook has access to all of its users thoughts through posts and photos, and they can read them for research or other purposes, but contrasts this with a suggestion which likely mirrors how Facebook would respond to such a request that Facebook's code is private and can not be revealed to us. The title text basically appears to be musing that this is backwards, and our personal data should be considered MORE private than Facebook's programming code, which may be proprietary, but is not personal private data.  It is as if your neighbor was spying on you while you left all your shades open, but you felt it to be inappropriate to find out what he knew about you because that's his business. Asking for the source code might similarly be equivalent to asking for the specifications of the binoculars your neighbor used for spying.","[Megan is facing Cueball and Ponytail.] Megan: Facebook shouldn't choose what stuff they show us to conduct unethical psychological research.

In this comic, Randall takes that notion to its extreme, envisioning a program that does this note-by-note, rather than just song-by-song. As songs play several dozen notes a minute (and some songs, many more), this would lead to the flooding of friends' notification streams. In the example, the software is sharing the notes that Brian is listening to; and his friends Mike and Caitlin are getting annoyed with the number of posts they are receiving.  There are typically many hundreds of notes in any song.  Any song with more than a single line of music contains multiple different notes whose names according to the English convention are communicated here. All but the slowest songs will require reporting dozens to hundreds of notes every minute (a single glissando may cover a dozen or more notes in less than a second), meaning that anyone who can see your stream of posts will be literally inundated by posts from the service. Even if you could keep up with the speed of the posted notes that someone is listening to, the similarity in phrases in many songs (especially pop songs, e.g. Pachelbel's Rant) means that many different songs may include the same sequence of notes, though possibly in different octaves or at different speeds.  The comic's title alludes to the fact that you can ""play a song"" but can also ""play a note."" It may also allude to the visual similarities between the hash/pound/number sign (#) and the sharp sign (♯). C sharp, above Mike's comment, is the only note not given by a single letter (after the correction - see Trivia).  The title text continues the joke of this new musical service: If you click on the post, it takes you to search results for the note on various online music store. Since many songs in similar keys contain at least some of the notes posted, you would be given a list of a large part of the music you can buy in any on-line music stores. Of course this is at least as useless as being told which note someone is listening to.  They appear to be the beginning of I'll Be There For You by The Rembrandts, the title music of the TV series ""Friends"".  This could be an internal reference to the idea that it ""notifies"" (converts into musical notes) your ""friends"" of the notes (a play on words). Alternatively it could simply be an instance of effective nerd sniping.","[A social network news feed with user images for each of the three different contributors.

1608: Hoverboard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard,internet,,"The ""comic"" is actually a browser game made to celebrate the release of Randall's new book, Thing Explainer, which was released on the same day as this comic: Tuesday November 24, 2015. The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The title refers to a hoverboard (which resembles a hovering skateboard without wheels) which has been most prominently featured in the movie Back to the Future Part II, which took place in the future, until a little more than a month before this comic was released. Marty McFly traveled to the future in this second installment, more precisely to 2015-10-21, and this comic was released just over one month later 2015-11-24. Hoverboards are just one of many things predicted in Back to the Future Part II that hav e come to pass before reaching the date from the movie, but are more uncommon in our world, along with other inventions like flying cars and musical clothing. Randall is known to have had electric skateboards, which is also thematically related, although another type of hoverboard would be mentioned just five weeks later in 1623: 2016 Conversation Guide. Given Randall's enjoyment of movies and time travel it is very likely that this game is also a tribute to the Back to the Future movies. But the release day of the game has been used to promote his new book (as is clear with the text in the start screen of the game), and this explains why it was not released on the Back to the Future date. Apart from the date of release and the text about the book, the game does not seem to have any direct relation to the book; there are, however, several scenes in the game that could be seen as references to Thing Explainer. Instead the main part of the game is all the references to several movies and other stuff that has often been featured in xkcd as well as many of the other comics.","[This transcript only covers the starting page as shown on xkcd: xkcd 1608.

A bot replying to comments with ""woosh"" at random would be very confusing, as people would search for the nonexistent joke they missed. This is similar to 559: No Pun Intended.  ""Comment of the year,"" just like the original bot reply, could be taken two ways but both would likely cause confusion. Either the reader takes the ""CotY"" at face value, implying that the original comment is extremely significant, or as a sarcastic quip, which would give it basically the same meaning as ""woosh"", suggesting that the commentor had an unoriginal or ridiculous idea.  ""Are you for real"" implies that the commenter (the bot) doesn't believe that the original commenter is serious. It could also imply that the person to whom the bot is replying to is a famous celebrity, and the commenter wants to know if the person who posted the original comment is a real celebrity and not fake, but this seems unlikely given the context.  ""I'm taking a screenshot so I can remember this moment forever"" either adds an implied air of extreme importance, hilarity or significance to a comment, or sarcastically suggests that the comment was unoriginal, useless, or otherwise unimportant. People who read it might assume that there is a hidden joke or meaning somewhere inside the original comment.

1642: Gravitational Waves,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1642:_Gravitational_Waves,internet,"That last LinkedIn request set a new record for the most energetic physical event ever observed. Maybe we should respond. ""Nah.""","Megan, Cueball, and Ponytail are observing the results from a gravitational wave detector (see details below). This comic came out on the day that the first direct observation of gravitational waves was publicly announced on 2016-02-11. The actual event was recorded five months before on 2015-09-14, but it was not reported publicly before they were sure it was a real signal. It seems that Randall knew in advance about this announcement because this comic was published on a Thursday, not following the normal publish schedule, to coincide with the announcement, and there were no other comics released Friday that week. (The altered schedule could be viewed as a meta-reference to the warping of spacetime.) That scientists knew there might be an announcement on the way, and more details for the interested can be seen in these two videos from Space Time: Have Gravitational Waves Been Discovered?!? and LIGO's First Detection of Gravitational Waves! (See also their follow up The Future of Gravitational Waves).  This is the second time within a month that a new astronomical announcement (of something discovered months before the actual announcement) has resulted in a related comic. The first being 1633: Possible Undiscovered Planets.   From the patterns in the gravitational waves detected by this instrument, it might be possible to guess the nature of the event (e.g. two bodies with dissimilar masses circling a fixed point, two bodies with equal mass circling each other, collision of two massive bodies, etc.). It might also be possible to triangulate the location of the event. Based on these two facts (the location and nature of the event) we might be able to determine which astronomical bodies caused this event (and the status of those bodies afterwards). Thus, it provides an additional medium to observe the universe in addition to telescopes observing all kinds of electromagnetic radiation. This new medium might enable us to observe properties that we couldn't observe with the rest of our observation instruments.  However, the scientists in this comic appear to be receiving more than the expected signals from black hole collisions, they also receive gravitational spam messages, such as invitations from Linkedin, a mortgage offer, and an announcement of a social meet-up, rather than observing astronomical events (see table below).  There is also a joke on the social meet-up's use of the word local group because the 'Local Group' is also the technical name for the group of galaxies containing the Milky Way.  It is not clear if these so-called ""events"" are causing gravitational waves to be generated or if something, perhaps an alien civilization, is encoding spam messages in gravitational waves. It is plausible that aliens are using gravity waves to encode their messages, as we do something similar with electromagnetic waves to encode and send our messages. However, it would take an extremely advanced civilization to achieve gravity wave encoding. It requires the controlling of orbits and oscillations of super-massive bodies like the Sun, or more likely bodies ten times more massive than it. For example, the first event detected, both in this comic and in real life, was a merger of two black holes of roughly 30 solar masses each.  The title text makes the speculation, that something is sending spam encoded in gravity waves, seem more plausible, as it follows up with a joke that the message senders have gone to such a length that they caused the most energetic event recorded ever (perhaps on the scale of a few supernovae or black hole collisions). One of the scientists is so impressed with this effort that he suggests that they actually post a reply, but one of the other person declines with a ""Nah""! (As you should always do with spam, else you will just encourage the sender by making it clear that there actually is a receiver on this address.) Randall may have been referring to the fact that the detected event had a power output equal to 50 times that of the entire visible universe.  In 1365: Inflation gravitational waves are also mentioned.  A gravitational wave detector is a device used to measure gravitational waves, small distortions of spacetime that were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916. Gravitational waves are ripples in the spacetime fabric itself.  In layman terms, a gravitational wave is like moving a stone through water while partly submerged. It will cause waves on the surface of the water as it moves through it. These waves will spread away from the center of disturbance and as they move, they will cause the water molecules to oscillate around their mean positions. Similar waves are created in the space-time fabric when two celestial bodies interact with each other. If you concentrate on an area of the fabric far away from the point of disturbance, it can be observed that if the wave causes compression in one direction, it'll cause expansion of the fabric in the other. See this page for nice animations.  Note that anything with a mass will cause a gravitational wave. Just as waves created by small stones are tiny in comparison to waves created by huge rocks in water, the waves from humans moving around will be tiny compared to the waves created by celestial bodies. Also, the bigger the body, the stronger the wave and the farther away it can be detected. That is why we can only detect gravity waves from heavy bodies like black holes or neutron stars but not from us moving around.  Now, let's consider spacetime fabric as a thin rubber sheet. If you mark any two points on this sheet and stretch or compress it along the axis joining those two points, the relative positions of these points with respect to their neighboring points do not change, but the distance between them changes.  LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is a large-scale physics experiment designed to detect this compression/expansion, and it was LIGO who discovered the signal that caused this comic. (For a very detailed description of what the team at LIGO did and the history behind see this 90 minutes feature Gravitational Waves: A New Era of Astronomy Begins from the 2016 World Science Festival).  Two facts need to be remembered to easily understand the experiment. First, the speed of light (c) is constant and the speed of an object is the distance moved divided by the time taken to travel that far. Second, gravitational waves cause opposite effects (compression and expansion) in directions perpendicular to each other. At LIGO, an experiment is set up where two perpendicular long tunnels are constructed with apparatus to emit and detect laser beams. The beam from a laser is split into these two tunnels. After going through the tunnel and back again a few times the beams are brought back together. The lengths of the tunnels are set up in such a way that, in the absence of gravity waves, destructive interference between the two combined beams causes them to cancel one another out, resulting in the detector observing zero light intensity. When the gravitational wave passes through earth, one of the tunnel is expected to expand while the other is expected to compress. Due to the difference in lengths, the destructive interference is incomplete and the detectors will be able to detect the presence of light. This observation can be concluded as ""detection of the gravitational wave passing through"".","[Cueball, with arms up, is standing behind Megan who has her hands at her mouth, and who in turn is standing behind Ponytail, who is sitting in front of a large computer console with a screen, a keyboard, and several items on the side (presumably lights and labels).

1645: Toasts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1645:_Toasts,internet,Platonic solids for my real friends and real solids for my platonic friends!,"A toast is a ritual in which a drink is taken as an expression of honor or goodwill. The term may be applied to the person or thing so honored, the drink taken, or the verbal expression accompanying the drink. Thus, a person could be ""the toast of the evening,"" for whom someone ""proposes a toast"" to congratulate and for whom a third person ""toasts"" in agreement.  The comic is based on the quote Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends which, though often attributed to the painter Francis Bacon or to Tom Waits, is a toast dating back to at least the nineteenth century. It is also the entire title of a song, the ninth track on From  Under the Cork Tree, a 2005 album by Fall Out Boy.  The comic plays on a permutation structure between two words (a type of chiasmus), yielding puns with various effects.  In this comic eight persons drink a toast for their ""real friends"" and then for some other type of ""friends"". For the real friend they wish them to have one specific thing. This something is a word (X-Y) that can be split up in two meanings (X and Y), where one of them are then put in front the word friend, to explain what type of friends they are now toasting (often a bad/false type of friend) and then these friends get a wish for having what the word that are left of the original word means: ""X-Y for my real friends and real Y for my X friends""  The first example is a typical toast, in Champagne, where this word can be split in the two phonetically similar words Sham and Pain, and the sham friends then get pain. Below all examples (including the ninth from the title text) are listed with explanation for all words. In some cases the word may actually refer to a drink (like the first with champagne), so that the first word is not something wished for the real friends, but the drink that is in the glass (these have been mentioned below). But for other toasts there is no such drink in existence, and the first word is the thing the toaster wishes for the real friends.","[There are two rows of 4 panels each.

Although Twitter bots can be very elaborate, a lot of people write simple bots for fun that simply engage in automated wordplay.

The web searches he makes tell what happens next, i.e. the bot balloons in complexity until it starts following its own goals and Cueball no longer has any control over its actions.  This comic examines how a seemingly simple task can often balloon in complexity if all of the requirements are not understood, while at the same time presenting the stereotypical scenario where an unassuming idea results in the accidental creation of malevolent AI, which then attempts to destroy humanity.  The story, as told by the web searches, is as follows:","[Cueball is sitting at a desk using a laptop, his thoughts shown above in a thought bubble.

1656: It Begins,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1656:_It_Begins,internet,You can also try 'Yikes.',"This comic encourages the reader to post random news stories on the Internet, under the line ""It begins."" This creates a sense of impending doom, as well as making people wonder what, exactly, is being referred to. This could also encourage people to theorize about what, exactly, is beginning. It could also just confuse the intended audience, as they try to comprehend what the author is saying.  This could in the worst case speedily lead to several people making repost of such a non-news story that would not have gotten any attention otherwise. This may lead to speculation, and other curious theories, going out the tangent it could create fear or mass hysteria.  Some stories that might benefit especially from this are those relating to machine autonomy, animal attacks, disease, and so forth. This would call to mind various popular culture and/or scientific hypothetical scenarios.  Perhaps the comic's choice of article refers to Alfred Hitchcock's thriller The Birds, in which birds (especially seagulls) begin attacking humans for no apparent reason, or the broader idea of an animal revolution, or just that even animals get sick of us always looking at our smart phones.  The title text instructs readers to try the line ""Yikes"" instead. The idea is the same but would give a completely different response.  Other comics which advocate using catch-all phrases as standard responses for any comment:","[A post in Megan's news feed on some social network platform is shown.

1689: My Friend Catherine,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1689:_My_Friend_Catherine,internet,I can't get any work done because my friend Catherine is sitting on my keyboard.,"This is another comic using substitutions to create the joke by replacing words or phrases, in this case ""My cat"", with a different word or phrase, in this case ""My friend Catherine"" (hence the title). The choice of the name is probably because ""Cat"" is a common nickname for ""Catherine"".  By doing so in a list of people discussing things their cat did, it makes it seem like they are discussing things their female human friend did.  What is cute (sitting on keyboards), impressive (doing backflips to eat bugs), or at least normal behavior for a cat (vomiting hairballs) would often be weird, disgusting or disturbing if an adult human were to do it, which is what makes the substitution humorous.  The comic depicts a feed on a page for people discussing their cat, similar to Twitter or Facebook, which would be the only kind of place where the substitution is really funny. Apart from known characters like two looking like Cueball, Megan and Ponytail, there is also a person with black hair, not looking particularly like any standard characters, and then a person with a knit cap, which could be the same knit cap wearing user that was also used in 1506: xkcloud (see the  pictures of the users).","[Captions above the frame:] New favorite substitution: My Cat→My Friend Catherine  [A news feed with comments by six different people discussing their cat, but after the above substitution.

1711: Snapchat,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1711:_Snapchat,internet,"For obvious reasons, the prize is awarded at a different time of year from the others, while it's still fresh in the committee's memory.","Snapchat is a photo-sending app that allows the receiving user to only view the photo (known as a ""snap"") within 24 hours of its posting, and for only 10 seconds before it is deleted. The Pulitzer Prize is famously awarded for exceptional journalism and photojournalism (there are many categories; see here).  Cueball reads that the Snapchat Pulitzer Prize has just been awarded but then, when Megan states that she heard the picture was really good, Cueball becomes disappointed because he realises he has already missed out on the chance to see the prize winning entry due to the temporary nature of Snapchat. Note that Megan also missed the opportunity to see the snap.  A given snap can be sent to a semi-public ""Story"" and the user decides how long any user can see the snap in a range from 1-10 s. In principle, any specific snap is only accessible for 24 hours even if it is a story. A committee of users could have more than 10 seconds to access the snap, by viewing in sequence. Given the time it might take for a committee to decide which snap wins the prize, it is realistic that Cueball learns about the winner after the 24 hours is up; Thus even a user following the outcome might not be able to see the winning entry after that time. In practice it is possible to circumvent the Snapchat rule and take a screen shot or in other ways save the content of the snap. In the case of a Pulitzer Prize winning photo, someone would probably have saved it, if it was in real life. On the other hand, the only way for the photo to be recognised as a snap, eligible to win the prize, would be if no one could see it for more than 10 seconds. So one of the possible rules might be that any picture which was saved would not be able to win the prize.  The title text extends this ephemeral nature of Snapchat's content to the prize awarded for it: The other Pulitzer prizes are announced annually in April and awarded in May (except for 2016, the centennial year, when an awards dinner will be held in October). The Snapchat Pulitzer Prize alone must be awarded as quickly as possible after the winner has been decided, before the prize committee forgets what the winning picture looked like. This of course underlines how silly this idea is, because only images seen during the assembly of the prize committee can be seen and remembered, and it is not possible to arrange this based on any knowledge of when a Pulitzer Prize ""worthy"" snap will be released.  Randall could be making fun of Snapchat (see the title), and the idea that you cannot save the images for later; As mentioned regarding screenshots, it is actually very easy to save pictures from Snapchat - to many a user's regret after having sent something very personal, such as naked pictures of themselves. The comic could also be seen as mocking the Pulitzer Prize for having too broad a spectrum of categories. Alongside the (photo)journalistic and prose awards, the Pulitzers also honor a variety of artistic pursuits, including Poetry, Drama and Music.  The new medium of Snapchat is certainly a hybrid form of art and information/opinion dispersal, both at its best and at its worst, but it is too ephemeral for awarding prizes to be logistically possible even if it were taken seriously enough for someone to want to award them.  The very next comic, 1712: Politifact, features an organization which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2009.","[Cueball and Megan standing together. He holds a smartphone in his left hand and looks at it.] Cueball: Oh, the Pulitzer Prize for Snapchat was just awarded. Megan: Yeah. Megan: I hear the photo was really good. Cueball: Aw, maaaan..."
1757: November 2016,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1757:_November_2016,internet,"Once you've done this, make a note of how old they were. Then, when their age reaches double that, show them this chart again.","This is yet another comic designed to make you feel old, following soon after the last one 1745: Record Scratch. Not so long ago a comic with the very title of the largest bold letters in the caption above the panel was released: 1686: Feel Old. The next comic about feeling old, was released 11 months later, with a similar title, which is special in it self, 1898: October 2017 see more on both title and this follow up comic in the trivia section below.  Specifically this comic contains The November 2016 Guide to making people feel old. (The  unusual title for the comic indicates that it only works during this month). It lists ages between 16 and 41 and links each age to one or more events that happened approximately half that age ago, so 8 years ago for the 16 years old and 20 years ago for the 40 years old etc, which means that a person of that age would have had the mentioned thing in their life for the majority of their life. And then it explains that to make a person of a given [age] feel old, look up the [thing] (or things) connected to it, and say:      As an example the age 21 can be used, as it list both the Xbox 360 as well as this comic, xkcd itself. The two possible sentences would then be:  This matches earlier attempts to make people feel old by mentioning how long ago it was that, for instance, a movie comes out as was the case in 891: Movie Ages. (But on this exact day when the comic was released there might have many people who did already feel old an tired - see trivia). When an event seems to have occurred recently to you, like seeing a movie when you were twenty (with Toy Story) and then suddenly realizing that this was 21 years ago, you will very likely feel old. Since humans' perception of time is not related to how much time has actually passed but rather to important memories, then memories like seeing the first feature-length fully computer-animated movie (Toy Story) makes a big impression and may stay vivid in peoples' memories. When they then, after hearing the sentence from this comic, realize that more than half their life has passed since that event, they realize how much time has passed and that makes them feel old.  This is why it affects a 20-year-old to hear that Twitter is ten years old, where this will not have the same impact on a 16-year-old, since they were so young when it came out that they probably feel like it has been around for ever, and you do not feel old by hearing, for instance, something like that the TV was invented before you were born. It thus makes sense to pick something that happened almost midway through a person's life, because they then realize they are now double as old as when they first heard of Twitter. Of course also many ten years old would not have been active on Twitter when it was released, so it may not have that big an impact on those 20 years old today.  Actually many of the chosen things are something that Randall specifically has interest in and several of the chosen events or movies relates to things that are recurring subjects in xkcd, as can be seen by the long list of categories that belongs to this comic. And while movie series like Star Wars, The Matrix, X-Men, Shrek and Toy Story are probably well known to most of xkcd readers as are games like The Sims and Pokémon, books like Harry Potter and comics like Calvin and Hobbes, then there are other things that are either only known to xkcd readers, basically not to anyone or at least not to people who where only 8-12 years old when the thing occurred. And if the person was not even aware of the specific thing existing, or at least not aware of it at the time when it was new, then the impact of saying the sentence to them will be little to none. Basically the first three ages, 16-18 years, would fall into this category. At 8 years old you are not supposed to play any version of Grand Theft Auto (not that some might not do it), and Rickrolling is also mainly for young adults, not 8-9 years old children. Worst of all is the reference for age 18 to the, probably mostly unknown, movie Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, which is directed at adults, and thus definitely not at those children that where 9 years old when it was released.    Nintendo Wii for people at 10 years old is the first that might make an impact, as will Xbox 360, but then again not xkcd, which is not directed at 10-11 years old children. But, the entire comic is mainly made to make readers of xkcd feel old by letting them know how long all these items are. But for the big movies and events that most people know about, it might also work on people not interested in xkcd. See more regarding if the sentence would work or not in the table below.  The joke at the end is that people over 41 don't need anything to make them feel old, because they already feel old. He thus teases people above 41 years old by claiming they are old, although many people (above 40) would claim you are not old before you retire. This trick was also used to cap the above mentioned 891: Movie Ages to 35 years old, stating anyone as older was already old. But that comic was also released five years ago, and now Randall is himself closing in on 35 at 32 years at the time of this comics release. So he pushed the limit 6 years further, probably for this reason. Now he no longer thinks people at 36 are too old to try to make them feel old.  It may be a coincidence, but still interesting, that he stopped the list just before 42, a number Randall has referred to many times in relation to it being the ""Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"" in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  For something to have existed for the majority of someones life, it is supposed to be older than half the persons age, but it seems Randall went for just about half the age. For instance for a 35-year-old person (born 1981), it lists the release of the movie The Matrix, which was released March 31, 1999 making it very close to 17.5 years ago, fitting with half of 35 years. For the 41-year-old it is slightly more than half of their life that has included the movie Toy Story, which was released almost exactly 21 years before this comic in November 1995, compared to the 20.5 years from half of 41 years. The only entry on the list that seems to veer more than half a year from the half age is  the one for autotuned hit songs which seems to refer to 1998, maybe specifically starting with Cher's song Believe released on October 19, 1998, making it 18 years ago. But it is listed together with the age 33 years, which should thus have been connected with something around 16.5 years old (16-17 years). However, this entry is also one of the less time specific. However, the rule still applies, it's just the only one where it is such a big majority of the persons age (18 years in their life 15 years not in their life). See more in the table below.  The title text points out that the same chart can be used for the same person once they are twice as old. So it urges the user to note down the age of the person it was used on, and then wait until their age reaches double that. So for a 16-year-old that would only be 16 more years until they are 32, but for a 41-year-old it would have to wait until they are 82 years old. When showing them this chart, they will realize that this has existed for half of their life and again have the same type of ""feeling old"" that this comic is supposed to instigate today.(It will work better if they still remember the joke made on them those many years ago)...","[Caption above the panel:] The November 2016 Guide to making people feel old  [A chart with a list of items to be put into the two first lines above the chart.

1761: Blame,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1761:_Blame,internet,I bet if I yell at my scared friends I will feel better.,"Cueball states that he feels sad and links it with his observation that bad things are happening. Sadness is a normal human reaction to perceived bad events[1]. (Other emotions that might be felt at such times include anger and guilt.)  He then reasons that it must be someone's fault. If the ""bad things"" in question are not natural calamities or accidents, it is usually logical to surmise that someone is responsible for them taking place.  After some thinking, he has an idea. Ideas are usually the result of thinking (unless they are a result of computers[citation needed]), although it might not always be conscious thinking like Cueball is doing.  He then blames his ""friends on Facebook"", a social media website and app, for connecting with and talking to friends and family. While there could be possible reasons for bad events (for example if the bad event was nobody wishing him a happy birthday or someone posting compromising pictures,) his friends would not be a likely source for bad events extending beyond a personal or local scope. Most people have a few hundred (or thousand) ""friends"" on Facebook, most of whom do not have enough influence to cause bad events on a national or global level.[citation needed]  This is a reference to people ranting on social media sites (like Facebook) about various things which are blamed on certain people (or sometimes everyone), but the person doing the ranting never thinks that the problem might be with themselves.  It could possibly also be a reference to how an individual's Facebook news feed has probably been inundated by political posts due to the results of the recent 2016 United States presidential election where Donald Trump won, less than two weeks before the release of this comic. Just before the election Randall had shown his supported for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the comic 1756: I'm With Her. That this is indeed the reason is further supported by several other sad comics that followed later. These also seemed related to the election of Donald Trump. But this comic was the first. The second 1773: Negativity can actually be seen as a direct follow up to this comic. Because in that one Cueball finally goes outside his house to avoid all the negativity on-line (probably worsened when he blamed his friends for the bad things happening!).  One read on this is that, many people, including some news sources, have pointed out that social media forms an ""echo chamber"", and some sources have claimed that this is responsible both for political polarization (see this video) and even for the recent victory of Donald Trump in spite of Randall's endorsement of Hillary. Therefore, blaming social media for the election can be read as blaming his friends echoing his ideas back to him as causing (partially) Clinton's loss; thus they are (partially) at fault for his presumed sadness over her loss in the election.  A second read on this would be that constant reminders of Clinton's loss only serve to make Randall sadder: again the proximal cause being his friends' posts.  A third read would be that friends with whom Cueball/Randall disagrees are posting things that he finds unpleasant to read, either ideas that he finds offensive or inconvenient, or posts ""rubbing in"" the victory of the candidate Randall opposed.    The fourth meta-read is that Cueball (as very much distinct from Randall) is not especially smart, and Cueball's mistake here is something that Randall has seen other people make, and Randall is bitter that many people are making said mistake -- not only will venting on Facebook be counterproductive generally, in particular blaming your Facebook friends for the loss of your favored candidate will only make your interpersonal relationships more difficult, such venting will do nothing to correct the root cause of the sadness, partly because a small group of people is relatively powerless, and partly because the very nature of self-selecting Facebook friend-groupings forms a bubble of insular ideological uniformity.  Convincing yourself that your ideological allies are to blame, and then alienating your ideological allies by unfairly blaming them, is dumb; that is the point of the comic, that this ""bright idea"" that Cueball comes up with in panel three, is actually so dumb of an idea as to be humorous.    In real life, where Randall supported Hillary and is sad she lost, one might infer that Randall has seen real-life ideological allies blaming each other:  you should have worked harder for the campaign, you should have donated more, you never should have been mean to that Bernie supporter, you should have listened to me when I said we needed to get out the vote in Michigan, and so on and so on.  Finding a perceived problem, and then blaming your ideological allies as being the cause of that problem, makes it LESS likely that the actual problem will be corrected in future elections, thereby perpetuating the sadness.  Not only is Randall sad that his candidate lost the election, he is sad that Facebook 'friends' are accusing each other of being to blame, and he is expecting to remain sad in future election-cycles thanks to the disunity and infighting that were the byproduct of THIS election-cycle.  See also:  'vicious circle'.   Thus, the comic is actually intended to be entertaining, but also intended to have a moral lesson, like Aesop's fables:  if you lose an election because turnout for your candidate was lower across the board than in was in 2012 and 2008, picking fights with your ideological allies will not help you in 2020, because that will only further disunify the factions within your coalition.  The only way to increase turnout for one's preferred candidate, is to expand the coalition by bringing new voters -- and in some cases re-enticing former voters -- to join with you.  Difficult to do when you spend all your time blaming each other.  Somewhat ironically, this plain message is something that Randall cannot put forth... because telling your ideological allies that they need to stop blaming each other for the problems of the 2016 election-cycle, or they are gonna screw up the 2020 election-cycle, is in itself a way of blaming your allies!  Thus, the comic makes fun of people who blame their ideological allies for not being very bright, but also shows that Randall himself may not have been able to figure out what to do either... which is a cause for sadness, indeed, and one that cannot easily be corrected.  Even though Randall understands the problem, and can make humorous comics which illuminate the trouble, and poke fun at the counterproductive nature of blaming one's local allies for national or global setbacks, that does not mean he can keep people from falling into those counterproductive habits (himself included to some degree).   The title text refers to people venting. The (humorous) assumption here is that one will feel better after doing so. While some amount of venting might help to relieve stress caused by bad events, alienating people you know by blaming them for bad events usually causes more stress in the long run.  (See above explanation about how blaming ideological allies can become a vicious circle.) The fact that he recognizes his friends are scared, like him, but still thinks yelling at them is a good idea shows he's more interested in making himself feel better rather than caring about the well being on his friends.  Additionally, ""yelling"" on social media would likely only increase the influx of:   All of these would make him feel worse, potentially in relatively short order.","Cueball (thinking): I feel sad. Bad things are happening.  Cueball (thinking): They must be someone's fault. But whose?  [Cueball makes several thinking poses before a light bulb appears, indicating he has an idea]  Cueball (thinking): My friends on Facebook."
1765: Baby Post,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1765:_Baby_Post,internet,"[bzzzt] ""REMEMBER TO CHECK IN FOR YOUR FLIGHT TO LONDON."" ""My wha-"" [bzzzt] ""YOUR UBER WILL ARRIVE IN FOUR MINUTES.""","In this comic, Cueball is questioned about a series of posts made to his Facebook account.  Initially he explains the posts as the result of leaving his daughter (a baby, according to the title) unattended with his tablet.  Readers are meant to assume all posts were made by accident, which happens often to people with children.  This makes sense for the first two panels: sharing the same video six times could be the result of the child repeatedly hitting the same area of the screen (e.g. a ""share"" link), and the gibberish text ""FHFF,,,M,,,,"" could be due to the child randomly tapping on the screen as well, all without knowing what she has done.  The joke begins when Cueball discovers an apparent pattern in new posts, starting with a map of hardware stores and culminating in blueprints for the Tower of London.  These subjects, if they were chosen consciously by an adult, would strongly suggest the poster was planning a heist to steal the crown jewels.  It is very unlikely for a baby to be capable of designing and carrying out such a plan. [citation needed]  However, it is also very unlikely for these specific subjects to be posted all by accident.  The reader is thus left wondering what could have caused these posts, and whether Cueball and/or his daughter might know more than they let on.  Cueball's suggestion of ""keeping an eye"" on his daughter suggests he is seriously considering the possibility that she might be an evil genius.  The title text continues the joke by notifying Cueball that his flight to London is leaving soon, and an Uber driver is coming to pick him up. Since his daughter was using the tablet and he is surprised by the messages, this suggests she is in fact the mastermind who has already started executing her plan.  Either she is making the journey herself (and Cueball is only receiving notifications because he has the same accounts linked to his phone), or Cueball is being roped into the crime.  The crown jewels are famous in several movies for being overly complicated to steal, such as Minions. They are also mentioned in 1698: Theft Quadrants.  The comic is similar to 1419: On the Phone, though here it seems that the daughter isn't just a cover story. It is also somewhat similar to 576: Packages, in that Cueball seems weirder since it started.  [Ponytail is looking at something on her phone while talking to Cueball]  [Cueball is talking to someone on the phone while pushing a shopping cart with a few items in it]  [White Hat is holding his phone while walking with Cueball]  [Ponytail is looking at her phone while talking to Cueball]","Ponytail: Why did you post a The Wheels on the Bus Youtube video to Facebook six times? Cueball: Haha, whoops! My daughter was watching the tablet and must have hit something.  Phone: Hey, did you mean to post ""FHFF,,,M,,,,"" and a link to a map of hardware stores? Cueball: I should really look up how to lock the screen.  White Hat: You just posted videos on metal-working, zip lines, and camouflage. Cueball: Uhh...  Ponytail: Um, you posted blueprints of the Crown Jewel rooms in the Tower of London. Cueball: Maybe we should be keeping more of an eye on her."
1802: Phone,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1802:_Phone,internet,"[*disables social networking accounts*] [*social isolation increases*] Wait, why does this ALSO feel bad?","When someone asks you if you want to go for a walk they often expect to have a conversation, while enjoying both the exercise, the fresh air and the company. Thus any disturbance not related to the walk is not welcome. Going for a walk is often seen as a way to relax from all the daily stress, as it takes the walkers away from work and chores.   Cueball agrees to go for a walk, but not to all the associated expectations. His first instinct is to bring along his smartphone, though rather than call it such, he opts for a lengthy description detailing all the functions he intends to use. He describes the phone as a device that gives him a continuous (24/7) stream of information, much of which is often out of context. The stream contains people's opinions, context-free but scary news, and other random stimuli. Conspicuously, long-distance communication (ostensibly the primary function of a smartphone) is not listed. This may be a sign that Cueball is addicted to his phone.  The stream of opinions mentioned could be from news or bloggers but it could also just be from his friends on social media platforms. News stories that are shared on social media are often scary, which becomes even worse because news outlets are likely to use a title that exaggerates the topic to create a fear reaction. The random emotional stimuli could be from many things such as text messages/emails and pictures of kittens and babies on social network, and shared internet memes or viral videos. All things that could cause a quick shift in emotions.   As if all this was not enough, Cueball even says he will also take his spare battery, so he won't risk that his constant feed could be interrupted, because he will not be able to recharge his phone during the walk. All in all, his choice and constant need for staying updated and being online violates all the usual expectations, that his friend could have expected from asking him out for a walk. Randall's fear of running out of power on his smartphone was earlier mentioned in 1373: Screenshot, where a low battery charge stresses him too much to realize it is someone else screenshot, rather than his own phone that has a low charge.  The title text shows it would be possible to take an action to avoid this feed. In the first bracket a person (could be Cueball or Randall) disables all his social networking accounts. Most of his news feed will thus disappear. But this leads to the next bracket which states that such a choice would lead to increased social isolation, since he will no longer be in contact with any of his online friends. In fact, today many people also get into contact with their ""real"" local friends through social media, so one might thus miss out on events like parties or get-togethers.  In addition, his friends, not sharing his dislike for social media, may not understand his decision. All of this leads to the final sentence Wait, why does this ALSO feel bad?","[Someone off-panel asks Cueball a question which he answers while walking to a small table with some items laying on it.] Off-panel voice: Wanna go for a walk? Cueball: Sure, just need to grab my device that feeds me a 24/7 stream of opinions, context-free scary world news, and random emotional stimuli. Cueball: Plus a spare battery so the feed won't be interrupted."
1810: Chat Systems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1810:_Chat_Systems,internet,I'm one of the few Instagram users who connects solely through the Unix 'talk' gateway.,"The comic consists of an Euler diagram showing a wide variety of chat systems and their intersections. (Euler diagrams should not be confused with Venn diagrams, see more on this here). The comic demonstrates the complexity that can be involved in modern communications: simply remembering how to get in touch with someone can be a challenge.  Below is a table with explanation for all 24 mentioned chat systems and below that a list of each system's intersections with the other systems. Several of the systems are already considered old, like The ""chat"" tab in an old Google Doc, but some people keep using them, which is part of the joke. There only seems to be one ""chat"" system which could in no way be said to be an on-line chat system, and that is the Wall (bathroom) at the bottom, which refers to how people writes notes on public bathroom walls, making it an extra joke and possibly a reference to 229: Graffiti.  In the title text, Randall explains how he is one of the only few Instagram users to use the UNIX 'talk' gateway (an old peer-to-peer chat system whereby users logged into the same UNIX system could privately communicate with each other in a full-screen interface.) But he doesn't tell how he had enhanced this old fashioned software.  Note that this is similar to the earlier 949:_File_Transfer.  The 24 chat systems with the number of stick figures inside are listed. Notice there are only 23 real systems, as one of the systems is a bathroom wall.","[An Euler diagram with many circle like drawings for various chat systems is shown. Some circles overlapping others in complicated ways, others are single circles with no connections, but most are embedded into others.

1886: Typing Notifications,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1886:_Typing_Notifications,internet,"Over the years I've decided I'd rather have them on than not, but I'm glad there aren't ""has opened a blank note to compose a reply to you"" notifications.","Randall has sent a message on an instant messenger to someone else and is now watching the screen expecting a reply. The message contains simple questions about a show Randall must have undertaken and he insists on an honest answer. The phone indicates that the respondent is typing a response, but then pauses, resumes typing, and pauses a second time, before sending a simple ""It was great!""  Typing notifications, often called ""typing awareness indicator"", is a feature of some instant messaging systems. It lets you know when the other person in a conversation is typing and preparing a reply. It may appear in different forms, like the literal text ""[Contact] is typing."" or often has a empty answer (possibly a different color) containing three animated dots. It gives the sender confidence that their message has been received and the other one is working on a reply.  When the final response is received it is anodyne ""It was great"", suggesting that the first two deleted drafts could be far more critical. The fact that you know that a message has been deleted or edited twice provokes you to imagine what the deleted drafts may have contained. The issue with typing notifications that Randall is talking about might also just be the difficulty to interpret them. The distant contact might just have been doing something else at the same time, started typing in the wrong conversation, or corrected a typo, but because Randall has interpreted the long pauses the same way one would read face-to-face interactions, the typing notifications make it seem like they weren't honest.  If one partner of a conversation takes their sweet time to reply, possibly deleting their text and starting from scratch as shown in this comic, the typing notification feature can lead to anxiety, as the person waiting for a response starts to overthink the issue. Thoughts come to mind like the other person might not be honest, try to carefully word a sensitive subject or not care enough about you to quickly reply. If finally the answer arrives and consists of just a laconic ""ok"" or similar, these feelings become even stronger, leading to thoughts like the other person is trying to hide something. This phenomenon has become so widespread that many people have written about it in newspapers and blogs, calling it texting anxiety.  The caption below the screens summarizes that what Randall dislikes the most about these systems of notification that the other party on the conversation is actively working on a reply is the lengthly alternation between indications that the other party is composing a reply, amidst pauses wherein one presumes the other party is thinking carefully about what they are wanting to say, then more typing as in response to their deep thinking, etc. until at the end of this extended period when one expects the other side to have written a book's worth of notes given the time and work they appear to have dedicated to the reply -- and all they get is a simple 3-word reply.  It leaves him wondering what all the other party really typed, and really thought, that they ended up not sending.  One way around giving your text receiver texting anxiety would be to open a blank note and work out what you want to say there. Since you're not typing in the messaging app, there's no typing notification.    In the title text, Randall expresses that he likes to watch when the recipient reacts and is trying to write an answer but he's also happy to not receive notifications that the texter is composing a response in a blank note file. Typically, one composes responses in blank notes when they need to be careful or thoughtful about how they respond. If Randall were to be notified about such actions, it would confirm his above fears that the writer was being tactful and guarded in their response, which would just lead to more anxiety about what they were trying to hide.","[A sequence of eight panels representing the same conversation in an electronic chat. The header always reads:] What did you think of my show? Did you like it? Be honest!

1911: Defensive Profile,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1911:_Defensive_Profile,internet,"NO DRAMA ZONE -> If I've made you sad, you'd better not tell me, because I am TERRIFIED of that situation and have NO IDEA how to handle it.","This comic demonstrates a theoretical feature which provides more honest interpretations of social media profiles. We see a profile for a person who says they have ""no filters"" and has no qualms about offending or upsetting anybody with their seemingly radical views. But the ""translation"" of the description reveals that it is a vastly insecure person who seems to have the problem of saying the wrong thing every time and so their profile description is a way for them to justify their comments.   The title text continues, with the aggressive ""NO DRAMA ZONE"" turning out to mean that the user is merely trying to keep any offended or genuinely upset comments away from their page because they simply have no idea how to emotionally handle hurting someone's feelings.   Randall previously demonstrated another theoretical feature to address passive-aggressive behavior in 1085: ContextBot.  The comic's feature may be based on the context menu option of the Google Chrome web browser to have a foreign language webpage translated to the user's selected native language. However, in Google Chrome, the user may only translate the entire page, while in this comic the user may also select some text and have only the selected part translated. Also, Google Chrome uses Google Translate for translation by default, which cannot read minds like in the comic.[citation needed] However, if one uses the official Google Translate extension for Google Chrome, one may actually translate only the selected text. It is possible then that it is instead the extension which inspired the comic's feature.  This comic not only illustrates such a feature, but implies that the ""translated"" thoughts are what's actually going on behind posts of these types on social media, as if Randall can actually read those people's minds somehow. If this implication is the intent of the comic, then Randall thinks that people who have ""no filter"" are actually insecure and that people who want ""NO DRAMA"" are actually afraid of upset comments. Alternatively, Randall hates people who post such things in their profiles, and therefore wants to belittle them in this comic as actually being insecure, rather than being as confident as their aggressive behavior implies. This explanation is corroborated by notable news near the comic's publishing time (see below).  The style of the profile showcased in the comic resembles the profiles of the popular social media website Twitter, which while the user is logged in, shows the user's own profile on the left side of the page in a similar style to the comic, with their picture on the left side of their name, their Twitter handle under their name (which explains the extra line of text under what is presumably the name) and their ""bio"" right below those. The Twitter ""bio"" is a space usually used for the user to explain who they are. Common details about a person which are included in their ""bio"" are their profession, their personal interests and the products they have for sale. Some people also write about their personality, such as the one in the comic, which is quite outspoken and frank about her opinions.  One notable news item regarding Twitter, near the comic's publishing time, is that a rogue employee of the Twitter company, on the last day of his job, banned the personal Twitter profile of U.S. President Donald Trump (it was undone 11 minutes later). While Donald Trump never wrote something similar to what the comic portrays on his Twitter profile, he is known to post ""politically incorrect"" statements there. Donald Trump does not seem to care about who those statements offend, just like the person in the comic. Randall is known to have supported the opposing candidate before he was elected, having made a comic just to promote her, and particularly sad comics following his election. These events may have inspired the comic.  The title of this comic is ""Defensive Profile"". ""Defensive"" is the opposite of ""offensive"", which is a word that might be used to describe the contents of profiles which display such a warning as in the comic. However, the feature reveals the warnings to actually be defenses against behaviors that deeply bother the profile owner. The profile is thus proved to actually be ""defensive"" instead of ""offensive"", at least regarding the warning text.","[A profile on an unknown social media site is displayed.

1914: Twitter Verification,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1914:_Twitter_Verification,internet,"When we started distributing special status tokens that signify which people are important enough to join an elite group, we never could have imagined we might be creating some problems down the line.","Some Twitter users (such as Coldplay, or Donald Trump) have a verification checkmark next to their name.  This checkmark is used to indicate that the user is who they say they are, rather than being a fake account made by someone else using their picture and name. This helps fans find the real accounts of their favorite celebrities. However, since the most notable people benefit from this the most, there is some ambiguity in the granting of the verified mark, as it also seems to be interpreted as a status symbol to indicate the notable celebrities. Some even see this as Twitter actively endorsing the user. For this reason, Twitter has removed verified checkmarks from real accounts of celebrities because of political controversies in the past. Examples of this are political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos (before he was banned from the service). One recent controversial decision regarding the verified mark is that Twitter gave a verification checkmark to Jason Kessler, the organizer of a recent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.  This drew attention to Twitter's verification system, so they temporarily suspended it.  The alt-text comments on the lack of foresight on Twitter's part when implementing the verified system: as it by design separates users between an in-group and an out-group, it seems to imply endorsement or, at least, favors some users to the detriment of others. This in turn automatically creates the twin sets of ""people who shouldn't have been verified, but were"" and ""people who deserve to have been verified, but weren't."" As the internet is populated by various large and strongly opinionated groups [citation not needed], neither set will ever be empty and Twitter will always be seen as either endorsing unworthy or snubbing worthy people.  The last line of dialogue is likely a pun on the Twitter Moments feature, which can be used to compile several tweets with a shared theme into a browsable gallery. The character depicted is the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, judging by the beard.","[A bearded figure, depicting the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is standing behind a podium with the blue Twitter bird logo.] Jack: Everyone calm down— Jack: We just need to go figure out how to bestow a global in-or-out status badge on some people, at our discretion, without anyone reading anything into who gets one.  Jack: This should only take a moment."
185: Wikifriends,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/185:_Wikifriends,internet,"It's crazy how much my gut opinion of a movie/song is swayed by what other people say, regardless of how I felt coming out of the theater.","The comic's title refers  Wikis, which are collaboratively edited websites. The first such site was WikiWikiWeb, but Wikipedia (an online encyclopedia) has become the most well-known example, and may have been specifically what Randall had in mind, as other comics do reference Wikipedia.  The influence of social environment is called peer pressure, often with a negative connotation. The term ""Wikifriends"" is coined in the comic as a label for people who adjust their views in order to incorporate into a group. That is to say that, in the same way a Wiki page can be edited by people other than the original author, a ""Wikifriend"" allows their opinions to be ""edited"" by someone else. As an example, the comic shows a discussion about a movie in which one collocutor entirely veers in his opinion when he hears what his friend thinks.  The title text suggests that Randall also observes himself to be frequently influenced by others.",WikiFriends: [Two people are talking to each other.] Cueball: I really liked that movie. Friend: I hated that movie. Cueball: Me too.
214: The Problem with Wikipedia,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/214:_The_Problem_with_Wikipedia,internet,Taft in a wet t-shirt contest' is the key image here.,"This comic illustrates the ""problems"" of information explosion coupled with a dense web of hypertext links. Through most of human history, written media has been both slow and linear. Hypertext allows a new type of information consumption, through small chunks of information linked together in a web of related concepts, and by being digital, each new chunk can be retrieved quickly and effortlessly. Wikipedia applies this principle very strongly, and because it covers so many topics, it is common for a reader to skim an article about a topic they need or want to know about, and end up following a series of links out of curiosity. Since each new page also has several links, the overall navigation pattern resembles a tree that branches out, ""exploding"" in size with each new level of link-clicking, thus resulting in many wasted hours (over three in this case) of reading stuff unrelated to the original goal, and lots of open browser tabs holding a wide variety of articles, which are seemingly unrelated, but have common ""ancestors."" (The problem, for Randall, of wasting time on Wikipedia was later referenced in the title text of 1501: Mysteries, and the more general problem of getting trapped following a never-ending chain of interesting links was covered in 609: Tab Explosion.) The large diversity in end links may also be a reference to the Wikipedia game.  One can also see this effect occur in other MediaWiki-powered wikis such as this very website, where one comic can lead to another of similar relation or category. In the table below, a possible route for each entry has been found.  Finding routes between the start and end points of the two pages above and the six below makes good challenges in the Wikipedia game.  The title text refers to two of the articles that were supposedly reached at the bottom. William Howard Taft was the 27th President of the U.S., in office from 1909 to 1913, who was notorious for being so overweight that he became stuck in the White House bathtub. A wet T-shirt contest is an exhibitionistic competition typically featuring young women contestants at a nightclub, bar, or resort. Clearly the combination of these two would be rather bizarre.  There is an online game that involves trying to get from one Wikipedia page to another in the shortest possible route: http://thewikigame.com/.  Due to the ever changing nature of Wikipedia, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge entry on Wikipedia no longer links to Structural collapse, requiring an intermediate step via Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940), and since Structural collapse now redirects to Structural integrity and failure, most pages on Wikipedia that linked to Structural collapse have been changed to rename this link.","[Heading above the chart:] The Problem with Wikipedia: [Text in a frame below the heading:] Tacoma Narrows Bridge [Lines lead down both left and right to two new frames with the following text:]  Suspension bridge  Structural collapse [Two more lines lead down from the left frame and one from the right frame, and each line ends on a wiggling line.

265: Choices: Part 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/265:_Choices:_Part_2,internet,"Maybe someday I'll get to write the Wikipedia article about this place! Wait, damn, original research.","The ""Choices"" series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday). It explores and marvels at human freedom. This is, however, a little sidetrack from the ""Choices"" narrative. Cueball is studying special relativity. The speed of light in a vacuum (299,792,458 m/s) is denoted as c. Megan and the spaceship are shown traveling at 0.2c in opposite directions. This would mean (in Newtonian mechanics) 0.4c relative to each other. But due to relativistic effects, their velocities do not simply add when the spaceship observes Megan; in reality, both would measure only 0.385c ( = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c2) ) from the other's point of view. Also, time dilation influences the way time is observed with reference to the two frames of reference. Megan, however, has other concerns. (This text and part of the image were completely reused in the space part of the interactive 1350: Lorenz (see image here).  In the title text, Megan thinks about writing about this after-worldly place in Wikipedia, but then realizes that the content would be removed, due to the Wikipedia policy on original research. Even though her claims would be true, she would need reliable written sources to support them.  All parts of ""Choices"":  As this was the second in the series, it was released on a Tuesday.","[Cueball is doing some exercises in a book.

285: Wikipedian Protester,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester,internet,SEMI-PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION,"Cueball holds up a sign reading ""Citation Needed"" during a political speech. The sign text is based on the Wikipedia template that can be placed next to statements that need citations, usually because of questionable validity. Cueball is using this template to challenge the politician's speech.  The title text below the comic references semi-protection, a protection measure typical of Wikipedia, which basically protects some articles from being edited anonymously. Constitutional amendments cannot usually be proposed anonymously, meaning that in effect, all articles of constitution are semi-protected.","[There is a politician speaking at a podium, which sports an American flag.] [In front of the speaker there is a crowd of people listening. In the middle of the crowd a man is standing up holding a sign reading ""[CITATION NEEDED]"" in blue underlined text, as in Wikipedia articles.]"
333: Getting Out of Hand,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/333:_Getting_Out_of_Hand,internet,"Wikipedia's role as brain-extension, while a little troubling, is also really cool.","Given how Wikipedia has an ever-expanding variety of topics, the grand majority of them in great detail, there is a possibility (even a temptation) of relying on Wikipedia to learn from every topic that leaves you confused... even foreplay. ('Bedtime' and 'us time' is not necessarily 'computer time'.)  This comic may also be a reference to how people can get addicted to reading Wikipedia pages, because there are many interesting links on each page that people haven't read yet, and there are links on that page that they click on, etc. This may be the reason that Cueball is reading Wikipedia instead of sleeping with Megan, because he got stuck in the link loop.  The title text refers to the fact that many rely on Wikipedia instead of remembering/learning stuff. This was later directly addressed as the subject of 903: Extended Mind","[A couple is in bed in the dark, and Cueball reaches out from under the covers to do a Wikipedia search about Foreplay.]"
444: Macgyver Gets Lazy,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/444:_Macgyver_Gets_Lazy,internet,"At the time of this writing, Wikipedia has a wonderful article titled 'List of problems solved by Macgyver'","MacGyver was a 80s and early 90s TV character, famed for improvising complex devices in a matter of minutes in order to escape dangerous situations. In this comic MacGyver suggests an unusually direct plan—shooting the guard in the head. However, he still manages to describe his plan in a rather 'complex' manner.  It is worth noting that in the show, MacGyver was adamantly against the use of guns and never used one (at least, not for its intended purpose) in the entire run of the old series.  A MacGyver reboot was made in 2016, and was not well received (38% on Metacritic, 4.6/10 in iMDb). It has only one season so far.  The Wikipedia page referenced by the title text redirects to the main MacGyver entry since September 2012. The Wikipedia page can still be found in history, and the content has been moved to MacGyver wikia and expanded.","[Outside of a building with a door marked No Entry and a guard standing outside, Cueball and MacGyver are hiding.] Cueball: Any ideas?

446: In Popular Culture,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/446:_In_Popular_Culture,internet,"Someday, the 'in popular culture' section will have its own article with an 'in popular culture' section. It will reference this title-text referencing it, and the blogosphere will implode.","Wikipedia is a popular online encyclopedia with articles that are created and edited by the general public [citation required] . Wikipedia entries have many sections, with the first few explaining the general concept and details behind the subject.  When this comic was written many Wikipedia articles had a section at the end entitled ""in popular culture"", listing TV shows, movies, songs and so on which made reference to the subject at hand. In many cases, this list was extensive, possibly because the people editing the articles were such fans of the subject or the pop culture in which it is referenced, they couldn't help but go into great detail, listing many esoteric and seemingly irrelevant elements of pop culture which were peripherally related to the subject of the article. As an example, see the old article Apollo in popular culture which as of August 2007 redirects to Apollo.  The joke in this case is that even such a mundane article such as one on wood could have an ""in popular culture"" section and obviously, wooden items are common enough that there are any number of instances of popular culture which could be considered to ""reference it"", even if that's something as basic as a wooden item being used as a prop in a TV show. Such information would be of little or no use to anybody and only somebody obsessed with wood, a particular element of pop culture in which wood makes an appearance or the concept of placing pop culture references in encyclopedia articles would bother to create or maintain such a section.  Also, wood being such a popular material, the list of references could be virtually endless. This is a reference to the fact that the ""in popular culture"" sections of many Wikipedia articles contained dozens of items, even for articles on fairly arcane subjects. Note that the end of this particular ""in popular culture"" section is not visible so we don't know how long it is.  The title text states that in the future there will even have to be a wiki page with the subject ""In popular culture"". This article will also need an ""in popular culture"" section and it will be obvious to make a reference directly to this title text, as xkcd is part of popular culture and because this title text predicted the creation of and need for such a page. However this would then create a circular reference. This could be considered a form of infinite loop which is one way to cause a computer to crash (lock up). The joke is that the blogosphere could follow this endless train of circular links and itself crash, causing an ""implosion"".  This comic was mentioned in Wikipedia:""In popular culture"" content. However, on April 23, 2014, the reference was edited out. It has since been added under the external links section of Wikipedia:xkcd in popular culture.  The reference was added back in May 2015.","[A fictional screen capture of the Wikipedia article for ""wood"" is shown.

545: Neutrality Schmeutrality,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/545:_Neutrality_Schmeutrality,internet,"Hey, everyone, you can totally trust that I didn't do a word count on MY edit!'","Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia with content developed and submitted by volunteers around the world. In fact, its slogan is ""Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit."" Most articles on the site can be altered by anyone with access to Wikipedia.  Wikipedia has set some standards for its operation, which it refers to as the ""Five pillars of Wikipedia"". One of these pillars is titled ""Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view.""  Pro-life and pro-choice refer to two opposing viewpoints in the debate of the moral and legal rights concerning abortion. For many on both sides, it is a very emotional topic.  Black Hat has decided to prove that you can create an article which fundamentally cannot remain neutral. Since his charitable donation is determined by the word count of the article, any submission to Wikipedia must result in supporting either pro-life or pro-choice. And with a reward of one million dollars, it is unlikely that either side would allow an article to remain unedited which supported its opponent.  The title of the comic references an old (read, ""pre-Internet"") meme, possibly of Yiddish origin, known as shm-reduplication. The speaker replaces the initial consonant cluster (have it 0, 1 or even 2+ consonants) with the cluster ""schm"", read /ʃm/, and says the new word after the unadulterated word, as in the title where it is ""N"" that has been replaced. This denotes an active apathy or an intentional disregard of the authority (for it is usually an authority or someone in a similar position) being mocked. In this case, Black Hat is disregarding Wikipedia's neutrality doctrine with his word count dependent donation rule.  The title text is a statement from the Wikipedia author in an attempt to assert the neutrality of the submission, claiming no word count was performed before posting (an unlikely scenario).","[Above the frame:] Trivia: It's possible to create events which Wikipedia cannot cover neutrally [Black Hat is at a press conference in which he is making an announcement in front of a large crowd mainly of Cueballs but also some Megans.] Black Hat: In a week, I will be donating $1,000,000 to a recipient determined by the word count of the Wikipedia article about this event. If it's even, the money goes to pro-choice activists. If it's odd, pro-life."
547: Simple,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/547:_Simple,internet,"Actually, I think if all higher math professors had to write for the Simple English Wikipedia for a year, we'd be in much better shape academically.","There are three Cueballs discussing a particle accelerator. One Cueball asks the others about the ""tertiary Free-electron laser (F.E.L) guidance system"". As this is a fairly technical topic, we would expect a response filled with scientific jargon. The joke is that the other Cueball instead responds in a much simpler manner. He uses simple phrases such as ""smash the right things together"" and ""that would be very bad"".  As the caption below the comic notes, Cueball and/or Randall has spent the previous night reading the Simple English Wikipedia, a simplified version of Wikipedia intended to be easier to understand, and now he finds himself using similarly simple syntax. For example, the article for a particle accelerator describes it as ""a machine that makes really tiny things called particles travel at very high speeds."" This is similar to the simple response given by the responding Cueball. In the actual comic, Cueball was able to effectively communicate the dangers of using a broken F.E.L. using simple syntax similar to the style of the Simple English Wikipedia.  From the title text, Randall believes that if people teaching advanced mathematics followed this style, their subject would be more accessible. The implication is that more people would be drawn to studying mathematics and that (naturally) the world would be a better place because of this!  This concept was later revisited in 722: Computer Problems, 1133: Up Goer Five, (possibly most notably) Thing Explainer, and 1436: Orb Hammer.","[Three Cueball-like guys stand in front of a sketch. The middle Cueball is the protagonist of the comic and will be called Cueball.] Left Cueball-like guy: Do you have any thoughts regarding the particle accelerator's tertiary F.E.L. Guidance System?

It is revealed that instead of taking these photos at home or in a professional studio, they are shooting at a TGI Friday's restaurant.  TGI Friday's is an American multinational restaurant chain known for its casual family-friendly atmosphere, upbeat service, and fried appetizers. Megan's and Cueball's behaviour is of course highly inappropriate, due to the sanitation issues relating to sitting or laying naked on the tables, as well as public decency issues; nudity is illegal in most public places, and this is compounded by the fact that there are usually children in TGI Friday's. It is likely that the erection plate, is supposed to refer to a fear erection, created as a result of greater blood pumping from adrenaline  The message implicit in the comic (and stated outright in the title text) is that careful cropping can produce useful, apparently professional reference images, even if the source photograph was not taken in a professional manner, or was pornographic in nature.","Plate 15: Female breast [There is a drawing of a breast, with 'breast', 'areola', and 'nipple' labeled.]  Plate 16: External female genitalia [There is a picture of external female genitalia.

682: Force,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/682:_Force,internet,Force-choking the chicken.,"This comic features Darth Vader, the main antagonist from the original Star Wars trilogy.   Autoerotic asphyxiation is a sexual practice in which lack of oxygen is induced to enhance sexual stimulus. The technique is considered extremely dangerous, especially without supervision, as loss of consciousness can result in continued strangling which can quickly be fatal.  In the films, Vader possesses the ability to restrict the airway of an opponent without having to touch them, using only the so-called ""force"". This practise has therefore been called force-choking. The comic assumes that Vader used this technique against himself, with the help of a mirror, in order to become sexually aroused.  Lord Vader has apparently force-choked himself to the point of unconsciousness (or possibly even death) and is being transported from his house on a stretcher by two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).  The title text is a pun on the term ""choking the chicken"", a colloquial expression referring to male masturbation. ""Force-choking the chicken"" might mean a technique of self-gratification by use of the ""force"" without having to apply one's hands.",[Two EMTs are rushing Darth Vader away from a front door on a stretcher.]  [There is a room with a desk in the foreground and a full-length mirror in the corner.

739: Malamanteau,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/739:_Malamanteau,internet,"The article has twenty-three citations, one of which is an obscure manuscript from the 1490s and the other twenty-two are arguments on LanguageLog.","A malapropism is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical utterance.  An example of a malapropism is Yogi Berra's statement: ""Texas has a lot of electrical votes,"" rather than ""electoral votes"". A portmanteau is a word made-up of two or more combined words and their definitions. For example, motel is a portmanteau, from the words motor and hotel. A neologism is simply a newly coined word that is not yet in common use.   Here, Randall shows a hypothetical Wikipedia page of the word ""malamanteau"" which is both a portmanteau of ""malapropism"" and ""portmanteau"" and a malapropism of ""portmanteau"". Finally, ""malamanteau"" is itself a neologism because Randall invented the word when he wrote this comic. The methods used to create this new word are the very words used in the process. This is called a meta or ""self-referential"" joke.  ""Malamanteau"" was originally coined in 2007, when it was proposed by user ludwig_van on Metafilter as a term for language errors like ""flustrated"" (flustered & frustrated) and ""misconscrewed"" (misconstrued & screwed).   The bottom line of the comic (Ever notice how Wikipedia has a few words it really likes?) is a reference to the large number of Wikipedia pages that start by labeling their subject matter as a malapropism, a portmanteau, or a neologism.   In response to this comic, editors at Wikipedia created a malamanteau page. It was deleted multiple times and eventually turned into a redirect to the Wikipedia page for xkcd. Malamanteau and the controversy at Wikipedia got coverage at The Economist and The Boston Globe.  The title text refers to Wikipedia's requirements of citations for a page on there to exist. It also refers to the wide range of places citations can be obtained from, showing a direct opposition due to the use of very different citations (The Language Log arguments are modern and informal, whereas the obscure manuscript is formal and much older). Language Log is a blog that posts content relating to language and linguistics, including things like malapropisms and portmanteaus. While an informal source, it has produced new linguistic terms before, such as eggcorn. Its comments sections frequently contain discussions and arguments about English, whose participants are probably the same people who write Wikipedia articles about linguistic phenomena like malamanteaux. The fact that no modern citation could be found outside of Language Log comments implies that the malamanteau is not a widely recognized or studied concept, but one invented by amateur linguists. Malamanteau did not appear on Language Log until after this strip. Malamanteau has since been referenced on the Language Log website, with a link to the comic in question. Language Log has referenced XKCD many times before, reposting the comics and linking to the XKCD website.  The citation of a document from the 1490s is a reference to the fact that linguists, like those who post on Language Log, often use old documents as evidence, possibly to prove that a construction is a longstanding feature of the language. However, if such an archaic citation is the only evidence of the term's use, then it is unlikely to be a notable feature worthy of a Wikipedia article.  Further, the title text implies that the fictional article isn't exactly the most stable inside the fictional Wikipedia's userbase, or otherwise is being subject to some severe favoritism, since ""malamanteau"" hasn't been used at any time since the feudal ages and its most recent citations are a borderline flame war on another website. Most articles that are only cited by a single website tend to get deleted unless the subject has achieved significant coverage in outside news media.","[The strip is set up as the top of a Wikipedia page.] [The Wikipedia logo.] Wikipedia The free encyclopedia [Side navigation options.] Navigation -Main Page -Contents -Featured Content -Current Events [Wikipedia header options.] Article  Discussion  Edit this page  History [The article itself.] Malamanteau From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A malamanteau is a neologism for a portmanteau created by incorrectly combining a malapropism with a neologism.

People went around saying glass was a slow-flowing liquid. You folks these days don't know how good you have it.""","The Wikipedia article List of common misconceptions gives a list of commonly-repeated anecdotes that are widely believed to be true, but actually are not.   The teacher, Miss Lenhart, is announcing that since it is the first Tuesday in February, by law and custom the reading of this article is requirement to stem the repetition of these incorrect anecdotes. (Funnily enough the comic was released the first Wednesday in January, which could just as well have been written in the comic).  She continues to make it clear that this is to make the students in general a little less wrong, and the main outcome will be that the guest of any future parties the students ever attend, will not have to listen to them retell these misconceptions and for that these guest will thank those who have decided on this new law in advance.  In the caption below the comic Randall expresses his wishes that he lived in a parallel universe where this rule had been used for many years. So he would not have to listen to all these stories at every party he goes to. Since Randall likes to correct people if they are wrong (see 386: Duty Calls), not having to discuss with those that believe these misconceptions, would make his parties much better.  The title text refers to a specific one of these false stories about glass:   In reality, older manufacturing processes did not produce glass panes with as uniform thickness as modern processes, and people tended to install the uneven panes with the thicker side at the bottom for stability. Glass simply does not flow at room temperature; it's more viscous than solid lead by a factor of over a billion. The fact that glass is solid at room temperature was again referenced in a foot note, under the pipe with glass, in 1649: Pipelines.  It seems that Miss Lenhart has taken the right course from 803: Airfoil as she there thought another common misconception.","[Miss Lenhart the teacher is standing in front of a board, looking at a laptop computer she is holding in one hand while elocuting.] Miss Lenhart: Okay, middle school students, it's the first Tuesday in February.

899: Number Line,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/899:_Number_Line,internet,"The Wikipedia page List of Numbers opens with ""This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.""","Once again, Randall seems to be just messing around, this time with a number line.  The title text is a literalism joke, implying that Wikipedia would like its ""List of numbers"" page to include every number from negative infinity to infinity. It could also be a reference to Gödel's incompleteness theorems, which Randall has used as comic fodder before in 468: Fetishes. Gödel's theorems roughly assert that a number theory could never be fully complete. The equivalent for a list of numbers is Cantor's diagonal argument, which is a proof that any list of real numbers can never be complete even if the list is infinitely long. Either way, any ""true"" Wikipedia article named ""List of numbers"" would perforce forever be incomplete, no matter how much it was expanded. Both Gödel's incompleteness theorems and Cantor's diagonal argument feature prominently in Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter, to whom Randall devoted later comic 917: Hofstadter. It may also be referencing his previous statements about Wikipedia being the home of compulsive list-makers, who make the most astonishingly complete lists imaginable.","[Number line ranging from -1 to 10.] [Arrow pointing left, towards negative numbers] Negative ""imitator"" numbers (do not use) [Line right before the number one] 0.99...

906: Advertising Discovery,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/906:_Advertising_Discovery,internet,"When advertisers figure this out, our only weapon will be blue sharpies and ""[disputed]"".","On Wikipedia, a well-referenced text or statement indicates credibility. References for particular facts are linked to by bracketed blue little numbers in superscript.[1][3][4] When faced with a statement followed by these, readers will normally believe it without further ado,[6][10] since they take it on trust that there are directions on the bottom of the page, leading to a reliable source or two, agreeing with what the statement says. The effect becomes strengthened when such information often is confirmed to be correct.  In the comic, advertisers have realized that it has gone so far that people in general will take any nonsense for granted if there is just the right amount of Wikipedia-style reference tags to it. The penis pump e-commerce can suddenly flourish (again?) and the spammers won't even need to bother making up findings to cite.  Turgidax® is something Randall formed from turgid, meaning swollen. One reason that the attaching of -ax creates a typically pill-like name is simply that -ax (and -ex) are common Latin adjectival word endings, and that many drugs have names formed from Latin words. -Ax is also, specifically, the root of the -acious ending in English, as in ""audacious"" or (appropriately) bodacious, meaning ""extra"" or ""especially"". The idea is it makes the genitalius extra or especially turgid. Cardiovascular means relating to the heart and blood vessels.   The title text is about how Wikipedia users have been able to add ""disputed""-tags (nowadays ""disputed – discuss"") after challenged facts, with this template, since the dawn of time.[11][disputed – discuss] So when faced with the new advertising trick IRL, we could counter by scribbling those tags all over with blue Sharpie marker pens, and so automatically revive the critical thinking.","Advertising discovery: [Person sits at computer, reading an ad on the screen.

911: Magic School Bus,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/911:_Magic_School_Bus,internet,"At my OLD school, we used Microsoft Encarta 2005.","The Magic School Bus is a series of educational children's books in the US that was adapted in the mid-nineties into an animated television show. The series centers on a class of children whose teacher Ms. Frizzle makes use of the titular magic school bus to take her students on a variety of magical field trips that allow them to experience various scientific topics first hand, such as the inner anatomy of the human body, the effects of friction, what goes on inside a beehive, and many others.  In this comic, however, Ms. Frizzle initially takes the students onto the bus apparently for one of these field trips to explore the way batteries work, but then for whatever reason, she has the students get off the bus again and simply resorts to looking up the Wikipedia article about batteries. The implied joke is that, with the advent on resources like Wikipedia, it's no longer necessary for Ms. Frizzle to take the students on half-hour long trips in the bus to experience whatever phenomenon they are studying that day (which is what the third panel symbolizes) - Wikipedia effectively answers the question quickly and easily. An alternative answer is that Ms. Frizzle has just gotten lazy, and has resorted to looking up the answers to the students' questions on Wikipedia instead of taking them on field trips. The alternative seems more likely, since the third panel shows them still going on an adventure, however briefly it takes to get to the library/computer lab.  The red and white cubed rocket in the bottom of the third panel can possibly be a reference to The Adventures of Tintin, in which Tintin goes to the moon in a rocket that is similar, if not identical, to the one depicted.  The child who is asking the question looks similar to Wanda, one of the regular students in the class who often asked the questions that set the field trips in motion. Ralphie, the student in the second panel with the backward hat, was another student who often asked these questions. The students in the class were shown to be from many backgrounds (i.e. some of the students were black, another was Asian, etc.), something Randall appears not to have added into this comic, despite it being in color.  The title text is a reference to Phoebe, one of the students in Ms. Frizzle's class, who would regularly make a remark beginning with ""At my old school..."" (Phoebe used to go to a different school, unlike many of the other students in the class) to express wonder at how unusual were the events of Ms. Frizzle's field trips (e.g. ""At my old school, we never rode on bees!""). Phoebe actually said that so much that in an episode where she goes back to her old school, the sign out front labels it as ""Phoebe's old school"".  Microsoft Encarta 2005 was a digital encyclopedia that was often used in school settings for learning with the aid of computers. Arguably, with the advent of Wikipedia, programs like Encarta have become relatively less widely used, which is part of the joke in the title text.","[A girl sits at a desk in a classroom, and the teacher stands before her. The teacher has a blue dress and blonde hair piled on her head in a bun.

915: Connoisseur,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/915:_Connoisseur,internet,"Our brains have just one scale, and we resize our experiences to fit.","White Hat is fond of good wine, and he can probably distinguish slight differences in different types of wine, perhaps being the type that attends wine tasting parties. He doesn't like the cheap wine that Cueball has served for him (implying a cheap wine cannot be a good one, a statement most wine enthusiasts passionately agree with), looking with disgust at the label of the offending bottle.   On the other hand, Cueball doesn't have a preference; all of them taste the same for him, so presumably he gets the cheaper ones. White Hat tells Cueball that if he just tried some really good wine and paid more attention he would discover a whole new world.  Cueball's answer is the main message of the comic. He says that wine is no different from anything else in this respect, and makes a list starting with the wine but then going past house music, fonts, ants, Wikipedia signatures ending up with Canadian surrealist porn (Comic 1051 reference). His point is that if you spend enough time focusing one special type of subjects/taste/visual challenges, then you'll become a snobby connoisseur of that topic.   White Hat tries to defend wine by saying that some things have more depth than others (wine being among them), but Cueball challenges him on this by choosing something as obscure as 500 pictures of Joe Biden, the famously gaffe prone Vice President of the United States alongside Barack Obama, eating a sandwich as an example. He claims that if people are locked up in a box with those pictures for a year, they would end up being connoisseur on that subject with the same vehemence regarding the best picture as wine tasters can be about the best wine.  White Hat claims that this is an exaggeration, but Cueball takes this as a challenge so in the last panel, apparently White Hat and Cueball are actually running this experiment to see if they will end up concentrating on slight differences among the placement of mayonnaise on the pictures of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, just in the same way that White Hat concentrates on slight differences among kinds of wine. The result of the experiment is clearly going to Cueball's side, the discussion mainly going on the importance of mayo or the light through lettuce from the sandwiches.  This mentality may also be applied to online groups based on certain subjects (such as television shows, films, and other hobbies and interests), where arguments and vehement, stubborn opinions are common despite the fairly unimportant subject.   The title text presents the same idea in a different wording. The ""scale of our brains"" refers to a concept similar to Richard Dawkins' Middle World, where things too small (say, smaller than the point of a pin) or too big (bigger than what we can see from a mountaintop) are just out of our comprehension, so the things our brains understand must be neither too small nor too big, i.e. the ""middle world"".  However, the title text goes further in this idea: When we find things too big (like the distance to the Moon), we shrink it so that it fits into the ""middle world"" we're used to. Conversely, when we find things too small (say, a mote of dust), we expand it for the same reason. In a quite similar way, if all we have is pictures of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, we ""resize"" that subject so that we can fill books with the details about the pictures.  Specialized interests and the people involved in them are used again, with ants being the subject of 1610: Fire Ants,  typefaces in 590: Papyrus and 736: Cemetery, plastic straws in 1095: Crazy Straws and porn-video quality in 598: Porn.  In 1534: Beer, Cueball also argue slight differences in alcohol brands don't make much difference (in 915 ""Wine all tastes the same to me.""; in 1534, ""maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?"") and people just pretend due to social pressure.","[White Hat is holding a wine glass down in one hand and holding a bottle of wine up in front of him with the other hand. He is looking at the label and talking with Cueball standing next to him with his own filled wine glass in one hand. He is looking down at the glass.] White Hat: How do you stand this cheap wine? Cueball: Wine all tastes the same to me.  [Close-up of White Hat.] White Hat: You've just never had good wine. If you paid more attention, you'd realize there's a whole world here.  [Close-up on Cueball, who spreads his arms out, resulting in the wine in the glass sloshing so much that part of the wine is above the rim of the glass, some even hanging over the edge and a spray droplet hanging above the sloshing liquid.] Cueball: But that's true of anything!

White Hat now has both glass and bottle held down at his side. Cueball holds his glass down, but tilted away from him.

Cueball: If you locked people in a box for a year with 500 still frames of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, by the end they'd be adamant that some were great and some were terrible. White Hat: You're exaggerating. Cueball: Oh, really?  [This panel is below the feet of the two characters from the previous panel. It goes further to the left than those two, and is wider than the previous panels, but it does not go much past the middle, so there is a blank white space to the left of this panel, below the first and most of the second panel. It shows a box, with two star burst on the surface from where two voices emanate from the inside. Over the top left of the panels frame is a small frame with a caption:] A year later: Voice (from left side of the box): Sure, most closed-mouth frames are boring, but in #415, the way the man's jaw frames the mayo on his hand is pure perfection, and— Voice (from right side of the box): What a surprise- you praising a mayo frame. Listening to you, I'd think there was nothing else in The Sandwich.  Voice (from right side of the box): Frankly, the light hitting J.B.'s collar through the lettuce would put #242 in my top ten even if he had no mayo on his hand at all."
978: Citogenesis,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/978:_Citogenesis,internet,"I just read a pop-science book by a respected author. One chapter, and much of the thesis, was based around wildly inaccurate data which traced back to... Wikipedia. To encourage people to be on their toes, I'm not going to say what book or author.","This comic is calling into question the reliability of Wikipedia. This is a favorite pastime of librarians and professional researchers, and not usually one of Randall's. But, to take it seriously for a moment: People, Wikipedia is editable by anyone. If you are doing serious work, follow through the citations, and decide which are from upstanding sources, and which are just people writing on their blog, and which are people writing on their blog who know what they are talking about.  The title of the comic is a play on the word cytogenesis. Cytogenesis is the formation of cells and their development. Citogenesis, on the other hand is a portmanteau of 'Citation' and 'Genesis'. A Citation is a reference to a source, used to back up a specific claim. Genesis means the origin of something.  By extension, citogenesis is the creation of text in a reliable source that can be cited to back-up a claim.  The comic is discussing citogenesis occurring on Wikipedia, a free and freely editable encyclopedia that aims to become a comprehensive, neutral compilation of verifiable, established facts.  Wikipedia aims to provide only facts backed by reliable sources. However, this comic strip details a process in which Wikipedia can not only spread misinformation, but make said misinformation seem reliable through a process of ""circular reporting"".  In this distorted process, someone adds an untrue claim to an article in Wikipedia. A writer of some supposedly ""reliable source"" checks Wikipedia for information, and blindly relies on it, without checking for proper sources. Eventually, someone notices the claim in the reliable source, and cites it in the Wikipedia article. The citation then lends further credence to the claim in Wikipedia, so the claim is more likely to be used by other reliable sources, generating a positive-feedback loop.  Four years before, Randall commented on Wikipedia about that process happening to him (on a minor detail), which probably indicates the inception of this comic:  In turn, Randall originated the untrue assertion in this comic that Steven Chu, a physicist, and at the time of the strip the U.S. Secretary of Energy, invented the Scroll lock key, a common button on computer keyboards. Since most people are aware of the scroll lock key but know little about its function or origins, this false information would make for an interesting piece of trivia that would likely spread very quickly.      Following this comic, the actual Scroll lock and Steven Chu articles were both vandalized by ""helpful"" editors trying to project Randall's reality on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia article on Citogenesis redirects to the information loop section on the article ""Reliability of Wikipedia"".  That section ends with crediting the term ""citogenesis"" to ""webcomic artist Randall Munroe"", with a link to this comic. This now has three citations. To make matters even more surreal, some Wikipedia editor once flagged the link to this xkcd comic as ""Dubious - The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or non-factual.""!  We haven't seen a book like the one Randall describes in the title text.  But one example of the misuse of Wikipedia by ""reliable sources"" concerns the former German minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. His complete name contains fifteen names/words and reads: Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg. An anonymous user added one more (""Wilhelm"") to the German Wikipedia, just the evening before Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was presented as the new Federal Minister of Economics and Technology on February 10, 2009. The next day many major German newspapers published this wrong name (translation of bildblog.de).","Where Citations Come From: Citogenesis Step #1 Through a convoluted process, a user's brain generates facts. These are typed into Wikipedia. [A guy with short hair sits at a desk, typing on a laptop.] Guy: (typing) The ""scroll lock"" key was was designed by future Energy Secretary Steven Chu in a college project.  A rushed writer checks Wikipedia for a summary of their subject. [Ponytail sits at a desk, typing on a desktop.] Ponytail: (typing) US Energy Secretary Steven Chu, (Nobel Prizewinner and creator of the ubiquitous ""scroll lock"" key) testified before Congress today... Step #2  Surprised readers check Wikipedia, see the claim, and flag it for review. A passing editor finds the piece and adds it as a citation. [Cueball sits on a couch with a laptop in his lap, typing.] Cueball: Google is your friend, people. (typing) <ref>{{cite web|url= Step #3  Step #4 Now that other writers have a real source, they repeat the fact. [A flow chart, with ""Wikipedia citation"" in the center. The word ""Wikipedia"" is in black, the word ""citations"" is white with a red background. A black arrow leads from ""brain"" to ""Wikipedia."" A black arrow labeled ""words"" leads from ""Wikipedia"" to ""careless writers,"" and a red arrow labeled ""citations"" leads back to ""Wikipedia citations."" A black & red arrow leads from ""Wikipedia"" to ""cited facts"" which leads to ""slightly more careful writers,"" which leads to ""more citations,"" which leads back to :""Wikipedia"" (all black & red arrows).] References proliferate, completing the citogenesis process."
980: Money,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/980:_Money,internet,"There, I showed you it.","This is another chart comic - a type of comic that Randall does from time to time. He has for instance done maps of the Internet (twice!) and other huge visualizations like this chart Radiation with a similar structure as this chart but with Radiation as the subject. The Radiation chart is most likely the inspiration for this much more comprehensive Money chart. In the chart there are five boxes with items on different scales of monetary value. Each scale of dollar increments are different colors. One dollar increments are green - naturally, because American paper money is green. Thousands are Orange/Red. Millions are gray. Billions are yellow. Trillions are blue. This comic uses the short scale for naming large numbers (so a billion = 1000 millions = 109 rather than a million millions = 1012 as in continental Europe). Because the comic is so huge and complex the explanation has been split into several parts and also individual pages: Below are five tables with explanation for some of the items. The transcript is (as is usually the case with huge comics) only given for the text that is visible on the picture shown here above. However the full transcript for all the text in the huge image has also been completed. Finally some tables with prices has been made (although they are not yet complete). In the Billions box there is a vague term called the ""Economic Vortex"" as well as arrows that flow between different blocks of this box. This is to show where the money goes. Where it is collected from, and where it is distributed to. Included in one frame is a small man with a red and white striped shirt, blue pants, a cane and a knit cap. He is known as Wally or Waldo (in the US) from the Where's Waldo books. To not give anything away for those who wish to search for him themselves there will be no spoiler here. But if someone needs a little help... Then by clicking this link you will be directed to the relevant section amongst the five sections where Waldo can be found. (The link will take you to that section of the full transcript page). If you still cannot find him (or give up in advance) then just search the transcript page for Wally or Waldo.

In the case of Wikipedia and other wikis powered by MediaWiki, they are blue for non-visited and purple for visited. In this comic, Randall is ashamed of the pages he has visited, because with the color changes there is evidence of what he has visited in the past, e.g. autoerotic asphyxiation (possibly while researching 682: Force, which features that  very Wikipedia page).  Also the pages that he did visit before are in great contrast with the pages that he hasn't. Pages he didn't click are often difficult, highly intelligent topics, while he only clicks the easy, funny articles with little scientific background on the Wikipedia site.  The title text refers to a common mistake many people make when reading articles on Wikipedia. Words referring to subjects that have an article on Wikipedia are coloured in blue. This, however, can cause confusion when two words leading to two separate articles appear together, as the two links appear to be one. However, on hovering the cursor over the article link, only one word at a time is underlined, showing that the links are separate.  It is not possible to determine who this fake article is supposed to be about, but the Macarena band is certainly from Dos Hermanas, Spain. So, it is quite possibly a made up article from Randall.

1079: United Shapes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1079:_United_Shapes,internet,That eggplant is in something of a flaccid state.,"In this comic, each state of the United States of America has been filled-in with an object of similar shape. Due to the size range of the states, some states are too small to clearly make-out in the normal size image. Click here to see the large version, which makes every state perfectly clear. Several years later Randall made a new map of the US mainland 1653: United States Map, where he shuffled the positions of the states but filled out the outline. Also in this map Michigan has been split into two separate parts. (Here it is the glove and the eagle).   Very few, if any, of the shapes used are stereotypes of the state; they are merely objects that look like the state. Some of the objects are those which the states are widely known to resemble. For example, Michigan is represented by a glove and an Eagle, and a pot with handle takes the place of Oklahoma (with the panhandle region of the state filled with a literal handle). Others, however, are more creative. Few would have likely pictured Texas as a dog or Alaska as a bear with a jet pack and laser gun. There are several incredibly simple objects filling some states. Kentucky is filled by a cloud, which conceivably could have been used for any state, and Wyoming, one of the nearly rectangular states, is simply an envelope. There are three pairs of states that are related. Georgia and Missouri each contain an image of the other, drawing attention to their similar shapes, North and South Dakota are the top and bottom halves of an amp, and Alabama and Mississippi are moai facing in opposite directions.)  Colorado contains what looks like a Wikipedia article. A close-up of the fake article is provided [1]. The following references are made in the Colorado article:  New Mexico according to Randall's transcript is ""A liquid container labeled for something of unusual and silly danger"". The labeling is upside down and it refers to the nuclear testing facility White Sands Missile Range located in New Mexico for the nuclear bomb.  The title text makes fun of Florida which is sometimes called ""The penis of America"". Obviously, this penis is somewhat flaccid (not erect). The use of the word ""state"" is a pun, as it means some particular condition (flaccid state) as well as a political entity (The State of Florida).",The United Shapes A map of things states are shaped like  [Each state has some item wedged to stay inside its borders]
1087: Cirith Ungol,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1087:_Cirith_Ungol,internet,"My all-time favorite example of syntactic ambiguity comes from Wikipedia: 'Charlotte's Web is a children's novel by American author E. B. White, about a pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by an intelligent spider named Charlotte.'","This comic is a mash-up between the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the novel Charlotte's Web.  The title Cirith Ungol is a reference to Lord of the Rings where Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were led to Cirith Ungol by Gollum and to the lair of the ancient spider Shelob.  And therefore in this comic, Frodo (by himself) is being led into the lair of the spider, Charlotte. We can tell by the ""Some Pig"" writing in the spider web on the lower right hand corner which is a direct reference to the story of Charlotte's Web, in which a spider named Charlotte writes the very same text in her web.  The title text refers to syntactic ambiguity which is a property of sentences which may be reasonably interpreted in more than one way, or reasonably interpreted to mean more than one thing. This allows us to derive two different meanings from the same sentence.   The second part of the title text is a quote from Wikipedia, which Randall enjoys for its  syntactic ambiguity, as it can be logically interpreted in either of the following ways:  This quote was modified the same day the comic appeared [1]. It could be found on Wikiquote until 27 April 2016.  A similar ambiguity explicitly discussed in the title text of 1004: Batman.","[A character in a long flowing robe holds up the Phial of Galadriel in one hand; the One Ring is dangling from a necklace in the other.

1167: Star Trek into Darkness,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1167:_Star_Trek_into_Darkness,internet,"Of course, factions immediately sprang up in favor of '~*~sTaR tReK iNtO dArKnEsS~*~', 'xX_StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNess_Xx', and 'Star Trek lnto Darkness' (that's a lowercase 'L').","The talk page of a Wikipedia article is used to discuss changes to the article. An edit war is a dispute about a specific edit to an article, manifesting as a series of edits alternating between making and reverting the change, and usually accompanied by a more-or-less heated debate on the talk page.  Here, Randall is referring to a dispute on the Wikipedia article about Star Trek lnto Darkness (an upcoming Star Trek film at the time of the comic's posting). On the day before the comic was published, the article name had a lowercase ""into"", and the talk page looked like this (rounded off in a friendly way, with the posting of a summary of the arguments, and an exchange of virtual hugs). In summary, the debate centers around whether ""Into Darkness"" should be treated as a prepositional phrase or an unpunctuated subtitle (as in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness""), whether compound prepositions like ""into"" should be capitalized in titles, and whether the capitalization of the title in the movie's official promotional material is relevant. The intensity and multiple facets of a debate over one tiny letter is apparently entertaining to Randall.  Cueball changes the title so that every other letter is capitalized, and adds framing tildes and asterisks (a common, but childish and ugly way of emphasizing titles online). This will probably not go over well.  Megan's line of ""They should have sent a poet."" is a quote from the film Contact. The quote is also featured in 482: Height.  In the movie, the line was meant to convey that only a poet could adequately capture the beauty seen; here, it indicates that prose is insufficient to capture the ironic beauty of the edit war.  The title text indicates Randall's belief that such arguments are perpetual and will always arise. He suggests that the edit to the Wikipedia page will result in a dispute over variants of Cueballs ""compromise"". Because the lowercase ""L"" and the capital ""I"" appear similar in many fonts, he also puts forth the potential argument that the character in the movie's title is a lowercase ""L"".  The old ""favorite edit war"" might be the one referenced in the title text of 878: Model Rail or the one resulting from the addition of the 739: Malamanteau article to Wikipedia  After the publication of the comic, the debate continued with full force, complete with a section of xkcd-inspired suggestions. The article itself was soon protected, so that only administrators could edit it. A day later, the title was changed to one including a capital ""Into"" by the administrator Mackensen.

1193: Externalities,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1193:_Externalities,internet,Mouse over words and things to see where they come from.,"This comic isn't a static image - even the title text changes depending on which part of the image you're hovering over. It presented a competition for students to see who could come closest to break a Skein hash but also an aid appeal for the Wikimedia Foundation.  There are quite a few references in the comic to Baidu. Baidu is a large Chinese Internet services company that employs thousands, whose shares are publicly traded on world stock exchanges. It's the predominant Internet search provider of China, and is sometimes called the ""Google of China"". It offers parallels for the Chinese market of many of the services that Google provides and offers its own encyclopedic wiki with a restricted edit policy to serve as a replacement for Wikipedia. Wikipedia reports that Baidu's search engine handled 56% of Chinese internet search queries in Q4 2010. and that in October 2012, Baidu ranked 5th overall in the Alexa Internet rankings. Given that explanation for the Baidu references in #1193 is still solicited for explainxkcd, Baidu apparently is not well known yet among savvy XKCD readers. Baidu Search results reputedly follow the censorship dictates of the Chinese authorities, causing it to return censored responses to searches for politically sensitive terms like ""Tianamen Square massacre"" or ""Falun Gong"" when executed by web browsers that are connected via Chinese ISPs. When you execute such searches via Baidu in the US, the top links returned for these topics do seem to reflect Chinese government sensibilities although the uncensored English language Wikipedia articles for these topics are listed high in the query results. Baidu's reputation for censorship provides background for Megan's reply ""but nothing about Tianamen Square"" in response to the ""Come and find your future at Baidu"" employment enticement of panel one and also provides the background to understand the ""It takes great minds to stifle other great minds"" slogan of the second panel.   The blank regions in the above image are dynamically generated from various sources.  For the two days until comic 1194 appeared, a competition was underway to see who could come closest to breaking a Skein hash.  The first text line of the first panel contains a link to http://almamater.xkcd.com. This page contained the text:  On this page, users were invited to enter ""Your school's domain name"" — presumably intended to be their college alma mater. (At least in the beginning, only a few top-level domains were accepted.) If the user entered an acceptable domain (by xkcd's rules, which apparently changed during the 48 hours of the competition), he could then enter data values one at a time. For each data value entered, xkcd returned a hash value and the number of bits by which it differed from the target value. The object was to achieve the lowest possible number of differing bits, ideally zero.  A ranking page showed the lowest value achieved for each domain name entered, but not the data that achieved it. The first name on the list was substituted in various panels, and the third-place school showed in panel five. No data values were reported by xkcd, but various results were posted by users of the xkcd forums and on other websites, leading to copycat submissions, so that occasionally large numbers of institutions would show the same moderately low value.  After the end of the contest, the data submission page vanished, replaced by the final list of rankings, which shows that Carnegie Mellon University achieved the best score with 384 bits incorrect out of 1024.  The rankings only show a few hundred out of the several thousand domains submitted—presumably Randall chose to chop the copycat submissions off the end of the list, retaining only honestly obtained results.  In some cases, Megan's reply seems to correspond to the company.  The text in the second panel is based on the company in the first panel:  The text in the form varies independently of the text at the top, sometimes related to the organization in 3rd place:  The title text documents the different sources of data in the comic. The different title texts are:","[This was a dynamic image where the text changed during April 1st.

1331: Frequency,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1331:_Frequency,internet,"This comic shows estimated average frequency. I wanted to include the pitch drop experiment, but it turns out the gif format has some issues with decade-long loops.","This comic shows a number of common events, arranged in a grid. Each of the events flashes with its average frequency.   For example, statistically a child is born somewhere on the world approximately every 0.24 seconds, or four times per second. Therefore, the tile ""One birth"" blinks about 4 times per second.  The title text refers to the Pitch drop experiment which measures the flow of a piece of pitch over many years. At room temperature, tar pitch flows at a very slow rate, taking several years to form a single drop. The title text jokes that Randall tried to include a tile that flashes about once every ten years, but the tiles are all animated GIFs and while the file format supports animations of any length, the resulting file would be too big (at least 10 megabytes).  A thorough analysis of the frequencies present in this comic and how they relate to the underlying technology (the GIF format) was published as Reverse Engineering xkcd's 'Frequency'.

It is a list of Wikipedia article titles that are in the same syllable-stress pattern as the first line of the theme song of the 1987 cartoon series.  The list is compiled in alphabetical order from top to bottom, without respect to the left or right column. Some of the items on this list (e.g. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) are drawn as headlines in the same style as the logo from that series. These articles are not in alphabetical order with the surrounding small face text, but these headlines are in alphabetical order with the other headlines from top to bottom, without respect to the left or right column. Some of these phrases are not actually the titles of Wikipedia articles, but are redirects. For instance, the article on Woodrow Wilson ""Woody"" Guthrie redirects to Woody Guthrie, and Former Arctic Monkeys members redirects to Andy Nicholson.  The syllable-stress pattern of this line is long-short-long-short-long-short-long-short, known in poetry as trochaic tetrameter. Randall has previously authored comics dealing with trochees, namely 856: Trochee Fixation and 1383: Magic Words.  A similar idea was performed by Jimmy Fallon in 2001 at a concert for New York city where he demonstrated singing ""any 80's song"" over the tune of MC Hammer's song ""U Can't Touch This"".  The title text suggests an album of songs (The Purple People Eater, the aforementioned Ninja Turtles theme, Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini and the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers theme), the title or primary refrain of which have a large number of verses in trochaic meter. Randall suggests that these refrains are so interchangeable that the lyrics of each could be sung to the melody of the song following it in the tracklist. Randall would title the album Linked List as each song would melodically reference the next song. The refrains of the songs, respectively are:  There are 6 headlines and 9 other article links in each block next to a headline for a total of 60 wiki links:","WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE TITLES With the right syllable stress pattern to be sung to the tune of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme song      Ace Ventura: Pet Detective    Biggest Loser: Second Chances Cayman Island blue iguana Central Texas pocket gopher Church of Jesus Christ Creator Climate change and meat production Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Daylight saving time in China Denver Airport People Mover Easter Island spiny lobster     Edgar Allan Poe Museum Engine failure after take-off English as a second language Former Arctic Monkeys members Fowler's Modern English Usage Georgia Game and Fish Department Golden-mantled howler monkey Greater Cleveland Film Commission Hairy flower chafer beetle    Asian Human Rights Commission     San Diego City Council    Harland David ""Colonel"" Sanders Human Tissue Resource Network Klondike-class destroyer tender Legal code of North Dakota Lesser knapweed flower weevil Lockheed Martin Atlas rocket Maple syrup urine syndrome Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers Nablus mask-like facial syndrome     Neo Geo Pocket Color New Year's Eve with Carson Daly Newton's second law of motion North Korean Workers Party Orange County Business Council Over/under cable coiling Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater Places named for Adolf Hitler Proton-proton chain reaction    Single payer health insurance     Spotted giant flying squirrel    Puerto Rican lizard-cuckoo Quantuum vacuum plasma thruster Rocky Mountain spotted fever Royal Flying Doctor Service Russian Women's Fascist Movement Semi-active laser guidance Seven Brides for Seven Brothers Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon     Trailing suction hopper dredger Vector graphics markup language Viti Levu giant pigeon Voting rights in Puerto Rico William Henry, Duke of Gloucester Windows Vista startup process Woodrow Wilson ""Woody"" Guthrie Yaba monkey tumor virus Zack and Miri Make a Porno    Women science fiction authors"
1485: Friendship,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1485:_Friendship,internet,"The only other Wikipedia vandalism that I would feel zero remorse about is editing the article on active US militia groups to replace ""militia"" with ""fanclub"".","A ""Bromance"" is a modern slang term for a strong non-romantic relationship between two males. It is a portmanteau of the words brother, meaning a close male friend (aka ""bro""), and romance.  Although current in popular media, some commentators have criticized the implicit homophobia in the term, suggesting that it denotes cultural discomfort at relationships of emotional closeness between men. [1]  In this comic, Randall is implying the Wikipedia page for the word ""bromance"" should more accurately represent what most bromances actually are: friendships. This could be a joke to reference the fact that some males prefer to not call friendships as such, for fear of looking unmasculine, or being confused as a gay couple. The comic makes light of the fact that the word bromance and friendship are interchangeable, and should be treated as such.  The comic later contains parts of the edited article, mocking the use of ""bromance"" in popular culture, implying that ""friendships"" can be used just as easily to describe platonic male relationships.  Despite supposedly vandalizing the ""bromance"" article, the article is titled ""friendship"", giving a similar result to word-replacement browser extensions, as in 1031: s/keyboard/leopard/. It is also possible, however, that a {{DISPLAYTITLE:Friendship}} tag was added to the article's source code to cause the page's name to display as such.  The title text implies Randall does not agree with Wikipedia vandalism, except in the case of bromance/friendship, and also militia/fanclub, possibly to make light of the harsh sounding word in a negative light.  In the wake of this comic, several Wikipedia pages were vandalized, among them Bromance, Militia organizations in the United States, Militia (United States), and Friendship. All these pages were semi-protected by an administrator against further attempts for a week after this comic was published.  The day this comic was published, a vote to delete the Bromance article was initiated on Wikipedia.[2]  A later comic called 1746: Making Friends, was also not so much about friendship, but rather about vultures...","[A Wikipedia style layout is shown for extracts from an article titled Friendship.]  Friendship From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A Friendship is a close non-romantic relationship between two (or more) men, a form of affectional or homosocial intimacy.[1]  Contents [Hide] 1 Etymology 2 Characteristics 3 Portrayal of friendship 3.1 Celebrity and fictional friendships 3.2 Historical and political friendships 3.3 Gay-straight friendships  4 See also 5 References Etymology Friendship is a portmanteau of the words friend and ship.

Each item is listed in the table below.  Items near the top-right corner (such as the MH 370 disappearance) are both mysterious and strange. Items near the bottom-left corner (such as Randall's absent-mindedness regarding ice cream) have a clear explanation and are not really strange either. Items near the top-left corner (such as the meaning of You're So Vain) are mysterious but not really strange. Items near the bottom-right corner (such as the Dyatlov Pass incident) have a clear explanation but are quite strange.   The title text refers to the mystery of Randall staying up late to read Wikipedia articles, when he was already supposed to be asleep an hour ago. This is apparently not very unusual for him (see for instance 214: The Problem with Wikipedia). And this mystery actually has an obvious explanation: Following up on an idea that eventually led to today's cartoon.  Some of these mysteries have already been explored in xkcd. See 950: Mystery Solved where Randall ""solves"" Amelia Earhart, Lost Roanoke Colony, Jimmy Hoffa; 593: Voynich Manuscript; and 1400: D.B. Cooper.  Note that Randall uses similar diagrams in both 388: Fuck Grapefruit and 1242: Scary Names which also contain different items.

1521: Sword in the Stone,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1521:_Sword_in_the_Stone,internet,That seems like an awful lot of hassle when all I wanted was a cool sword.,"In this comic, Megan pulls a sword out of a stone. A flash of light comes down and music plays, and a heavenly voice tells her she has ascended to the throne of England. Megan then pulls out her phone and searches on Wikipedia for England . After having read for a while she begins, while reading on, to replace the sword into the rock.  The comic references the fables of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. In Arthurian legend, whoever can remove The Sword in the Stone is the lawful king of Britain (although this comic, like some versions of the legend, refers only to England). Arthur is an orphan being raised in secret; he notices the sword, removes it, and is proclaimed king. The sword is sometimes identified as Excalibur, although in other versions Excalibur was acquired by King Arthur from the Lady of the Lake. The most familiar version of this story is The Sword in the Stone by T. H. White which is based on Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory. The animated musical by Walt Disney is a well known version of this fairytale based on White's book.  A key element in the joke is that as Megan begins to read about England, especially information concerning being an English ruler, she quickly thinks better of this and begins to put the sword back in its place. The punchline that Megan puts the sword back after reading about England suggests that the ""gift"" of being the leader of England is not worth the risk and/or work associated. British history is rife with monarchic strife, and a brief inquiry into their causes of death will show that almost one in three British rulers have died either in battle or from murder, etc. This would quickly lead most sane people to conclude that the risks associated with ruling England far outweigh the benefits.  The title text furthers this plot, having Megan comment on the hassle when the only thing she was interested in was the cool sword. Apparently Megan is not enthusiastic about power, and her choice is made when she sees how problematic it could be to reign over the country of England. There is also a subtle play on the fact that in the T. H. White version, Arthur likewise is unaware of the significance of pulling the sword from the stone; he is simply looking for a sword to replace the one belonging to his step-brother Kay that was stolen under his watch, to avoid embarrassment and reproach.  From the time of the Roman Empire all the way up to Charles II's reclamation of the throne, the area now known as England has seen several migration waves, Viking raids, invasions and fierce power struggles among aristocratic families. Besides the constant threat of usurpation, as evidenced by the numerous wars for the crown, such as the Norman conquest and the War of the Roses, there were also constant difficulties in managing the frontier regions. This can be seen from Hadrian's Wall, a creation of the titular Roman Emperor designed to keep the ever difficult Scots out of the areas of Roman control (the Scots would be a constant problem for England up until the reign of King James VI and I; think of the movie Braveheart for a good example of the regular headaches they caused, seen from the English point of view), as well as the Welsh uprisings that occurred with such consistency that you could set your watch by them.  It is worth emphasizing that the term ""England"" is anachronistic in this context. At the time Arthur supposedly existed, there was no England — England was formed by Germanic tribes who settled in Britain between the fifth and seventh centuries. In many of the stories, including the earliest, Arthur was in fact was depicted as a leader of the native Romano-Britons in their attempts to repel these invaders. England would not exist had Arthur succeeded. The anachronism is not new; it entered Arthurian legend in the Middle Ages. (Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, for example, refers to Arthur as King of England.) In Arthurian legend it was stated that Arthur would return when needed (in some versions he was explicitly associated with the Mab Darogan, a Welsh Messianic figure who would finally drive the English out of Britain and reclaim it for the native Britons).  It is possible that Megan in this comic is a 21st-century reincarnation of Arthur.  The timing of this comic might relate to the birth of princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana on May 2, 2015 just four days before this comic, and the burden of a royal of having a whole life in public shaking hands of strangers. Since 2013 the line of succession was changed to absolute primogeniture, meaning that she will keep her current position in the line (4th after her older brother) even if she later gets baby brothers. Before this year, that would not have been the case, as the male gender took rank over birth order.  It is also probably not a coincidence that this comic was published the day before the UK General Election, occurring on May 7, 2015. This election decides the modern-day leader of the UK. And the problems they face today, may even be more likely to cause Megan to give away the throne, than the risk of untimely death she would have faced in Arthur's days.  A similar Wikipedia gag appears in 911: Magic School Bus.",[Megan walks up to a sword in a stone.]  [Megan attempts to pull the sword out of the stone.]  [A beam of light and music plays as she removes the sword.]  [While standing with the swords a voice from the sky speaks in gray shaky letters:] Celestial voice: The Throne of England is yours  [Megan takes out her smart phone and searches:] Wikipedia England  [Megan reads on her phone.]  [Megan starts to replace the sword back into the stone.]
1551: Pluto,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1551:_Pluto,internet,"After decades of increasingly confused arguing, Pluto is reclassified as a ""dwarf Pluto.""","This comic was posted on Tuesday, July 14, 2015, in honor of the New Horizons deep space probe making its flyby at Pluto, thus breaking the typical Monday/Wednesday/Friday cycle for the xkcd comics. Also on this day he released the first what if? in over three months, and it was called New Horizons. Luckily it did not end up back on Earth, as depicted in 1532: New Horizons, released 1½ month before closest approach.  Randall has taken one of the probes images of Pluto, and outlined humorous examples of pareidolia on top of it.  It can be compared to preliminary descriptions by geologists, e.g. New Horizons' best look at Pluto before close approach|The Planetary Society.  The comic probably winks at Percival Lowell whose observatory photographed Pluto in 1915 ""known"" as Planet X. Unfortunately Percival Lowell is most famous for are his drawings of the Canals on Mars which are widely misunderstood as channels based on wrong translations from Italian to other languages.  The title text refers to the debate as to whether Pluto should be classified as a full or dwarf planet. This debate was particularly brought into the public eye, and came to be seen as a matter of controversy, following the 2006 IAU definition of planet. The text may imagine that this debate winds on, with definitions being created and revised until a ridiculous state is reached whereby Pluto has a special class of celestial body named after it called a 'Pluto', but fails to fulfill the arbitrary criteria set up for it, and hence is called a 'dwarf Pluto'.  There actually exist the terms Plutoid and Plutino, that relate directly to groups that Pluto belongs to, but see those pages for details of their use and usage.  Suggests Pluto is a confection, like Minmus. May also be a reference to the Mars candy bar.  The JPEG image format has the common issue of slightly distorting an image with Compression artifacts. The artifacts shown here do not appear in the official version of this image, but all data sent from New Horizons is compressed and artifacts are common — the full resolution images will be submitted to earth over the next 16 months. There have been tweets about people seeing plumes associated with active volcanoes and the like, which were explained as being artifacts.  Interpreting Pluto as a head, the frontal bone could be the light-colored region next to the darker top, just above the north pole facing to us.    The area above Pluto's north pole is attributed to grease.  Could refer to possible extraterrestrial life on Pluto in the form of insects, or ""bugs"". In the animated TV series Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles, an adaptation of Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers, the first battles with the alien ""Bugs"" took place on Pluto. Maybe it also refers to a software bug at the probe.  A string of small round features which Randall suggests were the result of Pluto getting shot repeatedly, probably by meteorites.  Reference to the what if?, Drain the Oceans: Part II, about draining the Earth's oceans onto Mars. In the previous what if?, Drain the Oceans, the Netherlands took over the Earth once their problem with the risk of flooding disappeared. And then they continued to issued forth from the portal that drained the oceans on Earth pouring them onto Mars, to claim Mars as New Netherlands. Presumably something similar happened on Pluto. This was already again references in both an entry in the table and in the title text of 1555: Exoplanet Names 2.  Since the base photograph is identified as ""today's New Horizons image,"" this indicates that a section of Pluto has immediately become the subject of some controversy, possibly a territorial claim or one of several references to the fact that Pluto was demoted from full planet status in 2006.  A generic map hazard.  Pareidolia is the human brain's tendency to see patterns where they don't exist. While probably a reference to Pluto's heart, the joke is also recursive: You'd be seeing the text of a Wikipedia article explaining to you that you couldn't actually be seeing the text of a Wikipedia article.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  The Kuiper belt is a region in our solar system that contains an unknown amount of icy bodies, one known is Pluto. Randall jokingly refers to Kuiper Belt as the same kind of belt that's used to fasten clothing, and identifies features on Pluto's surface as loops for the belt.  An outline of the Firefly-class spaceship Serenity, which was the titular vessel from the 2002 TV series Firefly. One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  Nobody can see a dinosaur unless Randall did do this painting on Pluto's surface. And a complex comic needs at least one dinosaur.  A section of Pluto that is objectively better than the rest.  This could be interpreted as a moon growing/emerging out of pluto, as a bud is ""a compact knob-like growth"". A round growth is seen at the location marked, resembling a small, emerging moon.  A reference to the classic video game Pacman, wherein the primary antagonists are one of four Ghosts. The Ghost on Pluto appears to have a mouth, however, unlike most depictions of the Pacman Ghosts. One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  Suggests Pluto had dinosaurs and lost them the same way Earth did.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined, and the only one (currently) also informally named as such by NASA.  Also known as ischemic heart disease, which causes degradation of heart tissue.  The region identified in the comic looks less 'healthy' (is darker and more ragged) compared to the rest of the 'Heart', which Randall suggests is caused by the disease.  Referring to the general practice of naming extraterrestrial mountains ""X Mons"" (e.g. Olympus Mons, a mountain on Mars and the largest mountain in the Solar System), as well as naming terrestrial mountains ""Mount X"". Since ""mons"" is Latin for ""mountain"", the feature's suggested name translates as ""Mount Mountain"".  A terrain feature suitable for connecting an outside source of electricity for the benefit of implied internal batteries. Compare ""dock connector,"" below.  Implying that Pluto is some manner of giant egg. Possibly a reference to the Doctor Who episode Kill the Moon, in which the Moon is revealed to be an egg from which a monster is hatching. A 2014 article from The Onion, ""Moon Finally Hatches,"" makes the same joke. Also possibly a reference to The Light Fantastic, a Discworld novel in which similar objects are revealed to be the eggs of the world turtle. A similar idea appeared in Jack Williamson's 1934 short story ""Born of the Sun"".  Balls often have a ""plug"" or opening to insert a needle to inflate or deflate them.  Since it's all-caps, we can't tell if ""PREDATOR"" is a proper noun, but this is possibly a reference to the movie series Predator, about a race of aliens who hunt other beings for sport. Alternatively, a planetary predator (such as comic book villain Galactus) may have previously scarred Pluto.  The structure indicated is a small black dot (at least at this distance this picture was taken). Reset buttons on home electronics are often small buttons or holes used to reset the software of the electronic device.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined, this one in the shape of a popular video game protagonist.  Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet rather than a planet following the latter term's controversial redefinition in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.  Arguments about the classification continue to pop up. The same argument is referenced in the title text. The name implies a proposal to put all the people still arguing about it in this hole on Pluto. This proposal further implies that the continued debate is very annoying by 2015, except perhaps to the debaters themselves.  The area indicated is near the terminator and shows some intriguing topographic relief.   A neoplasm or tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue. Randall is suggesting that the abnormal region near the heart has been evaluated by a doctor and determined to be benign.  Suggests the discrepancy in color over Pluto's surface may be a function of what cake frosting was used where. This area is the ""dark spot"" at the head of the ""whale"" (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/14/science/space/pluto-flyby.html).  The so-called ""whale's tail"" (http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/find-heart-whale-new-horizons-picture-pluto-n388816), is on the other hemisphere and is not visible in this image, it lies east about 90 degrees from the chocolate frosting/dark spot here.  As above, suggests the discrepancy in color over Pluto's surface may be a function of what cake frosting was used where.  A reference to the Disney animated feature The Lion King. In the movie, the Pridelands is the bright and prosperous region ruled by the Lion King while a dark territory beyond its border is controlled by hyenas.

1665: City Talk Pages,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1665:_City_Talk_Pages,internet,I don't think the Lakeshore Air Crash Museum really belongs under 'Tourist Attractions.' It's not a museum--it's just an area near the Lake Festival Laser Show where a lot of planes have crashed,"The comic makes fun of Wikipedia talk pages. On Wikipedia, every article has a place to discuss the content of the page, called a talk page"". In this case, the comic talks about the talk page of an article about a city. While some of the topics are quite normal for such a page (e.g. the quality of the images) others are not (e.g. too many murders and mine disasters in the city). The topics discussed suggest that the city has many problems and is a bad place to live in or visit.  The topics show a common problem at Wikipedia's talk pages: People often use them as a place to talk about the subject of the article, but it is for talking about the article itself. Someone at the top of the talk page is suggesting a better name for the city.  The article repeatedly refers to ""the murders"", suggesting that the city might be well-known for them. It seems that the editors cannot agree on how notable ""the murders"" are. ""Not that notable"" refers to Wikipedia's general criteria for including information in articles. Material which is not noteworthy should be removed; however, different editors often disagree about what is notable, resulting in conflicting edits as text is inserted and then removed (an ""edit war""). Someone replies that ""all cities have murders"". While true, many cities in low-crime countries would not have a series of them so well-known that when someone talks about ""the murders"" any reader could be expected to know what they are talking about, making this sound like an attempt to make the city sound nicer than it is. ""I think the murderer is reverting my edits"" suggests the murders are being committed by one person who is influencing how they are shown on Wikipedia - perhaps trying to prevent Wikipedia from publishing evidence of them or possibly publicise them by adding more information about them. This raises the possibility that the discussion of the murder visible in the infobox picture may have been initiated by the murderer.  The infobox is a short fact sheet that many articles in the (English) Wikipedia have; it generally includes an image illustrating the subject of the article. The question of which picture is best for the infobox (because this image is so prominent) can cause edit wars. It emerges that the photograph of the city has a murder in it. Instead of forwarding the picture to law enforcement, someone uses the image editing software Photoshop to erase the murder so the picture will be less objectionable. It appears that murders are so common in the city that any random photograph of the city has a chance of showing a murder, to the point where a second photo proposed as a replacement for the infobox picture is found to show another murder.  Voltaire was a French Enlightenment writer. As a prominent and very opinionated intellectual, he gets a lot of quotes falsely attributed to him; most famously, he did not actually say ""I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"" (that was Evelyn Beatrice Hall).  It seems that the people who are editing the article are getting desperate to find a non-bleak picture of the city. When a non-bleak picture is added, it turns out to be from the 2016 Disney film Zootopia. The fictional city which is the setting and title of the film has a distinctive look which is far from bleak, but is not a picture of the city. (Zootopia is called Zootropolis in many European countries for trademark reasons.)  The city apparently is a mining city and there have been some mining disasters. An editor is complaining that this section is too long, but another editor points out that this is because there have been so many mining disasters that a large section is needed to cover the topic.   1982 Secession refers to Key West, Florida seceding from the United States in 1982 to form the Conch Republic.  A known problem on Wikipedia is ""coatracking"", where people use articles to promote topics that are not strictly the subject of the article (perhaps by writing far more about them than is necessary, when they could just be mentioned in passing). Here, it emerges that the article on a city expresses a dubious opinion on condom use. This is against several Wikipedia policies: it would be irrelevant to the article and sounds like an editor's attempt to publicise their views.  Andrew Lloyd Webber is an English composer famous for writing The Phantom Of The Opera. Webber is also known for writing the music for Starlight Express, a rock opera about anthropomorphized trains, which is probably another factor in the train station joke. Meanwhile, Frank Lloyd Wright, who shares his middle name and last initial, was an American architect, who designed more than 1,000 structures. As it turns out it was the composer who was responsible for the train station, and as a result the station roof has collapsed.  It is complained that the article is promoting the ""Lake Festival Laser Show"" too much. In the alt text, it emerges that the laser show is so impressive that it has caused a number of aeroplanes to crash. This probably refers to the fact that laser pointers should not be aimed at aircrafts, as they can be distracting to the pilots. The article has been promoting this area of crashed planes as the ""Lakeshore Air Crash Museum"", despite it not having any educational purpose.","[Caption above the panel: ] I love reading the Wikipedia talk pages for articles on individual cites  [A list of contents for a Wikipedia talk page regarding an article about a city.

1690: Time-Tracking Software,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1690:_Time-Tracking_Software,internet,"List of helicopter prison escapes' and 'List of sexually active popes' are both entertainingly long, but sadly there's no 'List of helicopter prison escapes involving sexually active popes.'","In this comic, Randall uses time-tracking software, which is intended to increase productivity by identifying how you are spending time, that reveals that he is doing frivolous and pointless things that take up large amounts of his time. He makes remixes, edits Star Wars footage, reads strange (albeit entertaining) Wikipedia articles (see 214: The Problem with Wikipedia), and even spends a large amount of time adjusting this software, all without getting anything useful done. Thus, he is embarrassed at this revelation. This time waste is a common subject on xkcd, as shown for instance in the comic mentioned above.  The visual appearance of lightsabers in the Star Wars movies of the original trilogy has been digitally changed twice during the re-releases for the 2004 DVD and 2011 Blu-ray releases. There are several Star Wars fans that feel the need to alter the movies (mainly to revert the changes made in the re-release), but so far nobody felt the need to replace lightsabers with metal swords.  Jack & Diane is a rock song written in 1982 by John Mellencamp. ""Suckin' on a chili dog outside the tastee freeze"" is the first line of the second verse of the song (see the lyrics here). A remix made using just this line would probably sound a bit repetitive (listen for instance to this re-mix of Don't You Want Me, that almost only uses the first line of the song).  Two Wikipedia lists are mentioned in the comic and title text; List of helicopter prison escapes and List of sexually active popes. Given that the Pope is supposed to be celibate (at least after 1139), the mere fact that more than ten popes have been involved in sexual activity, even after 1139, is both amusing and intriguing. There are more than forty entries in the helicopter escape list for real-life attempts (plus 16 in fiction); not all of them succeeded, but several did!  This xkcd comic was published on June 6th. On that day, the Wikipedia article ""List of helicopter prison escapes involving sexually active popes"" was created and subsequently deleted.  On June 7th, the Wikipedia Facebook page posted a link to the List of helicopter prison escapes article. A user commented asking if the article was posted on Facebook due to the xkcd comic, and Wikipedia replied by pasting an image of the xkcd comic, which seems to indicate that the Wikipedia representative running the Facebook page was aware of this xkcd comic and posted the list in reference to the comic.  In the title text, Randall mentions his disappointment with the lack of a Wikipedia list stemming from the intersection of the two; that is, a helicopter prison escape involving a sexually active pope. With the last sexually active pope being Pope Leo XII in the 1820s, and helicopter predecessors only taking flight in 1907, and mass production of helicopters not occurring until the 1950s, such an event has probably never happened.  The Wikipedia list of sexually active popes has been mentioned before in the what if? Into the Blue on infinitely powerful lasers, and after noting that such a thing cannot exist, the list is offered as a replacement for entertainment.  The comic 1692: Man Page was released later that week and also mentioned the pope.","[This comic shows a pie chart with 5 slices, each with a label and a line pointing to these five different sized slices.

1900: Jet Lag,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1900:_Jet_Lag,internet,"I had some important research to do on proposed interstellar space missions, basketball statistics, canceled skyscrapers, and every article linked from ""Women in warfare and the military in the 19th century.""","Hairy has just woken up at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and Ponytail mentions he must be still jet lagged (possibly from a recent trip). Hairy then accidentally public confesses that he has actually been up to some late-night Wikipedia browsing and reading about maritime disasters.  In the caption Randall confesses that he loves traveling, because he can then use jet lag as a nice excuse for what is actually his usual messed up sleep cycle.  In the title text, Randall states that he had to do some important research. But what he lists, are clearly also just topics he read in Wikipedia: proposed interstellar space missions, basketball statistics, canceled skyscrapers, and every article linked from ""Women in warfare and the military in the 19th century."" Randall has earlier illustrated this issue in 214: The Problem with Wikipedia.  Randall has previously discussed his oft-changing sleep cycle in 320: 28-Hour Day and 448: Good Morning, and has alluded to it more subtly in 68: Five Thirty, 92: Sunrise, and 776: Still No Sleep. We can thus see that this is a habit of Randall's that has persisted for more than a decade, as has his obsession with Wikipedia.","[Hairy, with more messed up hair than usual, is rubbing his eyes while small ""sleepy"" bubbles form over his head, while walking towards Ponytail.] Hairy: Sorry, I just woke up. Ponytail: It's 3 PM! ...Oh, of course, you're still jet lagged. Hairy: I-yeah, that's it! I definitely didn't spend half the night reading Wikipedia articles about random maritime disasters.

202: YouTube,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/202:_YouTube,internet,I pray GunPistolMan never learns the word 'sheeple'.,"This comic is pointing out the fact that many of the comments on YouTube videos are insipid and poorly informed, being pointless arguments over some minor topic or factually incorrect position. In this case, the Moon landing hoaxers are at the receiving end of Randall's pen.  This comic was published in December 2006. In July 2009, a restored video showing Neil Armstrong's first moonwalk was uploaded to YouTube. User Michael Huang copied to that video's comments section all the sentences in this comic. Then, after some other users took some of his comments seriously, he later added another comment stating, ""This entire comment chain is from the famous webcomic, xkcd."" The comments are copied verbatim, including typos and grammar errors. The only mistake is in the first comment: Michael Huang included only one question mark when the comic has three of them.  The title text is the first reference to Sheeple, which appeared a few more times in xkcd comics. The reputation of YouTube comment threads as cesspools of abject stupidity and blatant trolling is revisited in 301: Limerick and 481: Listen to Yourself. The username CrackMonkey74 appears again in 406: Venting and 574: Swine Flu.","The Internet has always had loud dumb people, but I've never seen anything quite as bad as the people who comment on YouTube videos.

462: Freemanic Paracusia,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/462:_Freemanic_Paracusia,internet,It's amazing what it does for YouTube comments.,"Paracusia is a form of hallucination that involves perceiving sounds without auditory stimulus.  Morgan Freeman is an American actor who may be best known as the character Red in The Shawshank Redemption, where he is also the narrator. He narrates because he is especially known for his soothing and mellow voice, which helps him amplify performances in minor parts, such as God in Bruce Almighty. He has been a narrator of many TV programs and also narrated the major film War of the Worlds where he did not play any other part.  The comic is a play on the combination of the two. The idea is that while reading a text, instead of hearing you own voice in your mind's ear, you substitute it for Freeman's voice, giving a new perspective on the contents of the text. Here, the voice of Morgan Freeman converts the most annoying possible thing on the web (penis enlargement advertisements) into a soothing meditation.  The title text suggests to apply this specifically on the mostly stupid comments on YouTube, like those found in 202: YouTube.","[Cueball is sitting behind a desk with a computer.] Freemanic Paracusia: A disorder wherein you hear everything you read in the comforting voice of Morgan Freeman. [There is a thought bubble of Cueball's thoughts, within it is Morgan Freeman reading text.] Morgan Freeman: Why, you could enlarge your penis for cheap. My, my. Isn't that something."
481: Listen to Yourself,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/481:_Listen_to_Yourself,internet,"Man, I just wanted to know how babby was formed.","YouTube is a website for video sharing where anyone can upload and view videos. It is notorious for having some of the most ridiculous, hateful, mean-spirited, nonsensical comments of any mainstream website (a reputation touched upon earlier in 202: YouTube).  Danish tells Black Hat that her computer virus reads a YouTube user's comments back to them before it is submitted. Upon hearing their own ridiculous comments read aloud to them, they will realize the stupidity of it and not submit the comment. YouTube later made this a real feature, although it has since been removed again.  The title text is in reference to a post left on the Yahoo! Answers website in 2006 by a submitter known as ""kavya,"" who asks ""how is babby formed / how girl get pragnent."" The post picked up internet popularity and spawned several flash animations. This was again mentioned in 522: Google Trends and in 550: Density.","[Black Hat approaches Danish typing at a computer.] Black Hat: What are you writing? Danish: Virus. Black Hat: What's it do?

920: YouTube Parties,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/920:_YouTube_Parties,internet,"This reminds me of that video where... no? How have you not seen that? Oh man, let me find it. No, it's ok, we can go back to your video later.","A YouTube party is when a group of people show each other YouTube videos. The problem with YouTube parties is that no one pays attention to the video that's playing; instead, each person is thinking of the video that they personally want to play next.  You can see analogous behavior at any get-together where couples (parents) are telling stories about their kids. Nobody cares about anybody else's kid; they are just waiting (not even listening) until they get the chance to talk about their own offspring.  The joke seems to be that everybody is doing this, but it is unclear whether they realize it. They each seem to be under the delusion that the others will be fascinated by ""their"" video (or child's accomplishments), even though the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. Possibly they don't care about that either; they just want an audience, even an unwilling one.  This may be defensible where kids are involved, because the parents could reasonably feel that the accomplishments of their children reflect well on themselves. However, the people in the YouTube party didn't create the videos, they just found them. Which makes their behavior (or perhaps YouTube parties in general) even more insane and pointless.  The title text reiterates this point. The speaker is reminded of another video that is so superior to the one currently playing that we should find it and watch it immediately. We can always go back to the current video later (if anybody still remembers, that is; and according to the comic above no one will want to remember it).","[Cueball and a group are standing in a dark room around a table. The group and Cueball are illuminated by a laptop on the table.] The problem with YouTube parties: Cueball (thinking): This video is blowing their MINDS. Group (thinking): Oh man, I know what video we should watch once this is over."
1804: Video Content,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1804:_Video_Content,internet,"So, like, sexy news videos? ""No, people have tried that--it's still just video content. We need to actually inform people THROUGH making out. I would call it 'Mouth Content,' but I think that's already the title of a Neil Cicierega album.""","This comic is a commentary on the declining publishing industry and their unsuccessful attempts at regaining an audience.  News media has evolved dramatically as the world entered the information era.  Newspapers, which were at one point the most widely distributed and consumed form of media, have rapidly been eclipsed by new technologies such as television, Internet, and streaming video.  Subscriptions to paper-based media have been drastically declining to the point where many publishers are on the verge of shutting down.  While publishers are making an effort to move their content to newer, more popular forms of media, in many cases they are still clearly behind the times.  The comic illustrates one such example with Cueball suggesting presenting news stories as videos rather than text. This is presented and received by Megan, Hairbun and Hairy as a clever new idea that would appeal to young people based on the fact that they like watching YouTube videos. However, apparently no one in the comic has realized that television news programs have been filling such a niche for decades and that young people are just as uninterested. In fact, online video based news is often considered annoying, especially if autoplaying or if there is no text based alternative. In reality, this idea is not at all original and likely to be doomed to fail from the start.  As with many similar attempts, the new ""ideas"" that publishers are trying to adopt are merely cramming news content into things young people like, without really understanding why they like it and without considering whether news would be a good fit.  In the caption, Randall suggests it would be pointless to argue with newspaper publishers about their ideas.  Presumably Randall believes publishers who fall for those ideas are already out of touch with the new generation, and would not be able to understand why those ideas lack merit.  Instead, he suggests taking the trend to a ridiculous extreme, by telling publishers that young people like making out.  Suppose publishers follow the same pattern and try to cram news into this as well, they would end up creating some form of news program centered around making out.  The results may turn out completely laughable or highly entertaining.  If the former, it could serve as a wake-up call to publishers that they need to reconsider their approach.  If the latter, then it could actually become a trend and unexpectedly reinvigorate the industry.  In the title text it seems like the news agency actually consider this idea, or is at least confused enough to ask. Their interpretation of combining ""making out"" with news is to make it sexy, but the next speaker says that this has been tried before and doesn't work. This is likely a reference to Naked News [link potentially NSFW], a news program that does that: it features attractive women delivering the news while simultaneously disrobing. This concept has not, for some reason, spread to the mainstream.  According to the speaker, merely making the news sexy is not enough – the news content must be directly integrated into the making out; how this would be accomplished is as yet unclear.  The title text also dismisses the proposed name Mouth Content as possibly the title of a Neil Cicierega album, in reference to his recently-released Mouth Moods, as well as his prior albums Mouth Sounds and Mouth Silence.","[From left to right: Hairy, Cueball, Megan and Hairbun sit around a conference table.] Cueball: Research shows young people like YouTube, so we should present news stories as videos instead of text!

1836: Okeanos,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1836:_Okeanos,internet,WHEN I WAS ON A BOAT I DROPPED MY PHONE CAN U LOOK FOR IT,"The NOAAS Okeanos Explorer, named after the Greek (and Roman) personification of the sea Okeanos, is a vessel that is currently exploring the Central Pacific Basin. It livestreams the video feed [1] of its deep sea exploration online.   This comic seems to be a representation of the livestream on YouTube [2]; see the table below for details.   The chat section for the actual livestream is disabled, but the comic adds some humorous examples of what the chat section would look like.  Several of the examples are the product of commenters falsely believing the livestream is that of a game, probably since most livestreams on YouTube are of people playing games; Randall is joking about the viewers of said streams in particular not being able to tell the difference, as well as YouTube commenters in general. Randall has mentioned the ridiculousness of comments on YouTube before in both 202: YouTube and 481: Listen to Yourself. One of the comments seems to refer to Minecraft, since one of the comments asks why nothing is being crafted (crafting is an action in Minecraft used to make items).  In the caption below Randall states that he likes to view the stream and commends them on disabling the chat section, for the reasons given in the comic above.  The title text is yet another comment by someone who dropped their phone in the ocean from a boat, and now wants to use Okeanos' resources to find it, which is of course impossible, as the phone will by now be hidden in the silt on the bottom. And even if not, the chance of finding anything dropped in the Pacific Ocean, the largest Ocean on the Earth, is all but zero. Also, the Central Pacific Basin, where Okeanos was at the time of this comic's release, is 6500 meters deep; at that depth the water pressure is approximately 4454.863 kilopascals, or roughly 646 PSI. This is probably enough to irrevocably damage something as breakable as a cell phone. Even if the phone were of the so-called ""waterproof"" variety, that rating is usually only applicable to a few meters of depth rather than thousands of meters.  Needless to say, retrieving one's phone from the bottom of the Central Pacific Basin would be a challenging and pointless endeavor.","[The comic takes place during a typical YouTube livestream.

565: Security Question,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/565:_Security_Question,email,"Let's invite him to a party and play 'I never'. Okay, I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street. ...he's taking a drink!","Security questions are sensitive questions that allow a user to retrieve or reset his password if the password is lost or stolen. Because of this powerful function, security questions should be treated just as seriously as passwords. Typical security questions include ""What's your mother's maiden name?"" or ""What's your secondary school?"" and are intended to be easy for the user to answer but hard for anyone else to answer.  In this comic, however, the security question is deployed in a strange way, as the question ""Where are the bodies buried?"" assumes that one had buried bodies, hence had killed someone. The question turns out to be a ploy by the police, who were trying to bait Cueball into confessing his crime, as well as revealing the location of the incriminating evidence.  ""I never"" is a drinking game that somebody says ""I never did something"" to the others. If you never did it, you don't need to drink, otherwise, drink. Since he takes a drink for ""I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street"", the police have narrowed down the search area. The next statement in the game could be ""I never hid any bodies WEST of Central Avenue"" (or whatever road dividing the area), further localizing the bodies to a quarter of the original search area, in a Twenty Questions manner. Of course, by taking the drink Cueball also admits that he buried bodies, though this evidence would not likely be accepted by any court.","[Cueball sits at a computer.] Computer Screen: -Email Account Setup- To verify your identity, we need to ask you a question nobody else could answer.

These factors, among others, means that 3D printers are beginning to be found in homes, rather than exclusively in businesses. Ponytail & Cueball are discussing the improvements and expect widespread deployment soon.  Spam emails promoting penis-enlargement products are very common, and often show images of unnaturally large penises to advertise how effective they are. The adverts prevalence and aggressive marketing techniques have made them a well known staple of email inboxes, though the improvement of spam filters has increasingly banished them to the spam folder.  Cueball and Ponytail predict that the spam producers will quickly jump on the opportunity presented by the widespread prevalence of 3D printers, and start advertising their wares with 3D printed phalluses. Usually someone would have to chose to print out a spam email, but it wouldn't be difficult to imagine a scenario where the email contains malicious code which automatically prints them a huge phallus.  In the title text, Better Homes and Gardens is an American magazine that, as the name suggests, shows you how to make your home and garden better often by reusing common household items in new and innovative ways. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (or ABS) is a light-weight and moldable plastic which makes it perfect for 3D printers.","[Two people before a 3D printer, one with a wrench.] Cueball: 3D printers are getting incredible.

If a form asks for some information that is really much more crucial, and this standard routine thoughtlessly isn't used for those fields too, it would comically seem that the form-makers consider your email address to be hideously important, maybe even more important than the location where a missile is programmed to land. In the comic, the impression is that it is less important that the wrong city is not accidentally wiped out, than that the boss knows who to blame afterwards.  The title text suggests a real world parallel to this. Randall has heard about differing priorities of identifying who is purchasing a firearm (the state/locality requires one form of identification) and ensuring the payment (the store requires two forms of ID, to properly document the person, in case the check is fake or is rejected by the bank). The point is that people often care a lot about money, but a gun in the wrong hands is a potential disaster bigger than a few hundred missing dollars.  This is the only comic so far to feature Green Hat. It appears that the green hat means that he is part of the military.","[Green Hat sitting at a computer.] Computer: Welcome to the missile launch interface! Click Computer: Enter the target's coordinates. Type Type Computer: Enter your email address for our records. Type Type Computer: Enter your email again, to ensure you typed it correctly."
1181: PGP,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1181:_PGP,email,"If you want to be extra safe, check that there's a big block of jumbled characters at the bottom.","PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a program which can be used to encrypt and/or sign data, including messages sent as emails. Encrypting means encoding data in a way that requires a secret key to decrypt and read; signing means that there is a code included in the data which can be used to verify the identify of the sender and that the data has not been altered in transit.  In the case of the email in this comic, it has only been signed; not encrypted (hence, the top of the first line of text can be seen and is legible in normal English). This is more common than encryption, as reading an encrypted message would require the recipient to already be a PGP user. In fact, the use of PGP even to sign email messages is so rare that most people have probably never seen a signed message. Because a signed email is so rare, and because it is already legible and unencrypted, Randall is making the tongue-in-cheek observation that few users, technical or otherwise, actually know how to use the signature to verify the authenticity of the sender using the PGP signature, and that such users can safely assume that since there is a signature, that is good enough evidence that the message is authentic. Further, because PGP signatures are so rare and probably ignored by most recipients, he suggests one would not expect anyone to even bother creating a false PGP signature; therefore the mere existence of a PGP header would suggest authenticity.  The title text extends the joke by suggesting you confirm there's a bunch of random characters in the footer (this is the actual signature that PGP generates which can be used to verify the authenticity of the email). Again, Randall is humorously suggesting that the existence of the block is itself sure evidence of authenticity.","How to use PGP to verify that an email is authentic: Look for this text at the top [In mail header, light grey.] Reply [Highlighted, with arrow pointing to it from the text ""Look for this text at the top"" above.] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- [In mail message, light grey.] HASH: SHA256 Hey, First of all, thanks for taking care of  [After mail message.] If it's there, the email is probably fine"
1783: Emails,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1783:_Emails,email,"Hey Rob, sorry it took me a while to get back to you! Sure, I'd love to see WALL-E opening weekend! Are you still doing that, or...?","In this rather late New Year comic (January 9th), Megan asks Cueball if he has any New Year's resolutions. New Year's is, to many people, a time for thinking about the year and coming up with resolutions to improve themselves. These kind of resolutions hardly ever work.  Cueball replies that he has one resolution. It's to finish reading and replying to his backlog of emails from 2008, 9 years prior to this comic. He obviously does not read his email when they arrive in his inbox, and he now vows to at least get those e-mails from 9 years ago read.   As he further states in the caption below, he now (finally) begins to doubt his method for replying to e-mails, since his backlog now approaches 10 years. Some would probably say he should have found this out when his backlog approached 10 days, or at least when it reached a month.  A common technique for the productive members of the world is to batch reply to email instead of replying to each one individually as they come. The principle is that setting aside specific times to reply instead of always being ""on call"" gives the messages the attention they deserve while avoiding the urge to constantly check your email when you should be doing important work. Such a technique could be to check and answer all your emails once a day, or once a week, for instance and allocating a specific amount of time like one hour every day to do so. It is unlikely that somebody would wait years to start the task of checking emails, so obviously the time reserved per unit of time is way too short, if even existing. This would create a backlog of emails, that could soon be so large it would take years to catch up to the e-mail you just got right now.  Another technique for productive people is not to answer certain e-mails; if a subject really is important, the sender will send a reminder a few days later. (If he does not, the sender can be presumed to have solved the problem himself, saving lots of time on the receiver's side. Of course then you have to check your e-mails to realize if someone has sent a reminder.) Cueball has possibly used this technique on a friend's request, but became remorseful after nine years.  The title text is a reply to an email in which Rob wished to see the movie WALL-E, a film that came out in 2008, with Cueball during its opening weekend. However, the opening weekend is now far in the past, and yet Cueball doesn't realize it and trails off with ""are you still doing that, or...?"" Mentioning the release of a popular movie and then making it clear that it will soon be ten years ago that the movie came out, feels a lot like a hidden Comic to make one feel old, but it may be stretching it to include this directly in that category. But it is a technique often used by Randall, quite clearly in most of that category, for instance 891: Movie Ages.  A real (and useful[citation needed]) New Year's resolution would involve trying to answer his emails as they arrive (instead of spending any more time on years old emails), which would have avoided the mess he's currently in, and will stop it from getting worse in the future.  In this comic Cueball may represent Randall. He receives so many e-mail due to the xkcd comic that he may have a hard time going through them all. Then there is his what if? email, and possibly many more. Hopefully he has a separate e-mail for friends that wish to send him a request for going to the opening of new recent movie. On the about page on xkcd he does write the following for one of the e-mails he cites as contact:","[Megan and Cueball are walking along.] Megan: Did you have any New Year's Resolutions? Cueball: Gonna finally finish dealing with those emails from 2008.  [Caption below the panel:]  As my email backlog approaches 10 years, I'm starting to have doubts about my approach."
1873: Email Reply,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1873:_Email_Reply,email,"I would be honored, but I know I don't belong in your network. The person you invited was someone who had not yet inflicted this two-year ordeal upon you. I'm no longer that person.","Cueball is sitting at his desk writing an email. He is responding to Kevin, who sent him an email two years ago. Cueball is so far behind in responding to his email, he goes to great lengths to apologize for it. Instead of blaming the email culture which creates enormous quantities of messages, he blames himself for not keeping up. Failing to answer emails is a common symptom of general anxiety disorder, a problem which can snowball out of control as more and more emails go unread or unanswered.  At this point in the email, the reader assumes that Kevin's message really demanded a faster response, being personal and timely. Then Cueball reveals that the email is just the ubiquitous LinkedIn invitation. LinkedIn is a professional networking site notorious for inundating its users with emails inviting them to connect to other users (frequently people the user has little-to-no connection to), as well as any email contacts of their users whether or not they actually belong to LinkedIn themselves. Thus, an invitation to connect to LinkedIn is most often immediately deleted or ignored. A less socially anxious person who understands the irrelevance of such an email would not worry about failing to respond to such a request at all, and certainly would not pour his heart out in apology for failing to reply.  The title text continues this, suggesting that Cueball feels not even worthy of the original invitation.  One could interpret the letter as a passive-aggressive lashing out, but that does not seem to be in character for Cueball. Had the character worn a Black Hat though...  Cueball's difficulty in checking his email was previously addressed in 1783: Emails (trivia: the comic numbers 1783 and 1873 are anagrammatic).  This is the fourth comic within a year where Randall uses ""Kevin"" as a go-to-name, although it was half a year since last time in 1795: All You Can Eat. See details in that comics trivia.","[Cueball sits at a desk, typing on a laptop. The following message is displayed above him:]  Dear Kevin,  I'm sorry it's taken me two years to reply to your email. I've built up so much stress and anxiety around my email inbox; it's an unhealthy dynamic which is more psychological than technical. I've tried one magical solution after another, and as each one has failed, deep down I've grown more certain that the problem isn't email – it's me.  Regardless, these are my issues, not yours; you're my friend, and I owe you the basic courtesy of a response. I apologize for my neglect, and I hope you haven't been too hurt by my failure to reply.  Anyway, I appreciate your invitation to join your professional network on LinkedIn, but I'm afraid I must decline..."
1915: Nightmare Email Feature,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1915:_Nightmare_Email_Feature,email,"...just got back and didn't see your message until just now. Sorry! -- TIME THIS MESSAGE SAT HALF-FINISHED IN DRAFTS FOLDER: 3 days, 2 hours, 45 minutes.","Most modern email clients provide tools to help their users read, write and keep track of email efficiently. For instance, the user may receive a notification if the email body contains wording that suggests a file has been attached, but there is no actual attachment, in order to prevent forgetting to include the intended file in the email.  This comic suggests a similar feature, one which would inform not the user, but the recipient of the message, how long the email has been revised before being sent. This is an expansion of a common feature of collaboration tools used by law firms, and modern word processors such as Microsoft Word 2016.  Randall calls this his nightmare email feature, implying he spends too much time in revision of what should be simple email messages and that making himself, or worse - the recipient, aware of the actual time would make him anxious.  In the shown case it seems that the recipient of the shown e-mail had asked to their latest meeting and asks if he want to do it again this weekend. It then took 47 minutes to write a short reply in which he ends up saying he enjoyed the thing referred to. But alas he has no time this weekend. And then let the other suggest a possible time for a dinner... or something. (Of course there could be more to the email above the panel, but it seems to be a very short answer to another e-mail, and it increases the nightmare for the writer (and the impact of the joke) if this was all that was written in 47 minutes).  If the text had been written out in less than 2 minutes, it would not have been a problem. But it seemed the writer of this e-mail had to think a lot about how it was phrased. This could lead the recipient to wonder what took so long. Was it that he did not enjoy it, but ended up writing this to be nice? He only writes he is busy this weekend, thus not giving any reason as to why. And the last part gives him the possibility to also ""be busy"" on whatever time is suggested for dinner. Also whatever is very non committing. All this is also true if it had been written in 2 minutes, but then at least there would not have been time to think a lot about how the reply was phrased.  The title text describes a similar uncomfortable feature, which would inform the recipient how long a message has been sitting in the user's drafts folder, thus highlighting their procrastination as well as demonstrating that ""(...)didn't see your message until just now"" is a lie, or at least it was only true when the original message was written, and now three days later another message should have been written instead.  Randall has explored a related anxiety-inducing feature of instant messaging in 1886: Typing Notifications.","[A panel with a short email message, with the first line partly obscured by the top of the panel.

461: Google Maps,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/461:_Google_Maps,google_maps,Apparently Google assumes you're traveling during the ferry's normal operating hours. We lost two hours circling that damn lake (to say nothing of the Straw Man).,"Google Maps is a web mapping service application. Before smartphones with GPS mapping software were widespread and most people's printers hadn't yet run out of ink, it was common to print out directions to take with you on a trip. The web version of Google Maps has many features including a route planner. As sophisticated as early versions were, it occasionally gave suboptimal directions. For example, the directions may tell you to take an exit that, in reality, is unmarked. Directions also did not take time of day into account which would help in planning routes to avoid traffic or to make use of services such as a ferry.  The title text tells us that Cueball and his brother attempted to drive around the lake since they could not take the ferry and had an unfortunate run-in with the Straw Man (apparently waking him as the directions warned against).  Though no specific game or movie is referenced, steps 75 to 81 of the directions read like the plot of a horror film, a guide of a video game, or a role playing game. A straw man is another term for scarecrow, a common antagonist in both. Step 80 reads exactly like an old text adventure game's description of an area.  There are additional small jokes in the distance column of the directions:  This might be a reference to Google Maps' many easter eggs.","My road trip with my brother ran into trouble around page three of the Google Maps printout  [Google Maps printout.] ← 70.

When Google Maps was first starting out, the maximum zoom level a person could select went past the highest resolution imagery available in certain areas. When this happened, Google Maps would tile the message ""We're sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level"". When Cueball looks ""closely"" enough into Megan's eyes, he sees this same message.  The title text refers to a functionality of Google Maps that allows users to submit/update information about places on the map, such as business listings, monuments, etc. Such updates must be approved by Google before other users can see them. Apparently, Cueball has been repeatedly submitting 'WHERE YOU BROKE MY HEART' as a listing for his own house, so that Megan, who is now on the Google Maps team, will see those submissions.","[Cueball and Megan are talking, and Cueball is walking away from Megan.

Using the scroll wheel, the user can zoom out to see a larger area. Lena River is a river in Russia, flowing into the Arctic Ocean (with a large delta).  Clicking on the comic leads to an online Google Maps page showing the satellite imagery of the Lena Delta.  It appears that Cueball is simply trying to explore the world without leaving his laptop or purchasing an expensive game.  Alternatively, he may be playing Mapcrunch, this 'game' randomizes a street view location with the goal of finding the airport.   The title text states that he apparently somewhat still treats it as a game and that he has been on it for at least a decade.","[Cueball at a computer.] February 4th: Departed the mouth of the Lena River, heading south.

1204: Detail,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1204:_Detail,google_maps,"2031: Google defends the swiveling roof-mounted scanning electron microscopes on its Street View cars, saying they 'don't reveal anything that couldn't be seen by any pedestrian scanning your house with an electron microscope.'","Google Earth is a mapping software service provided by Google that allows people to view the Earth from above. If zoomed in to maximum magnification, one can obtain clear views of individual streets and homes.  An image's resolution is the smallest length detectable in that image. In terms of Google Earth, this refers to the real-life distance corresponding to one pixel in an aerial image. Randall points out that the level of detail in Google Earth's images has been increasing exponentially since its introduction, as aerial imaging technology improves and better ways of collecting the data are found. Each tick in the scale represents a resolution improvement by 1000 times.  In quantum mechanics, the Planck length is (in layman's terms) the smallest measurable distance, defined as approximately 1.6×10−35 meters, or around 1020 times smaller than the diameter of a proton. As the graph indicates, this may be called the ""resolution"" of the universe.  Randall extrapolates the exponential trend of Google Earth's increasing resolution, 'revealing' that by the year 2120 or so, Google Earth's resolution will approach and even possibly exceed the Planck length, an obviously fanciful and impossible idea. Current laboratory instruments cannot even get close to measuring the Planck length, barely able to reach the level of the atom. (Which, by the chart's prediction, will be surpassed by Google Earth at around 2040.)  Other comics exploring unwarranted extrapolation include 605: Extrapolating, 1007: Sustainable and 1281: Minifigs.  The title text refers to controversy that Google received at one point regarding their use of vehicle-mounted Street View cameras to take images of streets and houses, and how such photography could constitute an invasion of privacy. Google defended itself by stating that the cameras can see nothing more than a pedestrian walking by. Given the trendline in this comic however, Google would need to produce resolution in the nanometer range by 2031, which (using today's technology) would require the use of scanning electron microscopes. The same 'invasion of privacy' defense would obviously not work here, as 1) current scanning electron microscopes in labs can only be used with small specimens at very close range, and are completely unsuitable for observing something as large as a house or for observations from a passing car, and 2) most pedestrians are not equipped with scanning electron microscopes. [citation needed]","My Neighborhood's Resolution in: [A two-axis graph with years from 2000 to 2100 plotted on the x-axis and resolution from 1 meter to the Planck length plotted on a logarithmic scale on the y-axis.

Two trendlines are drawn on the graph; one is labeled ""Earth"" and remains constant at the Planck length over time; the other is labeled ""Google Earth"" and connects the aforementioned three points, extending upward in a straight line and approaching the Planck length around 2100. Both trendlines break up into question marks before the point they would intersect.]"
1803: Location Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1803:_Location_Reviews,google_maps,"Google and Yelp keep deleting my scathing reviews of the Mariana Trench, the Chernobyl reactor core, the jet stream, and the equator.","Many online advertising services and social media networks (like Google and Yelp, both mentioned in the title text, and for instance Facebook) allow users to leave reviews of stores, businesses and locations. For various reasons these sites often find themselves with pages dedicated to, as Randall puts it, ""places that really don't need reviews"" such as municipal works installations, government property, and natural landmarks. This naturally attracts both clueless people and lots of self-styled comedians leaving less-than-helpful comments on such review pages.   Randall is just poking fun at this phenomenon by inventing possible reviews for the (fictional) location Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility, depicted with a Google Maps-styled map page along with a series of so-called reviews. (There does exist a Canyon River located in Ontario/Canada and one in Washington/USA (the latter is a significant tributary to the Satsop River). Canada does not maintain nuclear weapons since 1984, so the launch site should be located in Washington).   See explanations for the 11 visible (out of 22) reviews in the table below. Of course those responsible for such a facility with nuclear missiles would not like the attention they would be getting in this way, especially not when one of the comments mentions a hole in the fence... Although this comic makes a joke about reviews it has chosen a very dangerous facility to joke about. See more about this under Politics below  In the title text Randall mentions that both Google and Yelp keep deleting his scathing reviews of several locations like the above. The questions is if they would have done it if they had not been so harsh... While Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility appears not to exist, the places/phenomena he lists in the title text certainly do, and are places that you either cannot or would not normally visit as destinations. Here below each ""location"" is explained. That the deletion of such reviews is real has been proven by this comic, as it also happened for those that (of course) posted these reviews on Google maps as a response to this comic.  Mariana Trench is the deepest area of the world's oceans, about 10,994 meters (36,070 ft) deep, located between Japan and Australia. The pressure in the Mariana Trench is about 1,086 bars, more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure of about 1 bar at sea level. Despite this enormous pressure some organisms live in the Mariana Trench. Humans can reach the ground only by special deep-sea submarines, like Jacques Piccard did in 1960 with the Bathyscaphe Trieste. See reviews for the Mariana Trench at Google Maps and Facebook.  The Chernobyl reactor core is the most dangerous part of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It is located in the North of Ukraine. In the reactor No. 4 there was a nuclear disaster that happened on 26 April 1986. It caused devastating damage and massive radioactive contamination. There is still a Chernobyl Exclusion Zone 30 kilometers around the power plant. See reviews for the Chernobyl power plant at Google Maps and Facebook.  Jet streams are a meteorologic phenomenon about 9 to 16 kilometers above the ground. A stream consists of air currents with speeds from 92 km/h (50 kn; 57 mph) to over 398 km/h (215 kn; 247 mph). Such jet streams are routinely used for reducing fuel usage for long distance plane travels. As it is a ribbon rather than a point, it could not have a single point on the map. Also, the jet stream fluctuates north and south; so even if it could be pinpointed, the location would be constantly changing.  The equator is, as with the jet streams, not a singular place but a circumference around the Earth. Reviewing the equator as a singular location is rather pointless, though there is a whole range of specific (and interesting) locations around the equator, with countries with tropical rainforest climate, which many people from European and North American countries struggle with. That said, most of the equator goes over water.  In the table the rating is given with the review. After that an explanation both of the rating and of the review is given. Notice that any or all of the reviews could be sarcastic or ""trolling"", as is fairly typical on the internet, especially for reviews given for such a location as this one. This table assumes all the reviews are played straight.   The decision to make a comic depicting a nuclear missile launch facility may not be entirely random, given Randall's mildly political mood lately. In particular, it could be due to the cold relationship between Russia and the United States at the time of this comics release. Two weeks prior to this comics release Russia Deploys Missile, Violating Treaty and Challenging Trump. This was less than a month after Donald Trump became president. Trump has been positive towards Vladimir Putin earlier, but after the violation USA condemned the new missile. That Randall was not in favor of Trump becoming president was made clear in 1756: I'm With Her. His predecessor Barack Obama even stated, before Trump was elected, that If Trump can't handle Twitter, then he can't handle nuclear codes. Randall has earlier mentioned the codes indirectly in 1242: Scary Names, where he mentions the Nuclear football, which is much more scary than the name... It is a year ago he finished a ""series"" of four comics in a short period about nuclear weapons with 1655: Doomsday Clock (see about the other comics at the bottom of that explanation). But it seems that recent events have made him think about it again, although he tries no to as made evident in 1796: Focus Knob.","[Inside the main panel there is a frame with a Google location map with the typical red pin stuck in the center of the map inside a large gray region of the map.

The one-minute preview, unofficially nicknamed ""2 Girls 1 Cup,"" is a viral video that became a well-known internet meme. It is therefore not surprising that only the input combination of x=2 and y=1 generates a significant number of search results, being 257 times as frequent as the runner-up, ""1 Girl 1 Cup.""  The cells in the table with zero hits are white. From 1 to 9 they are yellow, and above that they are orange - except the maximum, which is red. As the second largest count is below 10,000 (7503) and the maximum almost two million, it is impossible to say if the red color is reserved for the maximum or for any number above a given value, say from ten thousand or up to above a million hits.  The title text suggests other combinations like 1 girl to 10,000 cups (very large number of cups to one girl), 2 girls to (5+3i) cups (a complex number), 65536 girls to 65536 cups (216, the first integer that can't be represented as a two-byte unsigned integer), and finally 3 French hens and 2 turtle doves to 1 cup. All are phrases with apparently no search results.   The last phrase is a reference to the song The Twelve Days of Christmas. After the publication of this comic, the phrase has been cross-posted at various sites in order to generate search results and prove the statement in the title text wrong. The same has happened to other entries, as often happens shortly after Randall posts something regarding Google searches.","Google results for ""<x> cups <y> girls"" [There is a table with eight columns and eight rows. The cells are colored depending on the value in the cell.] [Above the tabel is the label for the columns:]  Cups  [To the left the label for the rows:] Girls [The number of cups and girls are not part of the cells in the table, but they have been included here below - also [Girls] is written only for clarity.]"

They just have developed an intuition which works in many situations. This intuition is shown here in the form of a diagram. In particular, the chart exposes the computer expert's secret ingredient: trial and error.  A flowchart is an organizational tool for showing process flow. A box is an instruction, a diamond indicates a question, and the arrows control the flow from one symbol to another. Other flowchart comics can be found here.  The title text is a sad admission that even knowing the procedure for how to fix the problem, many people will not follow it and still call their presumably more tech-savvy children.","Dear various parents, grandparents, co-workers, and other ""not computer people.""

The scales vary.}  <X> Bottles of Beer on the Wall [There are peaks at 1, 49, 73, and 99. A dip in the middle is marked ""They lose steam at 66."" After 99 is a steep dropoff. The largest peak is around 100,000 hits.]  I've Had <X> Boy/Girlfriends [Both lines descend at roughly the same rate from 1 to 10, although the boyfriend graph is smoother; the girlfriend graph has a small peak at 4 and a small dip at 6. The peaks are between 100,000 and 1,000,000 hits.]  I'm in <X>st/nd/rd/th Grade [The curve is a bell peaking at 7th grade and about 500,000 hits. A second line labeled ""Including Junior, Senior, etc."" follows the bell curve until the peak, then dips only slightly for 10th grade and resumes climbing.]  I Have a/an <X>-Inch Penis [The line ascends shallowly from 100,000 hits for 3 inches to a peak of 180,000 for 9 inches, then descends steeply to 20,000 for 13 inches.]  I'm a/an <X>-Cup [A has a few hundred thousand hits; the graph dips to a few thousand for C, peaks again around 100,000 for E, and then tails off.]  I'm <X> and Have Never Had a Boyfriend [The graph is mostly a simple bell, starting and ending around 300,000 hits for 13 or 21, but there is a sharp peak of 700,000 at 18 (well above the trend line).]  Drink <X> Glasses of Water a Day [There are barely any hits below 4 or above 12; between the two it rises steeply to about 1,000 hits, with a steep, narrow peak of 10,000 at 8.]  There Are <X> Lights [The graph descends smoothly from several hundred thousand hits for 1 to about 10,000 for 10, except for a peak of about 1,000,000 for 4.]  I Got <X> Problems [The plot is extremely jagged, with the largest peak of 10,000,000 hits at 99, another of 10,000 at 96, and 100 and 88.]  My IQ Is <X> [A smooth curve starts and ends at a few thousand hits for around 85 and around 170, with the peak at several tens of thousands for 140, but there are several prominent outliers: 100, 110, 133, and 142 are all around 100,000 hits, and 147 is around 1,000,000.]"
887: Future Timeline,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/887:_Future_Timeline,google_search,"Not shown: the approximately 30,000 identical, vaguely hysterical articles titled ""WHITE PEOPLE IN [THE US/BRITAIN] TO BECOME MINORITY BY [YEAR]!"", which came up for basically any year I put in.","This comic uses the same strategy as comic 715: Numbers, in which Randall uses Google to search for phrases and then charts the results. This one is charted as a timeline, whereas 715 was charted as line graphs. It is a list of things predicted or announced by anyone at any time (the ones you see on Google search using ""by the year..."" or similar statements).  ""2101 - War Was Beginning"" is a reference to the opening narration of video game Zero Wing; the same narration is famous for the internet meme ""All your base are belong to us"". As there are not any other out and out references in the comic, and the rest are actually results that you can find using Randall's methods, ""War Was Beginning"" was probably the only thing he got when he googled 2101 as well.  Certain events in this comic, e.g. ""Social Security stops running surplus"", are repeated multiple times. Also, certain bizarre events, like ""Apocalypse occurs"", or ""Flying cars reach market"", happen before rather plausible things, like ""HTML 5 Finished"". Certain events, like ""Japan is a robot-only country"" or ""Gillette introduces 14-blade razor"" may be related to the recurring theme 605: Extrapolating.  The title text is born of a recurring ""white people panic"" situation; scaremongers will predict white minority in the very near future in order to get the panicked racist people to pay attention to them (without actually using valid or accepted scientific measurements to back up these claims- panicked racist people don't exactly fact-check very much), while level-headed sociologists will usually come up with more distant, if not nonexistent, dates from their extrapolations.  This comic has similar features to 1413: Suddenly Popular, 1093: Forget, and 891: Movie Ages.  The only predictions for this period that came true are that the world population has surpassed 7 billion. Canada formally withdrew from the Kyoto protocol in December 2011, and its emissions in 2012 were 18% above 1990 levels (though its population had grown 26% and its GDP had grown 67% in that period). Sadly, homelessness is still a problem in Massachusetts. The prediction about GNU/Linux operating systems remains false; although Android (which is built on the Linux kernel) is currently the most dominant OS, it is not completely GNU/Linux, which remains an extreme minority on consumer devices. And so far as we're aware, the apocalypse has yet to occur.  New Horizons is to make its closest approach to Pluto in July 2015.[1] It was never intended to land on Pluto.  Android OS' market share was already 84.4% as of the third quarter of 2014, showing that both estimates were overly conservative.[2] Windows Phone continued to have less than 30% of iOS' market share.","THE FUTURE According to Google search results Events for each year determined by the first page of Google search results for the phrases:    ""By <year>""  ""In year""   ""By the year

979: Wisdom of the Ancients,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/979:_Wisdom_of_the_Ancients,google_search,All long help threads should have a sticky globally-editable post at the top saying 'DEAR PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURE: Here's what we've figured out so far ...',"This comic refers to a common experience that those trying to solve tech problems have. Typically, people search on Google to try to find solutions to the problem. Sometimes the solution can be found on a software program's website, but the most helpful solutions frequently come from discussions on message boards, particularly for more obscure problems. This is because the odds are rather high that someone else, years ago, had the same problem you're having and resolved it.  However, in this comic, Cueball is unable to find any mention of the problem he's currently facing except for one forum post about it that did not include the problem's solution. This is akin to finding an FAQ with questions but no answers.  The title is a satirical reference to the notion that the ""ancients,"" i.e. from thousands of years ago, possessed knowledge that has been lost to the centuries (such as exactly how Stonehenge was built), and that artifacts from those times do not fully divulge such knowledge. The fact that the ""ancient"" referred to in the comic is from 2003 (only 8 years before the comic was published) is an exaggeration of the feeling that the forum poster is lost to the sands of time, but in some sense this feeling is nonetheless true, since Cueball is unlikely to be able to contact her or him.   The title text is a suggestion to forums to be aware of the fact that people are likely going to come across such posts in the future and therefore to provide handy summaries of the most helpful conclusions of long threads for them, since combing through several false starts and failed attempts to resolve a problem can be quite tedious.  In 1722: Debugging the title text also mentions googling an error message, explaining what it means if you get zero results.  http://www.mirrorsoferis.com/forum/thread05232003a.html","[A poem is written outside and right justified along the left edge of the panel to the right.]    Never have I felt so close to another soul   And yet so helplessly alone   As when I Google an error   And there's one result   A thread by someone with the same problem   And no answer   Last posted to in 2003  [Cueball stands in front of his desk, having risen so the chair has moved away behind him.

1256: Questions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1256:_Questions,google_search,To whoever typed 'why is arwen dying': GOOD. FUCKING. QUESTION.,"Google, a rather popular internet search engine, has a feature known as autocomplete that guesses at search queries before they are fully typed out. These guesses are generally made based on popular searches by other people. From time to time, a particularly strange or hilarious one may be found, as is evidenced in this comic.  The largest pictured questions are: ""Why are there slaves in the bible"" and ""Why are there ants in my laptop"".  All of the questions in the comic are ""why"" questions, so many of them are predicated on false assumptions, such as ""Why are there pyramids on the moon"". All these questions and many more (33,171 in total) can be found in http://xkcd.com/why.txt.  Regarding the title text: in the Peter Jackson films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Arwen becomes sickly for unspecified reasons as the plot advances, apparently giving Aragorn a more personal reason to fight. The only explanation given is by Elrond, who says ""As Sauron's power grows, her [Arwen's] strength wanes."" This subplot is entirely absent from the original novels.  The tables below have been created so as to split the comic into almost entirely arbitrary blocks, which have then been identified with similarly arbitrary numbers.

Oh God, is this a WEBRING?","Google is a popular search engine. Google's searching algorithms are widely regarded as the most accurate and useful. If your search terms were sufficiently detailed, you will be able to find what you were looking for on the first page. Having to view the second page indicates your search terms were too vague or the answer to your query doesn't exist. Especially when the search results are a thousand or more items, only the very first results are mapping to the real idea of the user. The second page is not helpful for the issue.  Cueball, after failing to find his query in the first page of results, takes a curious peek at the second page. This is represented by a not-at-all subtle metaphor in which Cueball is about to wander into a sun-baked desert. According to the title text, he finds one vaguely relevant webpage, but it's over 17 years old.  The title text refers to webrings. Webrings consist of multiple websites that are connected together, usually with a common theme. They connect from one website to the next, eventually leading back to the starting site. They were popular in the 1990s as a way of boosting your search ranking, but newer algorithms in Google and other search engines are now detecting and penalizing web sites for such tactics. Webrings were also used in pre-google days to make it easy to find websites sharing a common theme, but since one site going down broke the ring, they were very inefficient. Seeing a webring means a site has not been updated since the mid 90s.","[Cueball in a desert standing before a rock.] Rock: Greetings, stranger. Rock: Whatever quest drives you, abandon it.

1444: Cloud,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1444:_Cloud,google_search,Cloud computing has a ways to go.,"Cueball and Megan are lying outside on the grass and looking up at the clouds. Cueball asks Megan what she thinks a particular cloud looks like, following the common human activity of pareidolia, or spotting apparent patterns where there are none (particularly in clouds).  Rather than responding with her own interpretation, Megan takes a picture of the cloud with her phone, and uses Google's Search by Image feature. In this feature, the user uploads an image rather than providing a keyword to search on, and is presented with suggestions about the subject of the original image. Google's search results reveal that the image Megan uploaded is most probably a photograph of a cloud. While indisputable, this does not address the fanciful dimension of Cueball's original question, and highlights the continuing limitations of artificial intelligence with respect to human imagination.  Google image search works by creating a mathematical model of the shapes and colors in the uploaded image, and matching this against images already in its index. Web page analysis then allows Google to guess at what the image is, based on the content of the pages where the matching images were found. Although apparently unimaginative, even humorously so, Google image search does recognize that the subject of Megan's photograph is a cloud, which is an achievement that has so far eluded programmers. This was the subject of 1425: Tasks.  If the term ""cloud computing"" is taken entirely literally, and purely in the context of this comic, then the title text merely comments that the processing of an image of a cloud for queries is not at an advanced state yet. It is really, however, a pun on cloud computing, which is a trendy term for the modern tendency of providing massive amounts of digital storage and distributed computing power over the Internet. In this context, the term ""cloud"" is a metaphor for the way the details of where or how the storage or processing is done are obscured from the user, as if it all takes place inside a cloud. In 2014, cloud computing as a commonly accessible service really is in its relative infancy, being a 21st-century phenomenon, although the concept goes back decades. Java was originally marketed in the 1990s by Sun Microsystems with the slogan ""the network is the computer"", and the mantra of technologies for distributed computing such as CORBA, EJB and SOAP was ""data first"" and ""the computer is the network"".[1]  In a way, every conceivable sense of the term cloud computing is utilized in Google's image search for Megan's cloud image. Cloud computing is also referenced in 908: The Cloud and 1117: My Sky.  It might be interesting to note that the month before, in September 2014, Google employees had published work on image recognition and pattern-enhancing algorithms. Originally conceived to allow better enlargements of small pictures and the objects contained in them, the process could be tweaked to overemphasize weak structures in pictures, leading to DeepDream images, which literally did start to ""see"" distinct, known structures (mostly dogs) even in random noise. This is rather similar to the pastime of looking for known objects in clouds.  Cueball and Megan are again seen cloudwatching in 1899: Ears.","[Cueball and Megan are lying outside on their backs.] Cueball: What do you think that cloud looks like?

1667: Algorithms,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1667:_Algorithms,google_search,"There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control.","An algorithm is a basic set of instructions for performing a task, usually on a computer. This comic lists some algorithms in increasing order of complexity, where complexity may refer to either computational complexity theory (a formal mathematical account of the computational resources – primarily computation time and memory space – required to solve a given problem), or the more informal notion of programming complexity (roughly, a measure of the number and degrees of internal dependencies and interactions within a piece of software).  At the simplest end is left-pad, or adding filler characters on the left end of a string to make it a particular length. In many programming languages, this is one line of code. This is possibly an allusion to a recent incident when NodeJS Package Manager angered a developer in its handling of a trademark claim. The developer unpublished all of his modules from NPM, including a package implementing left-pad. A huge number of programs depended on this third-party library instead of programming it on their own, and they immediately ceased to function.  Quicksort is an efficient and commonly used sorting algorithm.  Git is a version control program, i.e., software that allows multiple people to work on the same files at the same time. When someone finalizes (""commits"") their changes, the version control program needs to join the new content with the existing content. When more than one person has made overlapping changes at the same time, the process of figuring out how to join them is called merging, and the algorithm for it is anything but simple.  A self-driving car is an automobile with sensors and software built into it so that it can maneuver in traffic autonomously, i.e. without a human controller. Various companies have been working on such vehicles for many years now, and while they're further along now than would have been imaginable even a couple of years ago, we're still far away from the dream of hopping in a driver-less taxi and sitting back as the car itself navigates to where we want to be. Recently Randall has made several references to self-driving cars which has become a recurring topic on xkcd.  The Google Search backend is what enables you to type ""what the heck is a leftpad algorithm"" into your browser and have Google return a list of relevant results, including correcting ""leftpad"" to ""left-pad"", truncating ""what the heck is"" to simply ""what is"", and sometimes even summarizing the findings into a box at the top of the results. Behind all that magic is a way to remember what pages the Internet contains, which is just a mind-bogglingly large quantity of data, and an even more mind-numbingly complex set of algorithms for processing that data.  The last item is the punchline: a sprawling Excel spreadsheet built up over 20 years by a church group in Nebraska to coordinate their scheduling. Spreadsheets are a general end-user development programming technique, and therefore people use Excel for all sorts of purposes that have nothing to do with accounting (its original purpose), including one guy who made a role-playing game that runs in Excel; but even that doesn't approach the complexity that develops when multiple people of varying levels of experience use a spreadsheet over many years for the purpose of coordinating the schedule of several coordinated groups.  The scheduling of tasks over a group of resources (a.k.a. the nurse scheduling problem), while respecting the constraints set by each person, is a highly complex problem requiring stochastic or heuristic methods for its resolution. Here, the algorithm would be further complicated by being solved by inexpert users over a spreadsheet model without using engineering practices. The potential hyperbole here is in thinking that such combination of circumstances would produce complexity far over that required to drive a car or sort the public contents of the Internet. While most churches meet mainly on Sunday morning, scheduling of what happens during the service when (especially if there are multiple concurrent services) as well as Sunday School, church business meetings, and congregation-wide events all potentially needing to be scheduled on a particular Sunday morning, the need to find a solution very close to the best possible solution quickly becomes a dire need. Furthermore, with different members involved in a wide variety of activities within and outside of the church, and the classrooms available to the church on Sunday itself, (just scheduling the choir practice times to coordinate with everyone's work schedules is very possibly impossible, especially if two people share the same occupation, and one is the relief for the other,) can indeed be daunting. In addition, there would likely be assorted committee meetings and youth groups during the week.  In the title text, part of the spreadsheet's complexity is described as originating from different versions of the file for different programs. The words used like schism and sect are normally used in context of religions splitting into groups about differences in beliefs. In this case, the split seems to have been not over a theological issue, but about the use of open-source vs. proprietary software, disagreements about which are often compared to religious debates. Most likely, the schism being referred to is the East-West Schism of 1054.  The title text also implies that while trying to reconcile after the schism and to merge the two schedules they reinvented an alternative to Git within the spreadsheet itself, making the algorithms in place at least as complicated as that. Since most spreadsheet programs have a sort algorithm built in, that aspect is implied too, and left-padding could be compared to vamping on an introduction to a hymn. This would indicate that the other milestones of complexity are either included in the current version of the spreadsheet or are planned to be implemented.

1678: Recent Searches,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1678:_Recent_Searches,google_search,autoexec code posted by verified twitter users,"People often find answers to computer problems by searching on Google, which attempts to guess your intended search term based on your location, language and the characters you've already typed, placing its suggestions in a drop-down box beneath the input area. Here we see a list of search queries, each of which suggests the author is perversely misusing or overextending some computer technology. The overall impression is of someone technically sophisticated enough to shoot themselves in the foot, and who does not learn any larger lessons despite doing so repeatedly. The title text is another possible entry in this list.  The caption implies that from Randall's perspective, every computer he uses seems to be broken; he doesn't seem to realise this is because he's the one using them, not because the computers actually start off broken. (For similar themes see also these comics: 349: Success, 1084: Server Problem, 1316: Inexplicable and 1586: Keyboard Problems).

1773: Negativity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1773:_Negativity,google_search,[Google search] how do I block my lawn,"Cueball is going outside for some fresh air because he wants to escape the trolls of the Internet, which is known for hosting several hostile and unpleasant ideas and people. However, as he walks, some grass speaks up to insult him, and Cueball is upset to find that he hasn't escaped the negativity at all. (see 1749: Mushrooms which involves an unusual occurrence of a vocalizing angry mushroom).  The title text expands on this, with him searching Google for how to ""block the lawn"". Blocking someone refers to a standard setting on websites and online services that can prevent certain users from communicating with you, but it is as yet unknown how this would work for a lawn insulting you. This is made ironic by the fact he is using the Internet to find an Internet technique (blocking) on a non-Internet object, while at the start of the comic, he just wanted to escape the Internet.  The term ""blocking"" is actually used in lawn-care to refer to techniques where sunlight is restricted from reaching the lower parts of the grass stems and to persuade the root system to grow deeper into the soil.  The negativity Cueball meets on-line is likely due to the results of the recent 2016 United States presidential election and this one was released only three days before the U.S. Electoral College voted for Donald Trump to become the 45th president of the United States, and this was still a bit exciting as there where rumors/hopes that some of the electors would not vote for Trump. (But only two changed away from Trump!) That this is likely is further supported with other recent comics. The first of these 1761: Blame is almost a prequel to this one, as it is about being sad about what happens on-line. This comic here was thus the second sad comics following the election, culminating shortly after his inauguration with a comic simply titled 1790: Sad. (See more on other depressive comic in this trivia.)  Later in 1802: Phone, Cueball cannot go outside for a walk without bringing his phone as he cannot stand to be disconnected from his feed, which is the exact opposite of what he tries in this comic. Although in the title text he does try to disconnect, he then finds that this is also bad because it leads to social isolation.","[Cueball walking on grass] Cueball: It's nice to get outside, away from the pain and negativity of the internet,  [Cueball stops walking] Cueball: And just enjoy the cool breeze and the grass under my feet.

325: A-Minus-Minus,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/325:_A-Minus-Minus,online_reviews,You can do this one in every 30 times and still have 97% positive feedback.,"Black Hat is trying to make the world a weirder place by shipping bobcats to his eBay buyers. Ordinarily, negative feedback is used to warn future buyers about sellers that ship broken products or post misleading listings. In this case, the unfortunate buyer is leaving feedback warning future buyers that Black Hat ships bobcats instead of the actual products, though ""would not buy again"" seems to be a rather feeble response to the replacement. This appears to have been a continuing project, as Cueball receives random packages a year and a half later (576: Packages). Four years later, it is shown that you can blackmail Black Hat into not sending you a bobcat (837: Coupon Code). This comic is also referenced in a popular Amazon review for Randall Munroe's book, What If: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.  Like the weak ""would not buy again"" comment is a play on the stock ""would buy again"" comment often found in positive eBay feedback, the title ""A-Minus-Minus"" is a play on the frequent comment ""A++"".  That in turn, sometimes with varying numbers of pluses, seems to be an easy way people use to pad the end of an eBay comment field to the maximum 80 characters. It's also a reference to jokes in which exceptionally good schoolwork is graded with extra pluses after an A+ (and exceptionally bad work is graded with large numbers of minuses after an F). And finally, it's also a subtle reference to the Futurama episode A Big Piece of Garbage; at one point in that episode, Wernstrom, as an act of petty revenge, gives Farnsworth ""the worst grade imaginable"": an A-minus-MINUS.   The title text is about a flaw in eBay's feedback system: You can intentionally do nasty things to your buyers and get very bad reviews, but still have overall high feedback scores as long as you don't do it too often. (See also 937: TornadoGuard, which shows a different flaw in the concept of averaging reviews—namely that five-star reviews for aesthetic qualities are weighted equally to one-star reviews for major functional deficits—and 1098: Star Ratings, which addresses the topic as well.) These reviews would be disregarded by future customers as well for their weirdness.",[Black Hat is packing a bobcat into a box; Megan stands beside him.]  Megan: What are you doing?

937: TornadoGuard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/937:_TornadoGuard,online_reviews,The bug report was marked 'could not reproduce'.,"This is a comic with a take on an application store - the most common app stores are for iPhones and Android devices. App stores take all the reviews and average the ratings for the overall star rating.   In this comic, we see why this is sometimes a bad idea, especially with something as important as an app called TornadoGuard that should warn the user if a tornado is approaching. In this case, there are three 5 star reviews about the stability and user interface features of the app, left by users who actually never experienced its core functionality (simply because they never used it in a place where a tornado appeared since they got it); however, the only review related to whether the app really works is given the same weight as the others, and sadly for that user the TornadoGuard app failed in alerting the user to an upcoming tornado. Tornadoes are a recurring subject on xkcd. Also see future comic 1098: Star Ratings and 1754: Tornado Safety Tips.   The title text is a call back to 583: CNR. It is a note from the developer's bug report, which said they could not reproduce the error. Of course, they could only reproduce such a failure if there were a tornado coming towards their area. This is a fairly rare situation, especially in certain areas of the world. This lack of suitable testing conditions explains why the actual tornado-prediction portion of their code appears to be faulty.","[The comic is a single panel which resembles a reviews page for a mobile phone application.

958: Hotels,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/958:_Hotels,online_reviews,"Rating: 1/5. Room filled to brim with semen, and when front desk clerk opened mouth to talk, bedbugs poured out.'","In this comic, Black Hat is putting bad reviews on all the hotels he has stayed at and likes and wants to stay in again, in order to lower demand for said hotel. He is simultaneously putting good reviews on bad hotels to steer other people there so there are more vacancies at good hotels. He claims he is not enough influence to put the good hotels out of business.  The Tragedy of the commons ""is a dilemma arising from the situation in which multiple individuals, acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen."" This situation is not a complete example of this concept as Black Hat is the only one doing it. He understands, however, that if others do it, it would apply. (Another example is what would happen using a certain strategy in the game Oregon Trail)  In the last frame, Black Hat references the invisible hand which is the term economists use to describe the self-regulating nature of the marketplace. Black Hat appears to be taking advantage of this invisible hand by cutting it with a knife and eating it.  The title text is an example of Black Hat's negative review, which in itself is a surrealist joke about the hotel. A very believable set of complaints about an awful hotel is that the ""Room filled to brim with bedbugs, and when front desk clerk opened mouth to talk, semen poured out"". However instead, the objects of focus are reversed, creating a ridiculous scenario for the reader to enjoy.","[Cueball is sitting at a desk with a laptop, looking at a review website] Cueball: What's with this negative review? You liked that hotel. Black Hat: I have a script that posts a bad review for every hotel I stay at. It reduces demand, which means more vacancies and lower prices next time.  Cueball: What if the place sucks? Black Hat: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.  Cueball: You punish companies you like! Black Hat: The odds of my review putting a hotel out of business are negligible. Cueball: If we all did that the system would collapse! Black Hat: Doesn't affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.  Cueball: That's not even the tragedy of the commons anymore. That's the tragedy of you're a dick.

1036: Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1036:_Reviews,online_reviews,"I plugged in this lamp and my dog went rigid, spoke a sentence of perfect Akkadian, and then was hurled sideways through the picture window. Even worse, it's one of those lamps where the switch is on the cord.","Cueball and Megan are shown shopping for lamps. In the first part of the comic (only first frame) it is at a time before online reviews could be looked up on a smartphone. They spot a lamp they like, check the price and agree to buy, end of story.  But the rest of the comic shows how difficult shopping has become after reviews have become easily accessible on smartphones while standing in the store. And now this takes up the final three panels, with the result that no lamps have been acquired and they decide to sit in the dark, using the claim that their living room looks fine in the dark to avoid buying a very expensive lamp which is the only one with perfect reviews (like 100% with 5 stars out of 5).   When shopping for anything via reviews, whether it be electronics or even something as simple as lamps like the comic demonstrates, one negative review can spoil a lot of positive reviews. That hits home even more if the review is specific, because humans attach more weight to anecdotes and specific stories. This comic points out the absurdity of paying attention to those reviews, by making the negative review itself absurd (a lamp making your cats go deaf and interfering with your taste buds would imply, at the very least, anomalous radiation, and would not be on store shelves long before some kind of serious recall).   The second part of the comic starts out normal. For the lamp Cueball think is pretty Megan finds lots of negative reviews which implies the product really isn't good after all, and it was even that specific brand of lamps in general that was to be avoided. But then the proceeds to get more and more absurd all the way to the title text. Cueball is for instance looking at  a lamp who someone thinks looks like a uterus. As normal people do not really know how a uterus looks like, and if Cueball did not find this so himself, he should ignore one persons comment. On the other hand reading such a statement will maybe make you think of a uterus every time you see the lamp. So now it may be best not to buy it, but had he not read the comment it might have been a fine lamp for him.  In the final frame Cueball has found a Swiss lampmaker with perfect reviews, but her lamps are very expensive, the most cheap are staring at 1,300 francs. Swiss francs are the units of currency used in Switzerland. In 2012 when the comic was released a Swiss franc was a little more worth than one dollar (1.1$ to a Swiss Franc) making the cheapest lamp go for not much less than US$1450. For comparison, US$15 can get one a decent lamp at IKEA. Furthermore the lampmaker lives in the Swiss Alps and can only be reached via a ski lift. This either indicated that transportation will be very expensive on top of the high starting price or it may even indicate that they will have to go to the lampmaker personally to either acquire a lamp or maybe just to check out that they really do not look like a uterus or other parts of the human reproductive system...  In the title text, the language spoken by the dog, Akkadian, is an extinct Semitic language that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia.  Even if the dog actually did speak a sentence of perfect Akkadian, the chance that the owner would be able to recognize it as such is negligible. But apart from that the dog first went rigid and after delivering the line it was hurled out the picture window. The final joke it that the worst part of this lamp, was not the above mentioned crazy effects on the dog, but that the lamp had, completely normally, the switch on the cord, as opposed to having it on the body of the lamp. A production argument about where to place such a switch, leading to someone getting fired, was part of the joke in 1741: Work.","[Cueball and Megan stand in a store looking at a lamp that Cueball points at on a table in front of them.

1098: Star Ratings,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1098:_Star_Ratings,online_reviews,"I got lost and wandered into the world's creepiest cemetery, where the headstones just had names and star ratings. Freaked me out. When I got home I tried to leave the cemetery a bad review on Yelp, but as my hand hovered over the 'one star' button I felt this distant chill...","This comic deals with the idea that user-generated online star ratings are usually heavily biased towards the best possible rating (five stars).  Because we instinctively read a rating of five stars as five points, a three star rating (3/5) seems like a good rating. However, as the lowest possible rating is typically one star, and not zero stars, a 3/5 is the median, and is equivalent to 10/20 - not a great rating.   Furthermore, since ratings are more likely to be given by people who fall onto one of the extremes (either loved or hated the product), there is a tendency for ratings to be skewed either high or low. Fake reviews are also a factor that often push an aggregate score higher, although this is not addressed in the comic.  For these reasons, Randall suggests a way to read these ratings, which is to consider the four star rating the median value (""OK""), and everything below as a ""crap"" rating.  See also: 937: TornadoGuard, another comic about star ratings.  No product is so perfect that every user will give it five stars. So the only explanation for a five star rating is that only a few users have voted, maybe only one.  The title text may refer to the folkloric practice of attributing a feeling of a chill to someone walking on your future grave. When Randall is back home he would like to give a bad rating on Yelp — a corporation that operates an ""online urban guide"" — and hovering his hand over the 'one star' button, he was just 'walking' over the rating on his own future grave.  Another possible explanation for the title text is that the headstones are from people that gave the cemetery low-star ratings and were then murdered, having their given ratings displayed in the headstones. This in turn would explain the chill Randall feels before clicking the one-star button.",Understanding online star ratings:  5 stars: [Has only one review] 4.5 stars: Excellent 4 stars: OK 3.5-1 star: Crap.
1803: Location Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1803:_Location_Reviews,online_reviews,"Google and Yelp keep deleting my scathing reviews of the Mariana Trench, the Chernobyl reactor core, the jet stream, and the equator.","Many online advertising services and social media networks (like Google and Yelp, both mentioned in the title text, and for instance Facebook) allow users to leave reviews of stores, businesses and locations. For various reasons these sites often find themselves with pages dedicated to, as Randall puts it, ""places that really don't need reviews"" such as municipal works installations, government property, and natural landmarks. This naturally attracts both clueless people and lots of self-styled comedians leaving less-than-helpful comments on such review pages.   Randall is just poking fun at this phenomenon by inventing possible reviews for the (fictional) location Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility, depicted with a Google Maps-styled map page along with a series of so-called reviews. (There does exist a Canyon River located in Ontario/Canada and one in Washington/USA (the latter is a significant tributary to the Satsop River). Canada does not maintain nuclear weapons since 1984, so the launch site should be located in Washington).   See explanations for the 11 visible (out of 22) reviews in the table below. Of course those responsible for such a facility with nuclear missiles would not like the attention they would be getting in this way, especially not when one of the comments mentions a hole in the fence... Although this comic makes a joke about reviews it has chosen a very dangerous facility to joke about. See more about this under Politics below  In the title text Randall mentions that both Google and Yelp keep deleting his scathing reviews of several locations like the above. The questions is if they would have done it if they had not been so harsh... While Canyon River Nuclear Launch Facility appears not to exist, the places/phenomena he lists in the title text certainly do, and are places that you either cannot or would not normally visit as destinations. Here below each ""location"" is explained. That the deletion of such reviews is real has been proven by this comic, as it also happened for those that (of course) posted these reviews on Google maps as a response to this comic.  Mariana Trench is the deepest area of the world's oceans, about 10,994 meters (36,070 ft) deep, located between Japan and Australia. The pressure in the Mariana Trench is about 1,086 bars, more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure of about 1 bar at sea level. Despite this enormous pressure some organisms live in the Mariana Trench. Humans can reach the ground only by special deep-sea submarines, like Jacques Piccard did in 1960 with the Bathyscaphe Trieste. See reviews for the Mariana Trench at Google Maps and Facebook.  The Chernobyl reactor core is the most dangerous part of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It is located in the North of Ukraine. In the reactor No. 4 there was a nuclear disaster that happened on 26 April 1986. It caused devastating damage and massive radioactive contamination. There is still a Chernobyl Exclusion Zone 30 kilometers around the power plant. See reviews for the Chernobyl power plant at Google Maps and Facebook.  Jet streams are a meteorologic phenomenon about 9 to 16 kilometers above the ground. A stream consists of air currents with speeds from 92 km/h (50 kn; 57 mph) to over 398 km/h (215 kn; 247 mph). Such jet streams are routinely used for reducing fuel usage for long distance plane travels. As it is a ribbon rather than a point, it could not have a single point on the map. Also, the jet stream fluctuates north and south; so even if it could be pinpointed, the location would be constantly changing.  The equator is, as with the jet streams, not a singular place but a circumference around the Earth. Reviewing the equator as a singular location is rather pointless, though there is a whole range of specific (and interesting) locations around the equator, with countries with tropical rainforest climate, which many people from European and North American countries struggle with. That said, most of the equator goes over water.  In the table the rating is given with the review. After that an explanation both of the rating and of the review is given. Notice that any or all of the reviews could be sarcastic or ""trolling"", as is fairly typical on the internet, especially for reviews given for such a location as this one. This table assumes all the reviews are played straight.   The decision to make a comic depicting a nuclear missile launch facility may not be entirely random, given Randall's mildly political mood lately. In particular, it could be due to the cold relationship between Russia and the United States at the time of this comics release. Two weeks prior to this comics release Russia Deploys Missile, Violating Treaty and Challenging Trump. This was less than a month after Donald Trump became president. Trump has been positive towards Vladimir Putin earlier, but after the violation USA condemned the new missile. That Randall was not in favor of Trump becoming president was made clear in 1756: I'm With Her. His predecessor Barack Obama even stated, before Trump was elected, that If Trump can't handle Twitter, then he can't handle nuclear codes. Randall has earlier mentioned the codes indirectly in 1242: Scary Names, where he mentions the Nuclear football, which is much more scary than the name... It is a year ago he finished a ""series"" of four comics in a short period about nuclear weapons with 1655: Doomsday Clock (see about the other comics at the bottom of that explanation). But it seems that recent events have made him think about it again, although he tries no to as made evident in 1796: Focus Knob.","[Inside the main panel there is a frame with a Google location map with the typical red pin stuck in the center of the map inside a large gray region of the map.

1869: Positive and Negative Reviews,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1869:_Positive_and_Negative_Reviews,online_reviews,"This restaurant is great! I was feeling really sick, but then I ate there and felt better!","The comic shows customer reviews from people who purchased a made-up sports drink multi-pack containing twelve 20 oz (591 mL) bottles. The people who gave negative reviews are Merlin (the wizard from the legends of King Arthur) and B. Button (from the short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and its film adaptation). Merlin remembers the future; in the T. H. White novel series The Once and Future King, he was born at the wrong end of time and has to live backwards. Benjamin Button was born with the physical appearance of an old man and grows younger as time progresses. In this comic, they apparently perceive time backwards: Merlin was thirsty then he drank the SmartQuench 9000, but he perceived it as drinking and then becoming thirsty. Benjamin Button was dehydrated then drank 3 bottles and got better, but perceived it the other way around.  Particles of matter can have a positive or negative electric charge. Particles have associated antiparticles with opposite charge. For example electrons are negatively charged particles and their antiparticles are positrons, which are positively charged. Antiparticles can be interpreted as if they were the associated particle moving backward in time. Applying that interpretation to customer reviews gives the caption of the comic: positive reviews from people traveling backward in time are negative reviews (the ""antiparticles"" of positive reviews).  The caption seems to say that there are only positive experiences—some going forward, some backward in life. However, Randall gives an example in the title text of a positive review which is actually about a negative experience by a person traveling backward in time (the person ate at a restaurant then got sick). The conclusion is that there are both positive and negative events, but the way they are perceived depends on both the event and whether one sees it going forward or backward in time.","[A picture with four small bottles and a larger one is shown.

This comic proposes a new structure for defining all blogs by a fractal of blogs.

134: Myspace,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/134:_Myspace,social_networking,"It's like they got together and said 'what do we miss most from the internet in 1998? that's right, embedded MIDI!'","Some websites, not long after the page finishes loading, suddenly play a song. It's annoying to the person visiting the site and to others who are nearby, so it will attract a lot of unwanted attention, especially if the song is played at a loud volume. Compounding this would be the possible inappropriateness of the song that is suddenly playing.  The five seconds to stop the music (finding the ""pause""/""stop"" button, muting the computer audio...) is too long in such an incident.  Since MySpace allows wide customization for members pages, many users have embedded music players that auto-run when the page is visited.  The title text refers to the fact that old pages, back in the late 1990s, used embedded MIDI files. MIDI files may have terrible sound quality (while lossless, it is limited in the amount of sounds that can be reproduced), but, more importantly, MIDI files that are embedded in the page would not only play automatically, but also have no way to stop playing. The viewer would have to leave the website or externally mute the audio.","[Computer screen showing a myspace page.] Oh man, you and everyone in earshot are gonna love the first five seconds of this song!"
146: Join Myspace,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/146:_Join_Myspace,social_networking,I really shouldn't abuse that power so heavily.,"This comic refers to the 1980s TV-comicseries (and Greeting Card subjects) ""Care Bears,"" in which various cuddly bears in rainbow colors go on missions to save the world. The characters' ultimate weapon is the ""Care Bear Stare,"" in which the Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer that could bring care and joy into the target's heart.  ""Myspace"" is the social networking site myspace.com. Cueball is convincing Black Hat to create an account at this networking site, but Black Hat isn't interested. Then, when Black Hat gets annoyed by Cueball's persuasions, he activates his ""carebearstare,"" thus overthrowing Cueball's request to be friends only.  One possible explanation for Black Hat's odd choice of weaponry is that he is mocking Cueball. The phrase ""Please? I'll friend you"" sounds like an average preschooler's coaxing (along the lines of ""Please? I'll be your friend!""). Therefore, Black Hat may feel that Cueball's remarks seem childish and deserve a childish backlash.  On a nostalgic note, considering the state of social media in the 2010s, Black Hat is just really good at foreshadowing.  In the title text, Black Hat reflects that he uses his carebearstare power too much, possibly as a form of apology to Cueball.","[Cueball is talking to Black Hat.] Cueball: Dude, you should get on MySpace. Black Hat: Eh, I don't think so.  Cueball: C'mon. There's no real reason not to except snobbiness. It's the new social scene. Black Hat: I know. I'm just not interested.  Cueball: Please? I'll friend you. Black Hat: Carebearstare. Cueball: What?  [Black Hat shoots a rainbow colored ray from his chest - the Care Bear Stare. It throws Cueball to the edge of the panel, pinned to the wall.]"
239: Blagofaire,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/239:_Blagofaire,social_networking,Things were better before the Structuring and the Levels.,"Facts become distorted as time moves forward. What do we know about the Elizabethan times? They spoke strange English. What will 400 years from now think of the first twenty years of the Internet? Crazy people said crazy things online. Will we even say ""online"" 400 years from now? Won't the internet be everywhere, and everyone on it all the time in their retinal implants that being ""offline"" will seem absurd?  Particular facts that this reinactor seems to have confused are:  ""Ren Faire"" is short for ""Renaissance Faire"", described as ""an outdoor weekend gathering, usually held in the United States, open to the public and typically commercial in nature, which emulates a historic period for the amusement of its guests.""   While Cory Doctorow is not in this comic, the character is cosplaying him. This comic inspired several xkcd readers to give Cory Doctorow a red cape and goggles when he won the 2007 EFF Pioneer Award. Cory Doctorow's balloon is featured in 482: Height.  The title Blagofaire might be an amalgamation between Blogosphere, Medieval Faire, and Blag, Randall's way of referencing his blog.  The title text is probably the future cosplayer referring to the state of the future internet, indicating some organizational structure that constrains and stratifies it, and his preference for what he perceives as the wild and unfettered internet of the past.  The ""festival"" the cosplayer references is most likely a reference to the blogger reenactment festivals mentioned in 771: Period Speech.","Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Hey, it worked! Cueball: What? Who are you? Man in Red Cape and Goggles: I'm from the distant future. Cueball: Wow. Hi!  Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Are you a blogger? I play one of you at our festivals! Cueball: Huh? Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Like the Ren faires of your time — I do reenactments.  Man in Red Cape and Goggles: We relive the days when the internet was new and free. The days of risky sharing, Slashdot, the Myspace music renaissance. The generation's finest minds meeting on comment threads, battling roving bands of trolls, and holding the great dialogues of the age!  Cueball: Is that how you— Man in Red Cape and Goggles: We're fuzzy on some details. Did bloggers really wear red capes and goggles and blog from high-altitude balloons? Cueball: No! Cueball: Well, Cory Doctorow does. But nobody else."
300: Facebook,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/300:_Facebook,social_networking,"Here, I'll put my number in your cell pho -- wait, why is it already here?'","This comic approaches how Social networks have changed the ways of human interaction. With everyone placing their personal interests on their Facebook profile pages, it has become fairly easy to gather a lot of information about people. In the comic, Cueball uses this information to his advantage: He ascertained Megan's musical preferences beforehand in order to create the illusion of their sharing mutual interests. Megan is led to believe that he is like-minded, thus making it easier for Cueball to persuade her into having sex with him. Here the comic takes at the fact that many people use Facebook as a hunting ground for sexual contacts.  Apparently, Megan did not only mention her favorite bands in her profile, but also her preferred sex position. This can be read as a sideswipe at what intimate details some people are willing to share on the internet. Although mentioning sexual preferences is hyperbolic here.  Megan's taste in both fields can be regarded as outside the mainstream.  Regina Spektor and The Polyphonic Spree are representatives of the indie pop genre. The Wheelbarrow (NSFW) features the man standing behind the woman and holding her legs, while she props up in a wheelbarrow-like position. The retrograde variant has the woman facing upwards. Unusual sex positions are also mentioned in comics 414: Mistranslations and 487: Numerical Sex Positions.  The title text suggests that Cueball did not stop at reading Megan's interests on her Facebook profile, but also obtained her phone number and placed it in his phone. It is implied that some of the ""mildly sleazy"" uses of Facebook can border on the verge of stalking. When Megan discovers the number, she may realise this and stay clear of Cueball...","Mildly sleazy uses of Facebook, part 14: Looking up someone's profile before introducing yourself so you know which of your favorite bands to mention Cueball: Favorite bands? Hmm... Cueball: Maybe Regina Spektor or the Polyphonic Spree. Megan: Whoa, those are two of my favorites, too! Megan: Clearly, we should have sex. Cueball: Okay! My favorite position is the retrograde wheelbarrow. [Megan raises arms.] Megan: Ohmygod, mine too!"
355: Couple,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/355:_Couple,social_networking,"Facebook defines relationships. 'Yeah, we would have broken up last night, but the net connection was down.'","It's hard to know when you are in a relationship in modern times. In olden days you might fancy a girl, and then ask her father if you might court her, and if he granted his permission you would be a couple. Today, that kind of structure and formality is terrifyingly antiquated; as a result we don't have any of the straightforward cues.  This comic suggests that ""making it Facebook official"", which means asserting the existence of a romantic relationship on Facebook by setting one's status to ""In a relationship"", has recently become a way to define when you are a couple. Cueball would like to do it, probably after having sex for the first time with his love interest, to get confidence in his relationship and/or show it off to his friends. Because his love interest isn't so sure about that relationship, or doesn't like to formalize it and prefers to enjoy without thinking too much about it, he suggests a compromise: using the ""It's complicated"" status instead. And he does so with a phrasing very reminiscent of a formal way to propose to marry someone (""Will you be my wife?"").  The title text takes it a step further, suggesting that Facebook has become the only reliable way to know about relationships — even so, without access to Facebook, relationships can't evolve.","[Cueball and Megan in bed.] Cueball: So is this it? Are we a couple now?  Megan: I just don't know. I like this. I just... don't know.  [Silence.]  Cueball: Well will you be my ""it's complicated"" on Facebook?"
574: Swine Flu,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/574:_Swine_Flu,social_networking,"Bad flu epidemics can hit young adults hardest because they provoke their powerful immune systems into overreaction, so to stay healthy spend the next few weeks drunk and sleep-deprived to keep yours suppressed.","Swine flu is a strain of the flu which can be transmitted from pigs to humans. In 2009, it was the origin of the Pandemic H1N1/09 virus, which most news stations called either ""H1N1"" (the subtype name) or ""swine flu"". Because of the ambiguous name given to it and the somewhat hazy description of the transmittal process and dangers to humans, many people were concerned about the virus in ways that weren't going to be threats. This comic pokes a bit of fun at the overreaction by users on Twitter.  Randall (or someone else) seems to have created Twitter accounts for all referenced handles (that may not have already existed). Some of the handles continue their interactions with each other in later tweets.  Skeeve37 is a self-described hypochondriac. The tweet exemplifies the general populace's over-concern with the ""animal themed"" pandemics. Similarly after the bird flu scare, people avoided eating chicken.  Hanneloreec is a self-described ""young lady who is concerned about many things"". She is a reoccurring character in the webcomic Questionable Content by Jeph Jacques, who also manages her twitter handle.  Paulyshorefan's tweet is a reference to the flash game ""Pandemic 2"", in which players try to create a disease that infects the whole world. Madagascar is the most difficult country to infect, as it only has 1 port and often closes it at the slightest hint of an infection. The difficulty of infecting Madagascar has caused it to become a meme.  CrackMonkey74's tweet is a parody of viral Christian(?) messages that say that current tragedies are God's punishment, despite the fact that the Bible says that the end is not yet to come. More specifically, Crackmonkey74 blames the ACLU, lesbians (a reference to the current culture wars that give big press towards proponents of same-sex marriage against fundamentalist Christians), 9/11 (the day when the Twin Towers fell, causing controversy on whether Muslim terrorists crashed their planes on the towers or whether the government staged this by purposefully demolishing the towers) and nanobots (possibly a reference towards the highly promising but still relatively not understood field of nanotechnology, plus another reference towards the phrase ""playing God"").  Twilight7531's tweet implies that she got a bone fracture which ended up protruding from her arm. However, she seems to lack medical knowledge (or intelligence in general, given that her name carries both something that may be a reference toward the infamous Twilight books and a ""gimmicky"" naming scheme (7531 has the numerals of every odd number that is less than 9)), so she is worried that her fracture is actually swine flu (though how she can be typing with a broken arm is confusing).  Wigu's tweet is a reply towards Untoward's. Given the context, Untoward seems to have ""gotten intimate"" with a pig (since syphilis is a venereal disease). Given the fact that Untoward got sick because of a pig, Untoward seems to have concluded that he got swine flu.  The last comment by 2011Seniorsrule references a medical paper published by the journal The Lancet, in which it is proposed that autism is caused by vaccination. Since then, the paper was partially retracted in 2004, and fully retracted in 2010 because of conflicts of interest. The entire incident has been defined as the MMR vaccine controversy. This stance has still been seen since the retraction of the paper, and still holds some popularity. The most famous figure in support of it is Jenny McCarthy.  Also, fear of germs is common among autistic people, so ""licking an autistic kid"" would be a difficult and possibly painful experience.   The title text refers to the common notion that young adults are hard-drinking individuals who get little sleep.

624: Branding,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/624:_Branding,social_networking,"Actually, 'RSS&M' is kinda catchy.","This comic pokes fun at web sites (adult-themed sites in particular) which try to inflate their popularity by comparing themselves to other popular online services.  The strip shows four such advertisements that appear to Cueball as he browses the Internet.  Adblock is a browser extension which prevents advertisements from being displayed. Presumably Cueball normally browses the Internet with Adblock enabled, and thus would not see any of these ads.  The first advertises a website that brands itself as the ""Facebook of sex"". Because Facebook is ubiquitous, this is probably a good branding idea. Facebook is known to most users and connotes an easy-to-use platform where it's very easy to find people, chat with them, share pictures, etc. For someone looking for sex, this would probably seem like a good site to use. There are, in fact, sites that use this branding in their advertisements and/or their user interface which is likely what inspired Randall to write this comic. Cueball sighs and moves on, probably having seen this kind of ad many times already.  The second brands itself as ""Twitter for 18+ singles"". It is a similar but seemingly invented ad which again plays on the ubiquity and popularity of Twitter. Twitter being a (generally) public chat forum which limits posts to 140 characters is still popular enough to get some attention and make someone think about going to the site.  Sending messages to the world in 140 characters or less might be somewhat less of a versatile platform than Facebook for chatting with other singles, but still perhaps viable. Cueball notes that it is becoming more and more popular to brand adult sites by comparing them to popular non-adult sites.  This third takes a turn for the unusual, branding itself as ""Google Reader for S&M"". Google Reader is a now-defunct platform that allows users to aggregate web feeds such as RSS feeds into one place for convenience. The service is notably less well-known and popular than Facebook or Twitter, and given that it doesn't directly link you with other people, doesn't have the same connotation of allowing you to connect with others. Perhaps it would be a site that allowed you to aggregate various fan fictions, blogs, or other written works relating to S&M. However, Cueball is surprised such a site would exist.  The final ad brands itself as a ""GitHub for lesbians"". GitHub is a website that allows developers to collaborate on software projects using the Git revision control system. The concept is absurd — GitHub has a specialized function unrelated to anyone's gender or orientation, and it's barely a social network at all; the usefulness or appeal of such a system made specific to lesbians is not apparent. Cueball is surprised and possibly even intrigued by this last ad.  The title text relates to the third panel.  RSS is a technology involved in Google Reader. RSS&M is a portmanteau of RSS and S&M.  This is a possible way for the third web site to brand itself.","Browsing without adblock [Cueball is sitting at a computer.] [Pop-up window with red background.] The Facebook of SEX! Click now! Cueball: Sigh. *Close*  [Pop-up window with green background.] Twitter for 18+ singles! Join today!

655: Climbing,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/655:_Climbing,social_networking,Where did you even get this wall? Return it there and stand it back up right now.,"This comic makes fun of a certain type of images very common on the internet. Those pictures are taken with a camera turned by 90° or rotated later by software, thus creating the illusion of people walking on walls or ceilings. While the original pictures depict the physical impossibility of a rotated gravitational force, Cueball uses the aforementioned technique to create pictures of himself on a climbing wall. Megan approaches him from above the wall, indicating that the climbing wall is in fact lying on the floor. It becomes clear that Cueball was not able to climb a real wall and therefore crawled on the floor with his camera adjusted accordingly.  Her comment is a sideswipe on the practise of self-display on Facebook, which is often done with the help of image manipulation.  The title text implies that Cueball has in fact stolen a real climbing wall, and that Megan wants him to return it.","[Cueball seen from his back, as he is ascending a gray climbing wall with 16 white handles in different shapes and sizes. He is standing on one near the bottom left of the panel with his left foot, holding on to a large handle to the left of his head, and one to the right at shoulder height. His right foot is seeking hold on another handle above knee hight of his left leg.]  [Cueball is seen in profile still climbing up the gray wall, which is drawn in the right part of the panel, 13 handles protruding. At the top of the panel something is protruding from the wall at more than ninety degree angle to the wall, as the line soon goes off panel at the top, but it seems to be directed at a small white half circle at the top of the panel. The line begins in front of the last of the handles at the top, a small one, and below this there is a larger handle bending up making it easy to hold on to. Cueball is holding on with his hands to two similar ""easy"" handles.]  [Cueball climbs a bit further up till his hand reaches the up bending handle in front of the line, and his lower leg and upper knee touches the two handles his hands where on before. Here he has stopped climbing and lifts his head back to look up and sees Megan standing there above him (as she was also doing at the top of the previous panel, but cut of at leg and face).

672: Suggestions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/672:_Suggestions,social_networking,An hour later: SUGGESTION: LICK HER NIPPLE MORE.,"Social networking site Facebook routinely suggests reconnecting with Facebook friends whom you haven't interacted with on the website for a while. This is taken to its logical extreme in this comic when that Facebook feature repeatedly, in an increasingly voyeuristic fashion, tries to get Cueball to hook up with his occasional friend-with-benefits Susie, despite the fact that Cueball knows she's falling for him and doesn't want to lead her on.  According to the title text, Cueball and Susie (who is drawn as a sexy version of Megan) do end up hooking up, even against Cueball's better judgement, as so often happens between people who're physically attracted to one another. And he apparently left the webcam on as well, because the Facebook feature is now giving suggestions on what Cueball should do to her, mid-coitus.","[Cueball is sitting at his computer. Facebook sidebar messages appear on the top of each panel, with a user photo of Susie (looking like Megan leaning forward so her hair hangs down the sides of her face) and a few lines of text.] Facebook: Susie Reconnect with her [Phone icon] Send her a text Cueball: Come on, Facebook. I know I shouldn't.  Facebook: Susie She'd come over [Bed icon] You don't have to fall asleep alone. Cueball: It's been so hard to stop. But she's falling for me, and I can't keep getting her hopes up like this.  Facebook: Susie Life is complicated [Icon of stick figures embracing] She's so warm against you. You both want it. Cueball: (pulling out phone) Maybe if I just make it clear it's not going to be a thing... Cueball: Yeah, we'll just have a talk.  Facebook: Susie Oh yeah. Mmm... [Webcam icon] Leave your webcam on so I can watch. Cueball: Okay, this feature is getting creepier and creepier."
723: Seismic Waves,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/723:_Seismic_Waves,social_networking,The USGS operates a really neat email/SMS earthquake notification service (earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/) that allows fine-grained control of notifications.,"One stereotype surrounding Twitter users is that they are more concerned with broadcasting their current status than they are with addressing it. Earthquakes are natural disasters caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, known for the destruction that they leave in their wake. The comic outlines the potential that technology can have in warning people about earthquakes, which is unfortunately negated by the tendency of the typical users of the technology to care more about sharing the warning message than they are to preserve their own lives.  The title text is a geology pun, as ""fine-grained"" is a common term used by geologists to describe rocks.  Real scientists are trying to turn this speed difference into a practical tool. Go figure.","When an earthquake hits, people flood the internet with posts about it-some within 20 or 30 seconds. [A room with a desk, chair, and computer are shaking. The person in it is on his phone, using Twitter.] RobM163 Huge earthquake here!  Damaging seismic waves travel at 3-5km/s. Fiber signals move at ~200,000km/s. (minus network lag)  This means when the seismic waves are about 100km out, they begin to be overtaken by the waves of posts ABOUT them. [There is a geographical border on a map; the front edge of the wave of the quake is shown, with the front edge of the wave of tweets surpassing it.]  People outside this radius may get word of the quake via Twitter, IRC, or SMS BEFORE the shaking hits. [Megan and Cueball are standing, holding cell phones. Megan is looking at hers.] Megan: Whoa! Earthquake!  Sadly, a Twitterer's first instinct is not to find shelter. Megan and Cueball (on phones): RT @RobM163 Huge earthquake here!"
743: Infrastructures,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/743:_Infrastructures,social_networking,"The heartfelt tune it plays is CC licensed, and you can get it from my seed on JoinDiaspora.net whenever that project gets going.","Cueball has sent an essay to a friend. While the essay itself was good, his friend was worried because the essay was in the .doc format, the proprietary format that old versions of Microsoft Word used. The friend advises Cueball to use a format based on an open standard,  possibly a format like ODF, ODT, ODS, ODP, or OpenOffice XML.   Cueball, who does not appreciate his friend's contradicting him, argued that the friend is making petty fights about the details of software instead of simply bothering that the software works (which is, in essence, a primordial purpose of software). Given that it can be a challenge to move from a familiar proprietary application to an open-source rival which may lack compatibility, features, support and popularity, Cueball has *some* justification for his stance.  The bearded fellow brings up that he is just concerned about the current proprietary software infrastructure that forces users to use software in a specific way, penalizing them for sharing the software or even preventing looking at the source code in order to learn what the program actually does or how it works. Cueball makes a retort that his friend has an arrogance that crowds out his perspective while claiming that he is autistic. However, it is highly unlikely that Cueball truly believes his friend is autistic. Instead, it's much more likely that he's comparing his friend's behavior to that of people with autism(such as his intense fixation on things that seem trivially important to others), similar to the banter used on online forums and imageboards such as 4chan's /g/ board.   Seven years later, Cueball runs to the friend, alarmed about Facebook's heavy policies about its complete control about the information its users submit. Since Facebook is like Microsoft in its lack of transparency about their services and taking away a lot of control from the user, the fellow retorts with playing ""the world's tiniest open-source violin.""   This is dubious since ""playing the world's smallest violin"" is a sarcastic expression that denotes that the speaker will not give pity to the recipient.  In response to this comic, a 3D model for a tiny violin was released as open source files.  The title text references the following pieces of infrastructure that are compatible with the ""free software"" ideology:  The problem with the lack of open source and Facebook is also the subject of 1390: Research Ethics.","2003: [Cueball approaches a bearded fellow.] Cueball: Did you get my essay? Bearded Fellow: Yeah, it was good! But it was a .doc; You should really use a more open- Cueball: Give it a rest already. Maybe we just want to live our lives and use software that works, not get wrapped up in your stupid nerd turf wars.  Bearded Fellow: I just want people to care about the infrastructures we're building and who- Cueball: No, you just want to feel smugly superior. You have no sense of perspective and are probably autistic.  2010: Cueball: Oh my God! We handed control of our social world to Facebook and they're DOING EVIL STUFF!  Bearded Fellow: Do you see this?  [Inset, the bearded fellow rubs his index and middle fingers against his thumb.] Bearded Fellow: It's the world's tiniest open-source violin."
792: Password Reuse,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/792:_Password_Reuse,social_networking,It'll be hilarious the first few times this happens.,"This comic has three layers: hacking, philosophy, and Google-satire.  It starts off on a practical level, with Black Hat describing to Cueball a devious social engineering scheme. It relies on the fact that people commonly reuse the same password on multiple websites, and tend to create accounts on new websites somewhat indiscriminately. Thus, one could create a simple Web service to collect users' usernames, email addresses, and passwords. Since many users will reuse this combination on other websites as well, the website owner can try to hack their accounts on other common sites, such as Amazon, PayPal or even people's banks, using the same login information.  In panel 7, the comic suddenly develops a philosophical and ethical bent. Black Hat reveals that he has already carried out step 1, through his numerous unprofitable Web services which he had been running for this very purpose. However, after successfully executing the hack, he realizes that he does not know what to do with all this power.  He reveals that he is already financially self-sufficient, and makes a point that money can't buy happiness once past that point, he even states that research has proven this. He could use his power to realize his sadistic pleasures of messing with people, but he's already a serial classhole and does not need this information to continue that trend.   If he had any beliefs or ideology, he could use this power to try to spread them. However, he reveals that ""since March of 1997"" he doesn't really believe in anything. This could possibly refer to the March 26, 1997 incident in San Diego, California, where 39 Heaven's Gate cultists committed mass suicide at their compound. It is a plausible explanation, since one of them was the brother of Nichelle Nichols (a Star Trek actress), so the event got a big resonance in nerd circles (and Randall often refers to Star Trek in xkcd). It's also possible that Black Hat was a sincere member of the cult, but the religion disbanded after the suicides, or that he orchestrated the cult. However, given Black Hat's strange behavior, it could be anything, even Bill Clinton banning federal funding for human cloning research. Maybe he will finally find a belief he wish to spread after his revelation in 1717: Pyramid Honey. This lack of a belief could also be a reference to the Phoenix Lights. While this event caused since to believe in extraterrestrials, it is possible that Black Hat's contrary nature is so ingrained into his personality that the event caused him to stop having beliefs or opinions of any kind.  The dilemma: Black Hat has cleverly executed a hack that has given him a lot of power, but he doesn't know what to do with it.   The last part of the comic now transitions to a satire on how Google has already gone through both the stages described above. It describes how all of Google's free services are simply a ploy to collect and control all the world's information, similar in concept but grander than the hack described in part 1. It satirizes the notion that behind Google's ""Don't be evil"" motto is actually an end-goal of using their powers eventually for evil.   However, just like Black Hat, once Google reaches the stage where they are able to capitalize on their powers, the Cueball-like head-executive finds that there is nothing evil left for them to desire, except (as Hairbun states) make even more money. As they already make a lot of money this ploy is moot, and anything remaining that they wish to do, such as hosting Call of Duty (CoD) tournaments, isn't evil at all.   In the end the secretary calls dibs on the TV in the lobby in order to play CoD4 on what (one can assume) is a large screen. The Cueball-like executive who wished to implement the evil plan in the first place facepalms when he realizes that Google just sucks at being evil.  In the title text, “The first few times this happens” may refer to the weekly CoD4 “tournament.” Alternatively, it could also mean the “first few times” a company decides to turn evil (but then has no idea how).  This comic was directly referenced in the title text of 1286: Encryptic.","[Black Hat is standing to the left behind Cueball, who is sitting in an office chair at his desk working on his computer. A message from the computer is indicated with a zigzag line from the screen.] Black Hat: Password entropy is rarely relevant. The real modern danger is password reuse. Cueball: How so? Computer: Password too weak  [Zoom in on Black Hat's upper part as he holds a hand up with the palm up.] Black Hat: Set up a Web service to do something simple, like image hosting or tweet syndication, so a few million people set up free accounts.

Black Hat: Why do you think I hosted so many unprofitable web services?  [Zoom in on Black Hat's head now turned towards left.] Black Hat: I could probably net in a lot of money, one way or another, if I did things carefully. But research shows more money doesn't make people happier, once they make enough to avoid day-to-day financial stress.  [Zooming a bit out, but still only showing Black Hat's head in the bottom right corner, again facing right.] Black Hat: I could mess with people endlessly, but I do that already. I could get a political or religious idea out to most of the world, but since March of 1997 I don't really believe in anything.

855: 1999,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/855:_1999,social_networking,"Whoa, twenty-two in two hours!' 'Your site got twenty-two hundred hits in two hours?' 'No. Twenty-two. But still, that's like half the people on the internet!'","This comic is a parody of the movie The Social Network, a movie about the founding of the popular social network site Facebook. Here, scenes from the movie are reimagined to feature Zombo.com instead. Zombo.com, also known as Zombocom, is a website that was created in 1999 and using only Flash animations. Randall, like many others more, doesn't like this technique at all. The animation consists of a circle of quickly pulsating dots and a friendly deep male voice repeatedly welcoming the visitor to ""Zombocom"" and explaining that there was no limit to what could be done at the site, or rather, no limit except yourself. The message repeats while, ironically, there is absolutely nothing that can be done at the site until the message completes, at which point a link saying ""Sign up for our newZletter"" appears, linking to a page saying that the selected option is not available yet. If the link is not clicked, the Flash player will reset. Thus, you can still do nothing on the site.  The humor of the parody comes in substituting Facebook, a useful and popular website, for Zombo.com, a novelty site which gained attention for its complete uselessness.  Turn on your speakers and check zombo.com for yourself.  The last four panels are all direct parodies of specific scenes from The Social Network. The second panel is a takeoff of the scene where Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg comes up with the idea for the site, saying that people like checking up on their friends and acquaintances, so why not build a site that lets them do that? Because Zombo.com has no actual function, in this version the founder can't specify what he wants the site to do.  The third panel is taken from a scene where Zuckerberg is seen intensely focused on his work programming the site, his headphones insulating him from the outside world. His assistant describes his state as ""wired in"" and demands that he not be disturbed. In the comic, as Zombo.com is a very simple site which does not need much coding, the assistant offers the possibility that the founder is stoned as a reason for his focus. Indeed, it's one of the few conceivable reasons that one would be this focused on such a boring and pointless website.  The fourth panel is taken from a scene where co-founder Eduardo Saverin tries to push for monetization of Facebook, while investor and consultant Sean Parker argues against. The actual dialogue is ""You don't even know what the thing is yet. How big it can get, how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool? A billion dollars."" Here, instead of a billion dollars, the Parker character argues ""Circles,"" playing off Zombo.com's un-lucrative nature and the silliness of the design.   The final panel is taken from a scene where Parker advises Zuckerberg to change the name of the site from TheFacebook to just Facebook, calling it ""cleaner."" Here, he advises to change the name of Zombo.com to just Zombocom. Why the website is pronounced ""Zombocom"" rather than the more expected Zombo Dot Com is a mystery known only to its creators; perhaps, like in the movie, they also considered it cleaner.  The title text is a reference to a quote from the movie, specifically a conversation between Zuckerberg and Delpy (Zuckerberg is the first quote). In the actual film, Zuckerberg answers ""twenty-two thousand"" rather than just ""twenty-two"". This is a joke to the effect that, back in 1999, there weren't really that many people on the internet, and very few of them would have gone to Zombo.com","It's easy to forget, as we heap awards on The Social Network, That before there was Facebook, MySpace, or even Friendster... One website dreamed bigger than them all.  [Cueball and another are talking.] Cueball: People like doing stuff. So why not build a website that offers that? Another: Offers what? What would I do there? Cueball: Anything! The only limit is yourself!  [Another scene. Hacker, wearing headphones and oblivious, working at computer. Cueball runs in to interrupt; Another holds him back.] Cueball: Hey, we need more— Another: Don't–he's wired in. Hacker: The infinite is possible. Another: Or baked. It's hard to tell.  [Cueball and another at table in bar.] Cueball: It's time to monetize. We could make millions! Another: No way. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? Cueball: A billio– Another: Circles.  [Long shot in bar. Drinks on table in foreground; dim figures in doorway in background; Cueball, alone, shouting into the distance.] Cueball: Hey–a tip: drop the dot. Cueball: Just ""Zombocom"".

918: Google+,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/918:_Google%2B,social_networking,"On one hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch. On the other hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch!","At the time of the comic's release, Google+ was a new social network announced by Google on June 28, 2011. When it launched there were many tech articles written about G+, which appears to look and/or function similarly to Facebook. In the first panel, Megan describes G+ as 'not Facebook'. Facebook is a popular social networking site. She then describes G+ as being like Facebook.  After Cueball thinks about it in the second frame, he comes to a realization in the third frame that a social network like Facebook, but not related to Facebook is all he really wanted. This is in reference to the backlash that happens every so often wherein people grow tired of Facebook, its arcane policies, its cavalier attitude toward user privacy and/or its general disdain for end users, and people want to leave Facebook, but have no comparable platform to move their social networking to.  The title text uses ""you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch"" as both point and counterpoint in an argument, since this fact has both negative (your parents won't see posts you want them to see, and won't be able to post things for you to see) and positive (your parents won't see posts you don't want them to see, and you won't have to worry about keeping up with their posts) implications.","Megan: You should join Google+! Cueball: What is it? Megan: Not Facebook! Cueball: What's it like? Megan: Facebook!  [Cueball considers.]  Cueball: Oh, what the hell. Cueball: I guess that's all I really wanted. click"
929: Speculation,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/929:_Speculation,social_networking,"I was pretty good at skeet shooting, but was eventually kicked off the range for catching the clay pigeons in a net and dispatching them execution-style.'","During a basketball game, the players discuss the nature of universal conformity. Facebook and Google+ are competing social networks, at the time of this comic many people were switching to Plus over Facebook leading many to speculate that Facebook was in decline and that Plus would soon be the dominant social network. (Incidentally, as of 2017, it seems that Facebook has successfully held its position as the Default Social Network™, while Plus has largely become known as ""that thing YouTube tried to make us all sign up for once"".)  The two players seem to have a disagreement over this. One player states that it would be ridiculous to expect everyone to move to Plus. The other player denies the notion that they have to, valuing his personal preference over conformity. He supports this by saying that his mother still uses AOL and other people continue using IRC, if each time a new dominant social network emerged and everyone switched to it neither of these things would stick around.  They are interrupted when they pass the ball to Black Hat who immediately shoots it with a crossbow bolt. Their arguments and rather intelligent discussion are derailed by the absurdity of Black Hat's reaction which is both humorous and puts the issue in stark contrast.  Black Hat neither joins in the discussion nor does he participate in the game and it seems that any offer to participate in either is met with a blunt and clear denial. He is simply not a conformist.  In the title text Black Hat continues to provide an example of his tendency to play by his own rules. A clay pigeon is a clay disc that is thrown into the air and serves as a target on a skeet shooting range. Participants are expected to shoot the pigeons with a shotgun but Black Hat would rather capture the clay pigeons and shoot them from a very close range. This is made even more humorous by the excellent crossbow skills he shows in the comic. This practice eventually got him expelled from the shooting range.","[Two Cueball-like guys are playing basketball. The right guy (Cueball) attempts to throw the basketball through the hoop, but it bounces off down to his friend. To the right Black Hat has his back to the other two while he is looking at his phone.] Friend: Do you seriously think everyone will move to Plus? It was hard enough getting them on Facebook.  [The friend has caught the rebound and now passes the basketball back to Cueball. Black Hat is not shown.] Cueball: Do they have to?

I mean, IRC is still—  [Zoom in on the basketball as an arrow pierces the ball.] Thunk  [Cueball looks to Black Hat who has a crossbow in one hand, he is still looking at the phone in his other hand.

935: Missed Connections,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/935:_Missed_Connections,social_networking,The Street View van isn't going to find out anything Google won't already know from reading my email.,"Missed Connections is a page on Craigslist in which people who saw each other briefly and want to reconnect attempt to find each other again. In the case of missed connections, one person describes themselves ""Me"" and describes the other person ""You"" in order that the second person would recognize themself and try to reconnect.  The first entry appears to be a goofy joke, although there have been many Wienermobile incidents in the past. Given the timing of this comic, one can't help but wonder if it might also be a pun referencing the then recent resignation of Rep. Anthony Weiner over tweeting pictures of his, well, wiener with his mobile device.  The second entry refers to a person (you) looking down into a wishing well (presumably to throw in a coin to get a wish), but someone (me) is sitting down in the well with a harpoon looking up spotting the silhouette at the top of the well. This seems like a very weird thing to do, and the vaguely human shadow may be lucky to be alive, since the only reason the ""you"" should know about the ""me"" is if the me fired the harpoon (and missed). A person sitting in a well telling people stuff (as if it was the well speaking) was the pun in 568: Well 2. Oddly enough, this entry could possibly be a reference to this episode of The Fairly OddParents.  The third entry is a reference to networking. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. UDP packets don't use handshaking to verify they have contacted the correct host, so they can get lost or confused. The Cisco router location is a block of IP addresses that was unallocated at the time when this comic was published but has been allocated to Latin America and Caribbean since then. Cisco is a company that makes networking equipment. This is a play on a missed connection for someone who was lost and asked for directions.  The fourth entry is a reference to two events in 2011 in which President Barack Obama invited rappers--among other people--to the White House. After each event, right-wing commentators blasted the event as a party unbecoming of the dignity of the White House. Nancy Pelosi is the Democratic Leader of the US House of Representatives. The acronym (D-CA) is a common notation for politicians which notates party (D for Democrat) and state (CA for California). Pelosi would have also been invited to these events, and the missed connections listing is a reference to what the commentators imagined the event would have been like. A ""juggalo"" is a term referring to a fan of the rap group Insane Clown Posse (which includes rapper Violent J), which is notorious for having wild, misogynistic and violent fanbase.  The fifth entry is a straightforward joke. One of the two people getting married was so distracted by their phone they have no clue where their spouse is now, or even who they are. Alternatively, it could be that the second party deserted the wedding because they were frustrated by their partner being distracted by their cell phone during the wedding, and the first partner is now hoping to convince them to return.  The sixth entry is a reference to how the Google Street View car was not only recording photos of the street in 360 degrees, it was also collecting data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. The comic takes this to the next level, that the Google Street View van also scans what we have in our pockets and does a retinal scan. In this case, the social security number referenced is the most used SSN of all time. The retinal scan takes this even further, indicating that Google's cameras are collecting fine enough images to identify people by Retinal scan.  The entry gets a bit absurd when you realize with all this data, it should be trivial for the Google employee to ID and meet this young man, and would not need the Missed Connections page.  The last entry suggests that Babe Ruth, the American baseball slugger of 1914-1935, is actually a Time Lord. Time Lord is a reference to the popular sci-fi series Doctor Who in which The Doctor, who is a Time Lord, uses a TARDIS, which is a time travel machine. Possibly because he was a baseball player ""ahead of his time"".  The title text is another reference to the privacy concerns surrounding Google Street View van, to which Google responded by claiming that the street view camera wouldn't capture anything that someone walking by wouldn't be able to see. Randall is not worried about the street view van since he expects that Google will already know anything that such a van could discover from reading his e-mails. This last statement is of course much more serious that having a photo taken by a passing van, thus making it clear what people should fuss about, and it is not the van.","[The page is set up like the missed connections area of Craigslist, with a list of messages from an individual to a person they weren't able to communicate with at the time.

The phrase that Cueball used to use when he heard a random phrase was ""would be a good name for a band.""

There could be several reasons for this, but he mentions that it would be hard to direct fans to the band's website. As an example, someone who hears ""www.thedottumblrdotcom.com"" might instead write it out as ""www.the.tumblr.com.com"" since '.' is often pronounced as ""dot."" If the band's website was hosted on Tumblr, then their website would be ""dottumblrdotcom.tumblr.com"".  Raccoons are also feature in a disgusting situations in 1565: Back Seat.","[Megan and Cueball are talking.] Megan:  You know those weird noises from my attic?  Turns out some raccoons got in and were operating this, like, raccoon sex dungeon.  Cueball: ...dot tumblr dot com.  [Caption below the panel:] For me, ""...Dot tumblr dot com"" has been gradually replacing ""...would be a good name for a band."""
1034: Share Buttons,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1034:_Share_Buttons,social_networking,The only post to achieve perfect balance between the four was a hilarious joke about Mark Zuckerberg getting caught using a pseudonym to sneak past the TSA.,"This comic is a commentary on what sort of articles work best on different social networking services. From left to right the share buttons are: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google+.  The title text humorously combines appealing subjects for all four networks:","[A series of article titles with four share buttons underneath each: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google+]  Breaking Into Stand-up Comedy FB: 3, Twitter: 1,781, Reddit: 2, G+: 0  How the Christian Right Threatens Wikipedia FB: 1, Twitter: 0, Reddit: 2,241, G+: 3  Boycott Facebook Today!

1045: Constraints,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1045:_Constraints,social_networking,[title-text similarly alphabetized],"An epigram is a brief, interesting, usually memorable and sometimes surprising or satirical statement. Constrained writing is an age-old literary phenomenon, where writers impose rules or patterns in their works. Haiku is a well known example of this.  Twitter is a short message social network and communication service. All messages (known as tweets) on the service need to be under 140 characters. Until August 2015 even private messages had that restriction. Twitter is frequently used by well-known comedians as a place to make interesting jokes and observations.  All the words spoken by Megan, from ""Yeah"" to ""alphabetization"", are in reverse alphabetical order. Here are the starting letters (with extra letter when more than one word in a row begins with the same letter):   It both answers Cueball's question and exemplifies with an ingenious self-reference, while being short enough (133 characters) to be a valid tweet — hence the ""whoa.""  The title text, ""title-text similarly alphabetized"", is also backwards-alphabetized and self-referential. Starting letters:","[Cueball sits in an office chair at his computer desk, motioning toward the screen with a hand as Megan stands behind him.] Cueball: I don't get why authors and comedians spend so much energy trying to be clever on Twitter. Couldn't they put that creativity into more books and scripts?  Cueball: Is there something they like about the 140-character format?  [Same picture but in a frame-less panel, except Cueball has taken his arm down.] Megan: Yeah. Writers working under tight restrictions produce novel material—like, for example, epigrams employing backward alphabetization.  [A slim panel with only Cueball at his computer desk shown.] Cueball: ...Whoa."
1057: Klout,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1057:_Klout,social_networking,"Though please do confirm that it's actually *me* on Klout first, and not one of my friends trying to get me punched. The great thing about this douchebag deadman switch is that I will never dare trigger it.","Klout is a site that seeks to measure your ""influence"" on social media networks. They sometimes give away ""perks"" to the users with the highest Klout scores, as a means of advertising the products of their sponsors. Generally, the information provided by Klout is not held in high esteem. The type of person who takes most interest in their score is typically not well-liked.  There are multiple ways that Klout measures your influence. An example of increasing influence is having been given a +K (a recommendation for a higher score) for knowledge about ""Pitbull"" (The Bud Light promoter and producer/rapper/musician, etc., not the type of dog). Another could be having an inspiring tweet that generated 2000 retweets. Klout supports many social networks, and ranks people based primarily on how much reaction they garner from the public. For example, if Selena Gomez tweeted that she simply loved a certain blog, she would probably get more people to visit that blog, and thus get a bigger Klout score, than if the mayor of Anchorage, Alaska tweeted that he liked that blog. Or xkcd publishing a comic about Klout would lead to an all time high in Google searches for it. However, their ""about us"" page does claim that a small, active group of followers is considered more influential than a large, passive group of followers.  The gist of the comic is that Cueball (here representing Randall) does not feel that Klout agrees with his core values, probably as he prefers self-assurance to having an outside authority tell him of his importance to society. He uses this comic to give himself incentive to stay away from Klout. He is very clear that he is dead serious about anyone meeting him after he has (been proven to have) used Klout should punch him in the face. He even makes sure that he cannot later retract this statement, if he for instance becomes interested in Klout (something he never wish for). Because his last statement is that people should ignore anything he says to retract this statement later.  Randall will now have a problem though because since he also posted the 706: Freedom comic earlier, he will never knows if people that hit him does because they believe he has used Klout or just to exercise their free will.   In the title text a ""dead man's switch"" is any mechanism which is designed to activate if the user does not take any action. This is generally used to create a failsafe in case the user is incapacitated  For example, many exercise treadmills include a tether meant to connect the runner to the machine's base station. If the runner gets too far from the base station, the tether pulls a pin and the machine stops immediately. This way, if the runner has fallen or is struggling to keep up, the machine does not exacerbate an already unsafe situation. Randall's ""douchebag deadman switch"" is a variation that would trigger if he ever became enough of an asshole to use Klout. This would lead to him being constantly punched in the face, so he doesn't dare become that type of person.  Shortly after this comic was posted, a Klout user was created claiming to be Randall. This was a fake, so if you ever meet Randall in real life, please don't punch him.","[Randall has drawn himself as Cueball in a slim panel:] Randall: I'd like to ask a favor.  Randall: If someday, in the future, we meet in person,  [Zoom out of Randall talking.] Randall: And if, as of that day, I've interacted with Klout in any way except to opt out,  Randall: I want you to punch me in the face without warning.  [Zoom in on Randall's head.] Randall: This may sound like a joke, so let me be clear:  Randall: I am dead serious.  Randall: Ignore anything I say retracting this.  Randall: Thank you."
1085: ContextBot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1085:_ContextBot,social_networking,"If you read all vaguebooking/vaguetweeting with the assumption that they're saying everything they can without revealing classified military information, the internet gets way more exciting.","This comic is a commentary on the practice of ""vaguebooking"" or ""vaguetweeting"", which is posting a short message of sadness or frustration without context.    Google has been criticized more than a few times for keeping rather extensive data records on its users, who by this point constitute most of the internet, enough to cause serious damage if Google wasn't historically altruistic (as altruistic as a for-profit company can be). In the comic, ContextBot is a fictitious Google invention which puts context for these statuses, presumably based on all that personal data which Google has collected:  As noted by the subtitle, ContextBot is considered a great good by everyone who was sick of vaguebooking. This also redeems Google's practice of all those data records in the public's eye.  In the ContextBot's avatar image, three people can be seen together hanging out. But the image is about to be cropped, leaving out the third person and therefore giving the impression that the two people in the cropped image are there without that person. This demonstrates how context is important to understanding a situation.  The title text refers to the cryptic ways in which someone with sensitive information must communicate. While most vaguebooking/vaguetweeting is about things of little importance, the title text implies that the things not mentioned impact national/global security. This implies that many tweets may actually be related to high-clearance military and or national security information, but must be vague in order to keep it secret, and if you take that as the context, then the internet suddenly becomes much more exciting.","[A social network feed with four status updates from four different people. Each one has a reply from the same account, which is called 'ContextBot', underneath.] Close-up face with glasses: The things I put up with... ContextBot: (His building's WiFi doesn't reach the bathroom.) Male female couple: You'd think by now I'd have learned never to trust anyone. ContextBot: (She downloaded a torrent that turned out to be an encrypted .rar and a link to a survey.) Blonde girl with bangs: I officially give up. ContextBot: (She hit alt-tab to hide Minecraft at work and accidentally dropped a stack of diamond into lava.) Spiky hair guy: Sighhhh ContextBot: (He thought these grapes were seedless.) Everyone stopped complaining about Google's data-gathering when they launched ContextBot, a system which replies to vague, enigmatic social network posts with context from the poster's life."
1143: Location,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1143:_Location,social_networking,Ingress: Foursquare With Space Noises.,"Ingress is an augmented reality location-based service game in which players have to visit certain real-world places marked by the game as containing in-game objectives called portals (much like in its well known offspring Pokemon GO). The single guy in the comic owns a home surrounded by an abundance of portals, which makes it an attractive destination for the three friends who contact him via the computer. They are obviously not really friends of the guy, but just wish to come by because of the portals.  The portals in the comic are controlled by the green ""Enlightened"" team (and have links and a field), making them valuable resource caches for the ""Enlightened"" team, and priority targets for the blue ""Resistance"" team.  Foursquare, referenced in the title text, is another service that lets users check into places they visit for discounts in a similar way to how Ingress players visit portals for points. Unlike Foursquare places, which are businesses and public places such as parks, Ingress portals also include historic houses that are still private residences, as well as churches, so Ingress is more likely to reward people visiting a friend's house. ""Space noises"" refers to the ambient sounds when playing Ingress.","[Three people around a computer. One of them is typing.] Typing: Hey, party tonight?

1150: Instagram,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1150:_Instagram,social_networking,"I'm gonna call the cops and get Chad arrested for theft, then move all my stuff to the house across the street. Hopefully the owners there are more responsible.","As indicated by the title, this comic is an allegory for a controversy over Instagram, a photo-sharing social network now owned by Facebook. In December 2012, Instagram changed their terms of use, allowing the network to sell user-uploaded images, without profit to the content generators. This infuriated many users, who closed their accounts or stopped uploading images.  In the comic Cueball tells his Cueball-like friend about his problem with Chad, who just send him a note telling him that he no longer wants to store all this stuff that Cueball has left in his garage. Cueball left it there because Chad has nice shelves and lets him in to see his stuff whenever he wishes, so that was really convenient.  Chad's note tells Cueball that he has a month to move his shit - after that he will try to get rid of it by selling it on Craigslist. This is a website where individuals can contact others interested in buying or selling goods. As a verb, it means to sell something on Craigslist. (FYI is an abbreviation of  For Your Information).   Cueball is outraged, as this is not way to run a storage business. But when his friend asks him if he paid anything for this ""storage business"" it turns out that he did not. The friend then concludes that it is not a storage business.   This is exactly the problem with Instagram (or its users). A user does not pay anything, but to create an account you have to sign a terms of service/end user license agreement. A user has thus effectively signed their consent to whatever Instagram has written. Instagram can then change these terms if they give a forewarning (as Chad has done here). Unfortunately, most users don't read the terms before clicking the ""I agree"" option, so it can come as a shock when Instagram uses the data in a way the user hadn't anticipated.   Instead of getting angry Cueball should thus just go and remove his stuff, but instead he is just going to almost (but not quite) stop giving Chad any more stuff.   This is also making fun of those Instagram users that complain about the new way of using their data, but at the same time keep uploading more pictures. The users have often developed a kind of addiction, so they cannot just stop sharing their life (in pictures).  In the title text Cueball continues with an idea of calling the cops. He thinks that Chad is a thief. He thus ignores that he left the stuff at Chad's house of his own accord. And after Chad has been arrested (which will of course never happen) he wishes to move all his stuff to another house, just to continue to get free storage.   There are two major flaws in this logic - and it is the same with the logic of the disgruntled Instagram users. You cannot accuse Instagram of stealing because it was you who gave them the images in the first place, and it is irresponsible to assume that this will not happen if you give your photos to another social networking company (like Facebook).  These kind of issues (with Facebook as the evildoer) are also the subject of 743: Infrastructures and 1390: Research Ethics.","[Cueball, raising a hand, is talking to his Cueball-like friend who is sitting by his computer.] Cueball: I've been putting all my stuff in Chad's garage. Cueball: He has nice shelves. Cueball: And he lets me in to see it whenever I want.  [In the next panel, without a frame, there is a close up of a note. Above the note is a small black frame with Cueballs comment:] Cueball (off-panel): But I got this note from him: [The note:] Dude In like a month im gonna Craigslist all that shit you left in my garage Just FYI -Chad   [Zoom in on Cueball who lifts both hands palms up.] Cueball: It's an outrage! This is no way to run a storage business! Friend (off-panel): Are you paying him to look after your stuff?  [Final frame almost like the first frame, but Cueball has taken his hands down.] Cueball: No. Friend: Then what he runs isn't a storage business. Cueball: Well, I'm this close to not giving him any more stuff. Friend: That'll teach him."
1239: Social Media,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1239:_Social_Media,social_networking,The social media reaction to this asteroid announcement has been sharply negative. Care to respond?,"This comic parodies how journalists tend to focus on social networking. Specifically in the case of revolutions, social media is given a lot of weight, even in countries with limited internet access. A direct parallel is made to the so-called Twitter Revolutions.  On Twitter you can send text messages with a maximum of 140 characters. This means that there could not be much content in a single post, but often many people follow the people doing these tweets. People who are not on social media tend to react like Cueball and come to the conclusion that twitter makes press coverage more stupid, just because those messages lack much detail. Cueball is also surprised about the stupidity of trying to link social media to the orbit of the asteroid — social media obviously has no impact on the orbit of any space objects, which are entirely driven by physics and gravitational mechanics, and are not influenced by opinions on any media.  The title text continues the joke. The negativity on Twitter concerning an earth bound asteroid has nothing to do with the press conference that announced it but rather with the negativity of wiping out life on earth in general. Again, journalists give undue weight to social media.  It's simply that ""How has twitter affected this"" has become a standard question for journalists, posed in complete disregard of the actual event.","[Cueball heads a press conference.] Cueball: NASA has confirmed that the asteroid is heading directly for us. Cueball: ...Yes, a question? Reporter 1: What role has social media played in this asteroid's orbit? Cueball: *sigh* Reporter 2: Has twitter changed the way we respond to asteroid threats? Cueball: Well, it's made the press conference questions stupider. Reporter 3: Fascinating! Reporter 4: What about Facebook?"
1250: Old Accounts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1250:_Old_Accounts,social_networking,"If you close an account while it's still friends with people, it contributes to database linkage accumulation slowdown, which is a major looming problem for web infrastructure and definitely not a thing I just made up.","Cueball is very dramatically following the described process of removing himself from a social network by first unfriending each contact. Such actions are not necessary on any well-designed website. Actively unfriending people individually could be perceived as rude, antisocial, or in need of help.  Even though one may not have visited a social network for years, they are still sitting there, gathering one's ""friends""' statuses, opinions and comments.   The reverse order to unfriend people refers to correct memory allocation and deallocation processes for computers. If one does not follow this process and deallocates an older memory block before a newer one, all information about the newer block could be lost. This would prevent the user from being able to deallocate it. If the process repeats over and over, memory usage will accumulate and will eventually result in an out of memory error.   This is not needed on databases, but databases used on websites, such as social networking sites, could run into a similar issue. If accounts are deactivated the users that were friends to the deactivated account may maintain the link to the deactivated account. This could (if the database was not well designed) create a non trivial amount of garbage data.  In the title text, ""database linkage accumulation slowdown"" really is a thing that Randall just made up. This may be a satire of popular fears of made-up technological problems, often held by those who are not technologically savvy.","[Caption above the frame:] The internet is filled with derelict accounts aggregating news about friends long forgotten.  [Cueball sits at a desk, typing on a laptop and the responding text follows as:] *Click* Uhh, is everything OK? *Click* Dude, what the hell? *Click*  [Caption below the frame:] When you find yourself drifting away from a community, remember to clean up after yourself by slowly unfriending everyone, one by one, in the reverse order that you added them."
1305: Undocumented Feature,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1305:_Undocumented_Feature,social_networking,"And it doesn't pop up a box every time asking you to use your real name. In fact, there's no way to set your name at all. You just have to keep reminding people who you are.","An undocumented feature is a part of a software product that is not explained in the documentation for the product. Cueball has found such a feature, a chat room intended to ask for help, accessible through the help page of some unnamed old Windows utility. The people who found the chat room started out using it for its intended purpose (helping users of the utility by contacting other users), however as time has passed they have become friends and enter the chat only to talk to each other, with no relation to computer problems.  A virtual machine (or VM) is a computer program designed to emulate the hardware of a full computer. In this case, users of the old chat room create VMs only to have the old operating system installed which included the utility program. They use this setup only to access the old chat room. This is shown in the third panel where Cueball is using a modern laptop to enter the chatroom (presumably by means of a VM), whereas Ponytail is most likely using an old computer (as evidenced by the CRT monitor).  A chat room like this must be hosted on some outside server, so the narrator of the comic wonders who runs this server. An obvious thought about this is if and when the server will be shut down, effectively cutting all communication among chat users. Another obvious thought is why the utility author is still maintaining the chat server, since its original purpose of allowing communication between users with problems with the utility program is no longer an issue as everybody has migrated to more modern systems. The comic suggests that the reason for doing this can be a bored sysadmin, who is just reading the messages of the chat users and following their lives but never writing anything. This would turn the chat room into a soap opera for the sysadmin.  The Deep Web is a term used to refer to any information which is available online, but is hard to find (usually because there are no links to that information in web pages). The chat room described would be an example of this. From this point on, the comic takes an existentialist turn (a frequent xkcd trait), talking about how life is short, everything has to end, etc.  The last panel is a reference to Facebook's recent announcement that it would start autoplaying video ads, and the title text refers to YouTube requiring its users to use their real-life identities instead of just nicknames. These last parts of the comics somehow reveal that the point of the whole comic is just to complain about aggressive money-driven policies used by modern social networks in general and Facebook in particular. It is hinted that Randall would prefer older technologies, where limited resources would forbid autoplaying videos or huge databases with every detail of every user's life.  It's possible that the comic is about an actual chat room, but more likely it is a complete invention, since if it were real someone would have been able to trace its origin. However, if it is real, the participants would not want to confirm this in order to protect their privacy.  The title text mentions the simplicity of this chat; even user names do not exist and other users could only be identified by their behavior because the user names are random and can change on every login.  There are many examples of undocumented features in programs written for old versions of Windows, for example:","[A support window is shown.] An old Windows utility has an undocumented feature. If you open ""help"" and click on the background, you get dropped into a ""support"" chat room. Support Window: Launching support forum...  [An active conversation between two people is shown.] Only a few of us ever found it. But we became friends.  [Cueball and Ponytail are at computers.] We kept launching the program to check in. Eventually some of us were running VMs just to keep accessing it.  [Another conversation.] As the Internet aged, so did we.  [Three question marks.] We don't know who runs the server. We don't know why it's still working so many years later. Maybe we're some sysadmin's soap opera.  [A group of people are shown in a bubble.] It will probably vanish someday, but for now it's our meeting place. Our hideaway.  [The bubble is now smaller, and some parts of a web are shown.] A life's worth of chat,  [More of the web is shown.] Buried in the deep web.  [A flat landscape is shown with the sun at the horizon.] But even if it lasts forever, we won't. When we're gone, who will remember us?  [Cueball and Hairy are shown standing together in a bubble.] Who will remember this strange little world and the friendships we built here?  Nobody.  [An empty bubble is shown.] This place is irrelevant. Ephemeral. One day it will be forgotten.  [The bubble starts to fade away.] And so will we  [The bubble has almost completely faded away.]  [The bubble is now completely gone.]  But at least it doesn't have fucking video ads."
1306: Sigil Cycle,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1306:_Sigil_Cycle,social_networking,"The cycle seems to be 'we need these symbols to clarify what types of things we're referring to!' followed by 'wait, it turns out words already do that.'","In computer programming, a variable is a way of storing information temporarily, for use later in the program. There are different types of variables, called data types, such as integers, strings, characters, and booleans, all of them holding different types of information. Integers hold whole numbers, strings hold text, and so on. Variables traditionally have names that identify their purpose, and a programmer should usually be able to infer from this variable name what type of variable it is. For example, if you want to store the name of the customer in a catalogue service, you might store the text in a string variable called ""NameOfCustomer"". Because it is fairly clear that names are made up of text, it is logical that this variable would be a string variable - if you didn't have any other information about it.  A sigil in computer programming is a symbol that appears before the variable name. It is an alternative method of telling someone who is reading the program code what data type the variable is. Rather than relying on logic, then, to know that NameOfCustomer is a string, you might use a sigil ""$"" before the variable name, as in $NameOfCustomer, which would specify that the variable can hold text. Sigils can also specify the scope of a variable, which refers to where the variable can be used in a program, and which parts of the program can access that variable. Sigils are useful in some ways because you don't have to refer to previous program code or find where the variable is declared (created) to know what data type it is. They also provide some level typing in languages that do not explicitly declare the type of the variable.  Most programming languages have a different method for storing variables, although some languages may use the same variable types under different names. The following are the programming languages referenced in the comic and how they use variables.  As is noted by the comic, the use of sigils to indicate types of variables varies between programming languages, from strict enforcement in languages like Perl, to their complete absence in languages like C++ (but see Hungarian Notation). The comic notes that the use of sigils seems to be cyclic, especially if you count things like hashtags as extensions of the pattern.  The title text describes the two competing influences responsible for the cycle: The first impulse finds sigils useful to elucidate the type of the variable, especially when variable names are not very descriptive, while the latter impulse notes that descriptive variable names are much more useful for that purpose, especially in extensible languages where the built-in types form only a small part of the type system.","A sinusoidal curve is shown. Y axis: Odds that the words I type will start with some weird symbol X axis: Time Data labels: [at first peak] $QBASIC, [at first trough] C++, [at second peak] $BASH, @$PERL, [at second trough] PYTHON, [at third peak] +GOOGLE, @TWITTER, #HASHTAGS"
1320: Walmart,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1320:_Walmart,social_networking,"What I really want is to hang out where I hung out with my friends in college, but have all my older relatives there too.","This comic satirizes the way in which large social networks, such as Facebook and Google+, attempt to aggregate all aspects of the user's online social presence. Earlier social networks had more granular focuses; e.g. MySpace originated with a music focus, and even earlier various bulletin board systems were centered around specific topics. By contrast, many social media companies attempt to encapsulate the variety of aspects of their users' online lives, thereby aggregating their personal, professional, and private lives in a way that was previously unlikely to occur.  The first comparison to Walmart, a large multi-national ""big box"" retailer that sells everything from gardening supplies to televisions to groceries, is apt because Walmart, too, is attempting to aggregate various aspects of your life into a single location - but rather than aggregating your social media presence, it's attempting to aggregate your shopping habits.  The punch line of the joke is that social interactions at Walmart are awkward, contrived, and frequently undesired — just as they can grow to become in a social network that is insufficiently focused or too bloated. People communicate differently with different groups of people, and if they are attempting to connect with friends, they are unlikely to want their grandparents present. Similarly, if a person is attempting to buy groceries, he may not be interested in extended small talk with acquaintances with whom he may not share much in common (perhaps the fact that they both shop at Walmart is the biggest similarity they share).  The title text elaborates on this idea by sarcastically implying that he wants all his older relatives to hang out where he hung out in college, likely causing extreme awkwardness.","When a network tries to become everyone's one-stop hub, the Walmart of social interaction... [Cueball and Hairy standing in a supermarket, Cueball holding groceries under his arm, Hairy with a cart.] Cueball: Oh, uh, hi! Funny running into you here. Hairy: Oh, hey! Yeah! How've you been? ...it inevitably becomes the Walmart of social interaction."
1362: Morse Code,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1362:_Morse_Code,social_networking,"Oh, because Facebook has worked out SO WELL for everyone.","Cueball recounts the last message sent in morse code by the French maritime radio station Le Conquet radio upon retiring its 500 kHz channel.  The poetic, and potentially angsty-sounding nature of the message reminds him of the on-line journal website LiveJournal, which was popular until the late 2000s (it was launched in 1999), and stereotypically used by angst-ridden teenagers to post song lyrics, poems, or cryptic messages to express their emotions and possibly fish for attention. Since Cueball never uses his LiveJournal account any more, he wonders if he can find the password again. He might be considering posting the final Morse Code message as his own last and final message on his LiveJournal.  The popularity of the site died down considerably with the arrival of social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook, Google Plus and the advent of microblogging platforms like Twitter and Tumblr. LiveJournal has also lost a lot of users since a Russian company bought them out; Russian dissidents used LiveJournal to present their opinions, and the Russian government used to retaliate by creating ""denial of service"" attacks which make LiveJournal unusable for all its users, sometimes for days. Nowadays (May 2014) LiveJournal is still quite popular among Russian-speaking people, including dissenters, but its administration was forced to show HTTP 451 error in some cases (e. g., when a user with a Russian IP is trying to read Alexei Navalny blog) with new laws. Thus when Megan is upset with his desire to let LiveJournal die out like the Morse Code, Cueball describes it as ""a nice place to go for some peace and quiet"".  The title text is Megan's (or Randall's) sarcastic remark indicating that Facebook is no less filled with angst-ridden thoughts than LiveJournal was, nor is it free from problems or controversies around other issues such as security or privacy.  Randall is no stranger to LiveJournal. xkcd started on LiveJournal [1] before xkcd.com was created and is even still alive today [2].  The Morse code for the final message ""this is our final cry on 500 khz before eternal silence"" is:  A period is a very short tone while the hyphen represents a slightly longer one. Between each character there is a small pause.

1390: Research Ethics,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1390:_Research_Ethics,social_networking,"I mean, it's not like we could just demand to see the code that's governing our lives. What right do we have to poke around in Facebook's private affairs like that?","This comic references the recent revelation that Facebook engaged in a ""psychological experiment"" by selectively showing users more ""positive"" or ""negative"" posts on their news feed and recording the users' comments to see if the change affected the positivity or negativity of their posts. Further experiments have since been revealed such as one that tested security measures by locking users out of their accounts.  Here, Megan is commenting on the fact that, while the media is calling this control over what content the user sees ""unethical,"" Facebook, and other companies like Google, must, one way or another, control what content the user sees, whether to present users with a limited selection of all postings, or to tailor ads to particular users; even if the regular algorithms are not set up for psychological experiments, they are still ""manipulating"" what posts users see or don't see. As Megan points out, no one really knows what the ""normal"" constraints are of the algorithm which chooses which posts are shown on news feeds. This comic is parodying the strong reaction to what is basically already a common practice.  Accumulation, control and analysis of user-generated information can be a part of the terms of service/end-user license agreement of a Website or software. In such a scenario, the user has effectively signed his/her consent to being part of such research. Unfortunately, most users don't read the terms before clicking the ""I agree"" option, so it can come as a shock when the service uses the data in a way the user hadn't anticipated.  The title text ironically/sarcastically accepts that Facebook has access to all of its users thoughts through posts and photos, and they can read them for research or other purposes, but contrasts this with a suggestion which likely mirrors how Facebook would respond to such a request that Facebook's code is private and can not be revealed to us. The title text basically appears to be musing that this is backwards, and our personal data should be considered MORE private than Facebook's programming code, which may be proprietary, but is not personal private data.  It is as if your neighbor was spying on you while you left all your shades open, but you felt it to be inappropriate to find out what he knew about you because that's his business. Asking for the source code might similarly be equivalent to asking for the specifications of the binoculars your neighbor used for spying.","[Megan is facing Cueball and Ponytail.] Megan: Facebook shouldn't choose what stuff they show us to conduct unethical psychological research. Megan: They should only make those decisions based on, uh... Megan: However they were doing it before. Megan: Which was probably ethical, right?"
1482: NowPlaying,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1482:_NowPlaying,social_networking,"If you click on the post, it takes you to search results for the note on various online music stores.","There are a variety of applications that post a user's music-listening habits on their preferred social network. In this comic, Randall takes that notion to its extreme, envisioning a program that does this note-by-note, rather than just song-by-song. As songs play several dozen notes a minute (and some songs, many more), this would lead to the flooding of friends' notification streams. In the example, the software is sharing the notes that Brian is listening to; and his friends Mike and Caitlin are getting annoyed with the number of posts they are receiving.  There are typically many hundreds of notes in any song.  Any song with more than a single line of music contains multiple different notes whose names according to the English convention are communicated here. All but the slowest songs will require reporting dozens to hundreds of notes every minute (a single glissando may cover a dozen or more notes in less than a second), meaning that anyone who can see your stream of posts will be literally inundated by posts from the service. Even if you could keep up with the speed of the posted notes that someone is listening to, the similarity in phrases in many songs (especially pop songs, e.g. Pachelbel's Rant) means that many different songs may include the same sequence of notes, though possibly in different octaves or at different speeds.  The comic's title alludes to the fact that you can ""play a song"" but can also ""play a note."" It may also allude to the visual similarities between the hash/pound/number sign (#) and the sharp sign (♯). C sharp, above Mike's comment, is the only note not given by a single letter (after the correction - see Trivia).  The title text continues the joke of this new musical service: If you click on the post, it takes you to search results for the note on various online music store. Since many songs in similar keys contain at least some of the notes posted, you would be given a list of a large part of the music you can buy in any on-line music stores. Of course this is at least as useless as being told which note someone is listening to.  They appear to be the beginning of I'll Be There For You by The Rembrandts, the title music of the TV series ""Friends"".  This could be an internal reference to the idea that it ""notifies"" (converts into musical notes) your ""friends"" of the notes (a play on words). Alternatively it could simply be an instance of effective nerd sniping.","[A social network news feed with user images for each of the three different contributors.

1608: Hoverboard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard,social_networking,,"The ""comic"" is actually a browser game made to celebrate the release of Randall's new book, Thing Explainer, which was released on the same day as this comic: Tuesday November 24, 2015. The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The title refers to a hoverboard (which resembles a hovering skateboard without wheels) which has been most prominently featured in the movie Back to the Future Part II, which took place in the future, until a little more than a month before this comic was released. Marty McFly traveled to the future in this second installment, more precisely to 2015-10-21, and this comic was released just over one month later 2015-11-24. Hoverboards are just one of many things predicted in Back to the Future Part II that hav e come to pass before reaching the date from the movie, but are more uncommon in our world, along with other inventions like flying cars and musical clothing. Randall is known to have had electric skateboards, which is also thematically related, although another type of hoverboard would be mentioned just five weeks later in 1623: 2016 Conversation Guide. Given Randall's enjoyment of movies and time travel it is very likely that this game is also a tribute to the Back to the Future movies. But the release day of the game has been used to promote his new book (as is clear with the text in the start screen of the game), and this explains why it was not released on the Back to the Future date. Apart from the date of release and the text about the book, the game does not seem to have any direct relation to the book; there are, however, several scenes in the game that could be seen as references to Thing Explainer. Instead the main part of the game is all the references to several movies and other stuff that has often been featured in xkcd as well as many of the other comics.","[This transcript only covers the starting page as shown on xkcd: xkcd 1608.

A bot replying to comments with ""woosh"" at random would be very confusing, as people would search for the nonexistent joke they missed. This is similar to 559: No Pun Intended.  ""Comment of the year,"" just like the original bot reply, could be taken two ways but both would likely cause confusion. Either the reader takes the ""CotY"" at face value, implying that the original comment is extremely significant, or as a sarcastic quip, which would give it basically the same meaning as ""woosh"", suggesting that the commentor had an unoriginal or ridiculous idea.  ""Are you for real"" implies that the commenter (the bot) doesn't believe that the original commenter is serious. It could also imply that the person to whom the bot is replying to is a famous celebrity, and the commenter wants to know if the person who posted the original comment is a real celebrity and not fake, but this seems unlikely given the context.  ""I'm taking a screenshot so I can remember this moment forever"" either adds an implied air of extreme importance, hilarity or significance to a comment, or sarcastically suggests that the comment was unoriginal, useless, or otherwise unimportant. People who read it might assume that there is a hidden joke or meaning somewhere inside the original comment.

1642: Gravitational Waves,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1642:_Gravitational_Waves,social_networking,"That last LinkedIn request set a new record for the most energetic physical event ever observed. Maybe we should respond. ""Nah.""","Megan, Cueball, and Ponytail are observing the results from a gravitational wave detector (see details below). This comic came out on the day that the first direct observation of gravitational waves was publicly announced on 2016-02-11. The actual event was recorded five months before on 2015-09-14, but it was not reported publicly before they were sure it was a real signal. It seems that Randall knew in advance about this announcement because this comic was published on a Thursday, not following the normal publish schedule, to coincide with the announcement, and there were no other comics released Friday that week. (The altered schedule could be viewed as a meta-reference to the warping of spacetime.) That scientists knew there might be an announcement on the way, and more details for the interested can be seen in these two videos from Space Time: Have Gravitational Waves Been Discovered?!? and LIGO's First Detection of Gravitational Waves! (See also their follow up The Future of Gravitational Waves).  This is the second time within a month that a new astronomical announcement (of something discovered months before the actual announcement) has resulted in a related comic. The first being 1633: Possible Undiscovered Planets.   From the patterns in the gravitational waves detected by this instrument, it might be possible to guess the nature of the event (e.g. two bodies with dissimilar masses circling a fixed point, two bodies with equal mass circling each other, collision of two massive bodies, etc.). It might also be possible to triangulate the location of the event. Based on these two facts (the location and nature of the event) we might be able to determine which astronomical bodies caused this event (and the status of those bodies afterwards). Thus, it provides an additional medium to observe the universe in addition to telescopes observing all kinds of electromagnetic radiation. This new medium might enable us to observe properties that we couldn't observe with the rest of our observation instruments.  However, the scientists in this comic appear to be receiving more than the expected signals from black hole collisions, they also receive gravitational spam messages, such as invitations from Linkedin, a mortgage offer, and an announcement of a social meet-up, rather than observing astronomical events (see table below).  There is also a joke on the social meet-up's use of the word local group because the 'Local Group' is also the technical name for the group of galaxies containing the Milky Way.  It is not clear if these so-called ""events"" are causing gravitational waves to be generated or if something, perhaps an alien civilization, is encoding spam messages in gravitational waves. It is plausible that aliens are using gravity waves to encode their messages, as we do something similar with electromagnetic waves to encode and send our messages. However, it would take an extremely advanced civilization to achieve gravity wave encoding. It requires the controlling of orbits and oscillations of super-massive bodies like the Sun, or more likely bodies ten times more massive than it. For example, the first event detected, both in this comic and in real life, was a merger of two black holes of roughly 30 solar masses each.  The title text makes the speculation, that something is sending spam encoded in gravity waves, seem more plausible, as it follows up with a joke that the message senders have gone to such a length that they caused the most energetic event recorded ever (perhaps on the scale of a few supernovae or black hole collisions). One of the scientists is so impressed with this effort that he suggests that they actually post a reply, but one of the other person declines with a ""Nah""! (As you should always do with spam, else you will just encourage the sender by making it clear that there actually is a receiver on this address.) Randall may have been referring to the fact that the detected event had a power output equal to 50 times that of the entire visible universe.  In 1365: Inflation gravitational waves are also mentioned.  A gravitational wave detector is a device used to measure gravitational waves, small distortions of spacetime that were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916. Gravitational waves are ripples in the spacetime fabric itself.  In layman terms, a gravitational wave is like moving a stone through water while partly submerged. It will cause waves on the surface of the water as it moves through it. These waves will spread away from the center of disturbance and as they move, they will cause the water molecules to oscillate around their mean positions. Similar waves are created in the space-time fabric when two celestial bodies interact with each other. If you concentrate on an area of the fabric far away from the point of disturbance, it can be observed that if the wave causes compression in one direction, it'll cause expansion of the fabric in the other. See this page for nice animations.  Note that anything with a mass will cause a gravitational wave. Just as waves created by small stones are tiny in comparison to waves created by huge rocks in water, the waves from humans moving around will be tiny compared to the waves created by celestial bodies. Also, the bigger the body, the stronger the wave and the farther away it can be detected. That is why we can only detect gravity waves from heavy bodies like black holes or neutron stars but not from us moving around.  Now, let's consider spacetime fabric as a thin rubber sheet. If you mark any two points on this sheet and stretch or compress it along the axis joining those two points, the relative positions of these points with respect to their neighboring points do not change, but the distance between them changes.  LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is a large-scale physics experiment designed to detect this compression/expansion, and it was LIGO who discovered the signal that caused this comic. (For a very detailed description of what the team at LIGO did and the history behind see this 90 minutes feature Gravitational Waves: A New Era of Astronomy Begins from the 2016 World Science Festival).  Two facts need to be remembered to easily understand the experiment. First, the speed of light (c) is constant and the speed of an object is the distance moved divided by the time taken to travel that far. Second, gravitational waves cause opposite effects (compression and expansion) in directions perpendicular to each other. At LIGO, an experiment is set up where two perpendicular long tunnels are constructed with apparatus to emit and detect laser beams. The beam from a laser is split into these two tunnels. After going through the tunnel and back again a few times the beams are brought back together. The lengths of the tunnels are set up in such a way that, in the absence of gravity waves, destructive interference between the two combined beams causes them to cancel one another out, resulting in the detector observing zero light intensity. When the gravitational wave passes through earth, one of the tunnel is expected to expand while the other is expected to compress. Due to the difference in lengths, the destructive interference is incomplete and the detectors will be able to detect the presence of light. This observation can be concluded as ""detection of the gravitational wave passing through"".","[Cueball, with arms up, is standing behind Megan who has her hands at her mouth, and who in turn is standing behind Ponytail, who is sitting in front of a large computer console with a screen, a keyboard, and several items on the side (presumably lights and labels).

1645: Toasts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1645:_Toasts,social_networking,Platonic solids for my real friends and real solids for my platonic friends!,"A toast is a ritual in which a drink is taken as an expression of honor or goodwill. The term may be applied to the person or thing so honored, the drink taken, or the verbal expression accompanying the drink. Thus, a person could be ""the toast of the evening,"" for whom someone ""proposes a toast"" to congratulate and for whom a third person ""toasts"" in agreement.  The comic is based on the quote Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends which, though often attributed to the painter Francis Bacon or to Tom Waits, is a toast dating back to at least the nineteenth century. It is also the entire title of a song, the ninth track on From  Under the Cork Tree, a 2005 album by Fall Out Boy.  The comic plays on a permutation structure between two words (a type of chiasmus), yielding puns with various effects.  In this comic eight persons drink a toast for their ""real friends"" and then for some other type of ""friends"". For the real friend they wish them to have one specific thing. This something is a word (X-Y) that can be split up in two meanings (X and Y), where one of them are then put in front the word friend, to explain what type of friends they are now toasting (often a bad/false type of friend) and then these friends get a wish for having what the word that are left of the original word means: ""X-Y for my real friends and real Y for my X friends""  The first example is a typical toast, in Champagne, where this word can be split in the two phonetically similar words Sham and Pain, and the sham friends then get pain. Below all examples (including the ninth from the title text) are listed with explanation for all words. In some cases the word may actually refer to a drink (like the first with champagne), so that the first word is not something wished for the real friends, but the drink that is in the glass (these have been mentioned below). But for other toasts there is no such drink in existence, and the first word is the thing the toaster wishes for the real friends.","[There are two rows of 4 panels each.

The web searches he makes tell what happens next, i.e. the bot balloons in complexity until it starts following its own goals and Cueball no longer has any control over its actions.  This comic examines how a seemingly simple task can often balloon in complexity if all of the requirements are not understood, while at the same time presenting the stereotypical scenario where an unassuming idea results in the accidental creation of malevolent AI, which then attempts to destroy humanity.  The story, as told by the web searches, is as follows:","[Cueball is sitting at a desk using a laptop, his thoughts shown above in a thought bubble.

1656: It Begins,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1656:_It_Begins,social_networking,You can also try 'Yikes.',"This comic encourages the reader to post random news stories on the Internet, under the line ""It begins."" This creates a sense of impending doom, as well as making people wonder what, exactly, is being referred to. This could also encourage people to theorize about what, exactly, is beginning. It could also just confuse the intended audience, as they try to comprehend what the author is saying.  This could in the worst case speedily lead to several people making repost of such a non-news story that would not have gotten any attention otherwise. This may lead to speculation, and other curious theories, going out the tangent it could create fear or mass hysteria.  Some stories that might benefit especially from this are those relating to machine autonomy, animal attacks, disease, and so forth. This would call to mind various popular culture and/or scientific hypothetical scenarios.  Perhaps the comic's choice of article refers to Alfred Hitchcock's thriller The Birds, in which birds (especially seagulls) begin attacking humans for no apparent reason, or the broader idea of an animal revolution, or just that even animals get sick of us always looking at our smart phones.  The title text instructs readers to try the line ""Yikes"" instead. The idea is the same but would give a completely different response.  Other comics which advocate using catch-all phrases as standard responses for any comment:","[A post in Megan's news feed on some social network platform is shown.

1689: My Friend Catherine,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1689:_My_Friend_Catherine,social_networking,I can't get any work done because my friend Catherine is sitting on my keyboard.,"This is another comic using substitutions to create the joke by replacing words or phrases, in this case ""My cat"", with a different word or phrase, in this case ""My friend Catherine"" (hence the title). The choice of the name is probably because ""Cat"" is a common nickname for ""Catherine"".  By doing so in a list of people discussing things their cat did, it makes it seem like they are discussing things their female human friend did.  What is cute (sitting on keyboards), impressive (doing backflips to eat bugs), or at least normal behavior for a cat (vomiting hairballs) would often be weird, disgusting or disturbing if an adult human were to do it, which is what makes the substitution humorous.  The comic depicts a feed on a page for people discussing their cat, similar to Twitter or Facebook, which would be the only kind of place where the substitution is really funny. Apart from known characters like two looking like Cueball, Megan and Ponytail, there is also a person with black hair, not looking particularly like any standard characters, and then a person with a knit cap, which could be the same knit cap wearing user that was also used in 1506: xkcloud (see the  pictures of the users).","[Captions above the frame:] New favorite substitution: My Cat→My Friend Catherine  [A news feed with comments by six different people discussing their cat, but after the above substitution.

1711: Snapchat,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1711:_Snapchat,social_networking,"For obvious reasons, the prize is awarded at a different time of year from the others, while it's still fresh in the committee's memory.","Snapchat is a photo-sending app that allows the receiving user to only view the photo (known as a ""snap"") within 24 hours of its posting, and for only 10 seconds before it is deleted. The Pulitzer Prize is famously awarded for exceptional journalism and photojournalism (there are many categories; see here).  Cueball reads that the Snapchat Pulitzer Prize has just been awarded but then, when Megan states that she heard the picture was really good, Cueball becomes disappointed because he realises he has already missed out on the chance to see the prize winning entry due to the temporary nature of Snapchat. Note that Megan also missed the opportunity to see the snap.  A given snap can be sent to a semi-public ""Story"" and the user decides how long any user can see the snap in a range from 1-10 s. In principle, any specific snap is only accessible for 24 hours even if it is a story. A committee of users could have more than 10 seconds to access the snap, by viewing in sequence. Given the time it might take for a committee to decide which snap wins the prize, it is realistic that Cueball learns about the winner after the 24 hours is up; Thus even a user following the outcome might not be able to see the winning entry after that time. In practice it is possible to circumvent the Snapchat rule and take a screen shot or in other ways save the content of the snap. In the case of a Pulitzer Prize winning photo, someone would probably have saved it, if it was in real life. On the other hand, the only way for the photo to be recognised as a snap, eligible to win the prize, would be if no one could see it for more than 10 seconds. So one of the possible rules might be that any picture which was saved would not be able to win the prize.  The title text extends this ephemeral nature of Snapchat's content to the prize awarded for it: The other Pulitzer prizes are announced annually in April and awarded in May (except for 2016, the centennial year, when an awards dinner will be held in October). The Snapchat Pulitzer Prize alone must be awarded as quickly as possible after the winner has been decided, before the prize committee forgets what the winning picture looked like. This of course underlines how silly this idea is, because only images seen during the assembly of the prize committee can be seen and remembered, and it is not possible to arrange this based on any knowledge of when a Pulitzer Prize ""worthy"" snap will be released.  Randall could be making fun of Snapchat (see the title), and the idea that you cannot save the images for later; As mentioned regarding screenshots, it is actually very easy to save pictures from Snapchat - to many a user's regret after having sent something very personal, such as naked pictures of themselves. The comic could also be seen as mocking the Pulitzer Prize for having too broad a spectrum of categories. Alongside the (photo)journalistic and prose awards, the Pulitzers also honor a variety of artistic pursuits, including Poetry, Drama and Music.  The new medium of Snapchat is certainly a hybrid form of art and information/opinion dispersal, both at its best and at its worst, but it is too ephemeral for awarding prizes to be logistically possible even if it were taken seriously enough for someone to want to award them.  The very next comic, 1712: Politifact, features an organization which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2009.","[Cueball and Megan standing together. He holds a smartphone in his left hand and looks at it.] Cueball: Oh, the Pulitzer Prize for Snapchat was just awarded. Megan: Yeah. Megan: I hear the photo was really good. Cueball: Aw, maaaan..."
1757: November 2016,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1757:_November_2016,social_networking,"Once you've done this, make a note of how old they were. Then, when their age reaches double that, show them this chart again.","This is yet another comic designed to make you feel old, following soon after the last one 1745: Record Scratch. Not so long ago a comic with the very title of the largest bold letters in the caption above the panel was released: 1686: Feel Old. The next comic about feeling old, was released 11 months later, with a similar title, which is special in it self, 1898: October 2017 see more on both title and this follow up comic in the trivia section below.  Specifically this comic contains The November 2016 Guide to making people feel old. (The  unusual title for the comic indicates that it only works during this month). It lists ages between 16 and 41 and links each age to one or more events that happened approximately half that age ago, so 8 years ago for the 16 years old and 20 years ago for the 40 years old etc, which means that a person of that age would have had the mentioned thing in their life for the majority of their life. And then it explains that to make a person of a given [age] feel old, look up the [thing] (or things) connected to it, and say:      As an example the age 21 can be used, as it list both the Xbox 360 as well as this comic, xkcd itself. The two possible sentences would then be:  This matches earlier attempts to make people feel old by mentioning how long ago it was that, for instance, a movie comes out as was the case in 891: Movie Ages. (But on this exact day when the comic was released there might have many people who did already feel old an tired - see trivia). When an event seems to have occurred recently to you, like seeing a movie when you were twenty (with Toy Story) and then suddenly realizing that this was 21 years ago, you will very likely feel old. Since humans' perception of time is not related to how much time has actually passed but rather to important memories, then memories like seeing the first feature-length fully computer-animated movie (Toy Story) makes a big impression and may stay vivid in peoples' memories. When they then, after hearing the sentence from this comic, realize that more than half their life has passed since that event, they realize how much time has passed and that makes them feel old.  This is why it affects a 20-year-old to hear that Twitter is ten years old, where this will not have the same impact on a 16-year-old, since they were so young when it came out that they probably feel like it has been around for ever, and you do not feel old by hearing, for instance, something like that the TV was invented before you were born. It thus makes sense to pick something that happened almost midway through a person's life, because they then realize they are now double as old as when they first heard of Twitter. Of course also many ten years old would not have been active on Twitter when it was released, so it may not have that big an impact on those 20 years old today.  Actually many of the chosen things are something that Randall specifically has interest in and several of the chosen events or movies relates to things that are recurring subjects in xkcd, as can be seen by the long list of categories that belongs to this comic. And while movie series like Star Wars, The Matrix, X-Men, Shrek and Toy Story are probably well known to most of xkcd readers as are games like The Sims and Pokémon, books like Harry Potter and comics like Calvin and Hobbes, then there are other things that are either only known to xkcd readers, basically not to anyone or at least not to people who where only 8-12 years old when the thing occurred. And if the person was not even aware of the specific thing existing, or at least not aware of it at the time when it was new, then the impact of saying the sentence to them will be little to none. Basically the first three ages, 16-18 years, would fall into this category. At 8 years old you are not supposed to play any version of Grand Theft Auto (not that some might not do it), and Rickrolling is also mainly for young adults, not 8-9 years old children. Worst of all is the reference for age 18 to the, probably mostly unknown, movie Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, which is directed at adults, and thus definitely not at those children that where 9 years old when it was released.    Nintendo Wii for people at 10 years old is the first that might make an impact, as will Xbox 360, but then again not xkcd, which is not directed at 10-11 years old children. But, the entire comic is mainly made to make readers of xkcd feel old by letting them know how long all these items are. But for the big movies and events that most people know about, it might also work on people not interested in xkcd. See more regarding if the sentence would work or not in the table below.  The joke at the end is that people over 41 don't need anything to make them feel old, because they already feel old. He thus teases people above 41 years old by claiming they are old, although many people (above 40) would claim you are not old before you retire. This trick was also used to cap the above mentioned 891: Movie Ages to 35 years old, stating anyone as older was already old. But that comic was also released five years ago, and now Randall is himself closing in on 35 at 32 years at the time of this comics release. So he pushed the limit 6 years further, probably for this reason. Now he no longer thinks people at 36 are too old to try to make them feel old.  It may be a coincidence, but still interesting, that he stopped the list just before 42, a number Randall has referred to many times in relation to it being the ""Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"" in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  For something to have existed for the majority of someones life, it is supposed to be older than half the persons age, but it seems Randall went for just about half the age. For instance for a 35-year-old person (born 1981), it lists the release of the movie The Matrix, which was released March 31, 1999 making it very close to 17.5 years ago, fitting with half of 35 years. For the 41-year-old it is slightly more than half of their life that has included the movie Toy Story, which was released almost exactly 21 years before this comic in November 1995, compared to the 20.5 years from half of 41 years. The only entry on the list that seems to veer more than half a year from the half age is  the one for autotuned hit songs which seems to refer to 1998, maybe specifically starting with Cher's song Believe released on October 19, 1998, making it 18 years ago. But it is listed together with the age 33 years, which should thus have been connected with something around 16.5 years old (16-17 years). However, this entry is also one of the less time specific. However, the rule still applies, it's just the only one where it is such a big majority of the persons age (18 years in their life 15 years not in their life). See more in the table below.  The title text points out that the same chart can be used for the same person once they are twice as old. So it urges the user to note down the age of the person it was used on, and then wait until their age reaches double that. So for a 16-year-old that would only be 16 more years until they are 32, but for a 41-year-old it would have to wait until they are 82 years old. When showing them this chart, they will realize that this has existed for half of their life and again have the same type of ""feeling old"" that this comic is supposed to instigate today.(It will work better if they still remember the joke made on them those many years ago)...","[Caption above the panel:] The November 2016 Guide to making people feel old  [A chart with a list of items to be put into the two first lines above the chart.

1761: Blame,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1761:_Blame,social_networking,I bet if I yell at my scared friends I will feel better.,"Cueball states that he feels sad and links it with his observation that bad things are happening. Sadness is a normal human reaction to perceived bad events[1]. (Other emotions that might be felt at such times include anger and guilt.)  He then reasons that it must be someone's fault. If the ""bad things"" in question are not natural calamities or accidents, it is usually logical to surmise that someone is responsible for them taking place.  After some thinking, he has an idea. Ideas are usually the result of thinking (unless they are a result of computers[citation needed]), although it might not always be conscious thinking like Cueball is doing.  He then blames his ""friends on Facebook"", a social media website and app, for connecting with and talking to friends and family. While there could be possible reasons for bad events (for example if the bad event was nobody wishing him a happy birthday or someone posting compromising pictures,) his friends would not be a likely source for bad events extending beyond a personal or local scope. Most people have a few hundred (or thousand) ""friends"" on Facebook, most of whom do not have enough influence to cause bad events on a national or global level.[citation needed]  This is a reference to people ranting on social media sites (like Facebook) about various things which are blamed on certain people (or sometimes everyone), but the person doing the ranting never thinks that the problem might be with themselves.  It could possibly also be a reference to how an individual's Facebook news feed has probably been inundated by political posts due to the results of the recent 2016 United States presidential election where Donald Trump won, less than two weeks before the release of this comic. Just before the election Randall had shown his supported for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in the comic 1756: I'm With Her. That this is indeed the reason is further supported by several other sad comics that followed later. These also seemed related to the election of Donald Trump. But this comic was the first. The second 1773: Negativity can actually be seen as a direct follow up to this comic. Because in that one Cueball finally goes outside his house to avoid all the negativity on-line (probably worsened when he blamed his friends for the bad things happening!).  One read on this is that, many people, including some news sources, have pointed out that social media forms an ""echo chamber"", and some sources have claimed that this is responsible both for political polarization (see this video) and even for the recent victory of Donald Trump in spite of Randall's endorsement of Hillary. Therefore, blaming social media for the election can be read as blaming his friends echoing his ideas back to him as causing (partially) Clinton's loss; thus they are (partially) at fault for his presumed sadness over her loss in the election.  A second read on this would be that constant reminders of Clinton's loss only serve to make Randall sadder: again the proximal cause being his friends' posts.  A third read would be that friends with whom Cueball/Randall disagrees are posting things that he finds unpleasant to read, either ideas that he finds offensive or inconvenient, or posts ""rubbing in"" the victory of the candidate Randall opposed.    The fourth meta-read is that Cueball (as very much distinct from Randall) is not especially smart, and Cueball's mistake here is something that Randall has seen other people make, and Randall is bitter that many people are making said mistake -- not only will venting on Facebook be counterproductive generally, in particular blaming your Facebook friends for the loss of your favored candidate will only make your interpersonal relationships more difficult, such venting will do nothing to correct the root cause of the sadness, partly because a small group of people is relatively powerless, and partly because the very nature of self-selecting Facebook friend-groupings forms a bubble of insular ideological uniformity.  Convincing yourself that your ideological allies are to blame, and then alienating your ideological allies by unfairly blaming them, is dumb; that is the point of the comic, that this ""bright idea"" that Cueball comes up with in panel three, is actually so dumb of an idea as to be humorous.    In real life, where Randall supported Hillary and is sad she lost, one might infer that Randall has seen real-life ideological allies blaming each other:  you should have worked harder for the campaign, you should have donated more, you never should have been mean to that Bernie supporter, you should have listened to me when I said we needed to get out the vote in Michigan, and so on and so on.  Finding a perceived problem, and then blaming your ideological allies as being the cause of that problem, makes it LESS likely that the actual problem will be corrected in future elections, thereby perpetuating the sadness.  Not only is Randall sad that his candidate lost the election, he is sad that Facebook 'friends' are accusing each other of being to blame, and he is expecting to remain sad in future election-cycles thanks to the disunity and infighting that were the byproduct of THIS election-cycle.  See also:  'vicious circle'.   Thus, the comic is actually intended to be entertaining, but also intended to have a moral lesson, like Aesop's fables:  if you lose an election because turnout for your candidate was lower across the board than in was in 2012 and 2008, picking fights with your ideological allies will not help you in 2020, because that will only further disunify the factions within your coalition.  The only way to increase turnout for one's preferred candidate, is to expand the coalition by bringing new voters -- and in some cases re-enticing former voters -- to join with you.  Difficult to do when you spend all your time blaming each other.  Somewhat ironically, this plain message is something that Randall cannot put forth... because telling your ideological allies that they need to stop blaming each other for the problems of the 2016 election-cycle, or they are gonna screw up the 2020 election-cycle, is in itself a way of blaming your allies!  Thus, the comic makes fun of people who blame their ideological allies for not being very bright, but also shows that Randall himself may not have been able to figure out what to do either... which is a cause for sadness, indeed, and one that cannot easily be corrected.  Even though Randall understands the problem, and can make humorous comics which illuminate the trouble, and poke fun at the counterproductive nature of blaming one's local allies for national or global setbacks, that does not mean he can keep people from falling into those counterproductive habits (himself included to some degree).   The title text refers to people venting. The (humorous) assumption here is that one will feel better after doing so. While some amount of venting might help to relieve stress caused by bad events, alienating people you know by blaming them for bad events usually causes more stress in the long run.  (See above explanation about how blaming ideological allies can become a vicious circle.) The fact that he recognizes his friends are scared, like him, but still thinks yelling at them is a good idea shows he's more interested in making himself feel better rather than caring about the well being on his friends.  Additionally, ""yelling"" on social media would likely only increase the influx of:   All of these would make him feel worse, potentially in relatively short order.","Cueball (thinking): I feel sad. Bad things are happening.  Cueball (thinking): They must be someone's fault. But whose?  [Cueball makes several thinking poses before a light bulb appears, indicating he has an idea]  Cueball (thinking): My friends on Facebook."
1765: Baby Post,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1765:_Baby_Post,social_networking,"[bzzzt] ""REMEMBER TO CHECK IN FOR YOUR FLIGHT TO LONDON."" ""My wha-"" [bzzzt] ""YOUR UBER WILL ARRIVE IN FOUR MINUTES.""","In this comic, Cueball is questioned about a series of posts made to his Facebook account.  Initially he explains the posts as the result of leaving his daughter (a baby, according to the title) unattended with his tablet.  Readers are meant to assume all posts were made by accident, which happens often to people with children.  This makes sense for the first two panels: sharing the same video six times could be the result of the child repeatedly hitting the same area of the screen (e.g. a ""share"" link), and the gibberish text ""FHFF,,,M,,,,"" could be due to the child randomly tapping on the screen as well, all without knowing what she has done.  The joke begins when Cueball discovers an apparent pattern in new posts, starting with a map of hardware stores and culminating in blueprints for the Tower of London.  These subjects, if they were chosen consciously by an adult, would strongly suggest the poster was planning a heist to steal the crown jewels.  It is very unlikely for a baby to be capable of designing and carrying out such a plan. [citation needed]  However, it is also very unlikely for these specific subjects to be posted all by accident.  The reader is thus left wondering what could have caused these posts, and whether Cueball and/or his daughter might know more than they let on.  Cueball's suggestion of ""keeping an eye"" on his daughter suggests he is seriously considering the possibility that she might be an evil genius.  The title text continues the joke by notifying Cueball that his flight to London is leaving soon, and an Uber driver is coming to pick him up. Since his daughter was using the tablet and he is surprised by the messages, this suggests she is in fact the mastermind who has already started executing her plan.  Either she is making the journey herself (and Cueball is only receiving notifications because he has the same accounts linked to his phone), or Cueball is being roped into the crime.  The crown jewels are famous in several movies for being overly complicated to steal, such as Minions. They are also mentioned in 1698: Theft Quadrants.  The comic is similar to 1419: On the Phone, though here it seems that the daughter isn't just a cover story. It is also somewhat similar to 576: Packages, in that Cueball seems weirder since it started.  [Ponytail is looking at something on her phone while talking to Cueball]  [Cueball is talking to someone on the phone while pushing a shopping cart with a few items in it]  [White Hat is holding his phone while walking with Cueball]  [Ponytail is looking at her phone while talking to Cueball]","Ponytail: Why did you post a The Wheels on the Bus Youtube video to Facebook six times? Cueball: Haha, whoops! My daughter was watching the tablet and must have hit something.  Phone: Hey, did you mean to post ""FHFF,,,M,,,,"" and a link to a map of hardware stores? Cueball: I should really look up how to lock the screen.  White Hat: You just posted videos on metal-working, zip lines, and camouflage. Cueball: Uhh...  Ponytail: Um, you posted blueprints of the Crown Jewel rooms in the Tower of London. Cueball: Maybe we should be keeping more of an eye on her."
1802: Phone,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1802:_Phone,social_networking,"[*disables social networking accounts*] [*social isolation increases*] Wait, why does this ALSO feel bad?","When someone asks you if you want to go for a walk they often expect to have a conversation, while enjoying both the exercise, the fresh air and the company. Thus any disturbance not related to the walk is not welcome. Going for a walk is often seen as a way to relax from all the daily stress, as it takes the walkers away from work and chores.   Cueball agrees to go for a walk, but not to all the associated expectations. His first instinct is to bring along his smartphone, though rather than call it such, he opts for a lengthy description detailing all the functions he intends to use. He describes the phone as a device that gives him a continuous (24/7) stream of information, much of which is often out of context. The stream contains people's opinions, context-free but scary news, and other random stimuli. Conspicuously, long-distance communication (ostensibly the primary function of a smartphone) is not listed. This may be a sign that Cueball is addicted to his phone.  The stream of opinions mentioned could be from news or bloggers but it could also just be from his friends on social media platforms. News stories that are shared on social media are often scary, which becomes even worse because news outlets are likely to use a title that exaggerates the topic to create a fear reaction. The random emotional stimuli could be from many things such as text messages/emails and pictures of kittens and babies on social network, and shared internet memes or viral videos. All things that could cause a quick shift in emotions.   As if all this was not enough, Cueball even says he will also take his spare battery, so he won't risk that his constant feed could be interrupted, because he will not be able to recharge his phone during the walk. All in all, his choice and constant need for staying updated and being online violates all the usual expectations, that his friend could have expected from asking him out for a walk. Randall's fear of running out of power on his smartphone was earlier mentioned in 1373: Screenshot, where a low battery charge stresses him too much to realize it is someone else screenshot, rather than his own phone that has a low charge.  The title text shows it would be possible to take an action to avoid this feed. In the first bracket a person (could be Cueball or Randall) disables all his social networking accounts. Most of his news feed will thus disappear. But this leads to the next bracket which states that such a choice would lead to increased social isolation, since he will no longer be in contact with any of his online friends. In fact, today many people also get into contact with their ""real"" local friends through social media, so one might thus miss out on events like parties or get-togethers.  In addition, his friends, not sharing his dislike for social media, may not understand his decision. All of this leads to the final sentence Wait, why does this ALSO feel bad?","[Someone off-panel asks Cueball a question which he answers while walking to a small table with some items laying on it.] Off-panel voice: Wanna go for a walk? Cueball: Sure, just need to grab my device that feeds me a 24/7 stream of opinions, context-free scary world news, and random emotional stimuli. Cueball: Plus a spare battery so the feed won't be interrupted."
1810: Chat Systems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1810:_Chat_Systems,social_networking,I'm one of the few Instagram users who connects solely through the Unix 'talk' gateway.,"The comic consists of an Euler diagram showing a wide variety of chat systems and their intersections. (Euler diagrams should not be confused with Venn diagrams, see more on this here). The comic demonstrates the complexity that can be involved in modern communications: simply remembering how to get in touch with someone can be a challenge.  Below is a table with explanation for all 24 mentioned chat systems and below that a list of each system's intersections with the other systems. Several of the systems are already considered old, like The ""chat"" tab in an old Google Doc, but some people keep using them, which is part of the joke. There only seems to be one ""chat"" system which could in no way be said to be an on-line chat system, and that is the Wall (bathroom) at the bottom, which refers to how people writes notes on public bathroom walls, making it an extra joke and possibly a reference to 229: Graffiti.  In the title text, Randall explains how he is one of the only few Instagram users to use the UNIX 'talk' gateway (an old peer-to-peer chat system whereby users logged into the same UNIX system could privately communicate with each other in a full-screen interface.) But he doesn't tell how he had enhanced this old fashioned software.  Note that this is similar to the earlier 949:_File_Transfer.  The 24 chat systems with the number of stick figures inside are listed. Notice there are only 23 real systems, as one of the systems is a bathroom wall.","[An Euler diagram with many circle like drawings for various chat systems is shown.

1886: Typing Notifications,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1886:_Typing_Notifications,social_networking,"Over the years I've decided I'd rather have them on than not, but I'm glad there aren't ""has opened a blank note to compose a reply to you"" notifications.","Randall has sent a message on an instant messenger to someone else and is now watching the screen expecting a reply. The message contains simple questions about a show Randall must have undertaken and he insists on an honest answer. The phone indicates that the respondent is typing a response, but then pauses, resumes typing, and pauses a second time, before sending a simple ""It was great!""  Typing notifications, often called ""typing awareness indicator"", is a feature of some instant messaging systems. It lets you know when the other person in a conversation is typing and preparing a reply. It may appear in different forms, like the literal text ""[Contact] is typing."" or often has a empty answer (possibly a different color) containing three animated dots. It gives the sender confidence that their message has been received and the other one is working on a reply.  When the final response is received it is anodyne ""It was great"", suggesting that the first two deleted drafts could be far more critical. The fact that you know that a message has been deleted or edited twice provokes you to imagine what the deleted drafts may have contained. The issue with typing notifications that Randall is talking about might also just be the difficulty to interpret them. The distant contact might just have been doing something else at the same time, started typing in the wrong conversation, or corrected a typo, but because Randall has interpreted the long pauses the same way one would read face-to-face interactions, the typing notifications make it seem like they weren't honest.  If one partner of a conversation takes their sweet time to reply, possibly deleting their text and starting from scratch as shown in this comic, the typing notification feature can lead to anxiety, as the person waiting for a response starts to overthink the issue. Thoughts come to mind like the other person might not be honest, try to carefully word a sensitive subject or not care enough about you to quickly reply. If finally the answer arrives and consists of just a laconic ""ok"" or similar, these feelings become even stronger, leading to thoughts like the other person is trying to hide something. This phenomenon has become so widespread that many people have written about it in newspapers and blogs, calling it texting anxiety.  The caption below the screens summarizes that what Randall dislikes the most about these systems of notification that the other party on the conversation is actively working on a reply is the lengthly alternation between indications that the other party is composing a reply, amidst pauses wherein one presumes the other party is thinking carefully about what they are wanting to say, then more typing as in response to their deep thinking, etc. until at the end of this extended period when one expects the other side to have written a book's worth of notes given the time and work they appear to have dedicated to the reply -- and all they get is a simple 3-word reply.  It leaves him wondering what all the other party really typed, and really thought, that they ended up not sending.  One way around giving your text receiver texting anxiety would be to open a blank note and work out what you want to say there. Since you're not typing in the messaging app, there's no typing notification.    In the title text, Randall expresses that he likes to watch when the recipient reacts and is trying to write an answer but he's also happy to not receive notifications that the texter is composing a response in a blank note file. Typically, one composes responses in blank notes when they need to be careful or thoughtful about how they respond. If Randall were to be notified about such actions, it would confirm his above fears that the writer was being tactful and guarded in their response, which would just lead to more anxiety about what they were trying to hide.","[A sequence of eight panels representing the same conversation in an electronic chat. The header always reads:] What did you think of my show? Did you like it? Be honest!

1911: Defensive Profile,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1911:_Defensive_Profile,social_networking,"NO DRAMA ZONE -> If I've made you sad, you'd better not tell me, because I am TERRIFIED of that situation and have NO IDEA how to handle it.","This comic demonstrates a theoretical feature which provides more honest interpretations of social media profiles. We see a profile for a person who says they have ""no filters"" and has no qualms about offending or upsetting anybody with their seemingly radical views. But the ""translation"" of the description reveals that it is a vastly insecure person who seems to have the problem of saying the wrong thing every time and so their profile description is a way for them to justify their comments.   The title text continues, with the aggressive ""NO DRAMA ZONE"" turning out to mean that the user is merely trying to keep any offended or genuinely upset comments away from their page because they simply have no idea how to emotionally handle hurting someone's feelings.   Randall previously demonstrated another theoretical feature to address passive-aggressive behavior in 1085: ContextBot.  The comic's feature may be based on the context menu option of the Google Chrome web browser to have a foreign language webpage translated to the user's selected native language. However, in Google Chrome, the user may only translate the entire page, while in this comic the user may also select some text and have only the selected part translated. Also, Google Chrome uses Google Translate for translation by default, which cannot read minds like in the comic.[citation needed] However, if one uses the official Google Translate extension for Google Chrome, one may actually translate only the selected text. It is possible then that it is instead the extension which inspired the comic's feature.  This comic not only illustrates such a feature, but implies that the ""translated"" thoughts are what's actually going on behind posts of these types on social media, as if Randall can actually read those people's minds somehow. If this implication is the intent of the comic, then Randall thinks that people who have ""no filter"" are actually insecure and that people who want ""NO DRAMA"" are actually afraid of upset comments. Alternatively, Randall hates people who post such things in their profiles, and therefore wants to belittle them in this comic as actually being insecure, rather than being as confident as their aggressive behavior implies. This explanation is corroborated by notable news near the comic's publishing time (see below).  The style of the profile showcased in the comic resembles the profiles of the popular social media website Twitter, which while the user is logged in, shows the user's own profile on the left side of the page in a similar style to the comic, with their picture on the left side of their name, their Twitter handle under their name (which explains the extra line of text under what is presumably the name) and their ""bio"" right below those. The Twitter ""bio"" is a space usually used for the user to explain who they are. Common details about a person which are included in their ""bio"" are their profession, their personal interests and the products they have for sale. Some people also write about their personality, such as the one in the comic, which is quite outspoken and frank about her opinions.  One notable news item regarding Twitter, near the comic's publishing time, is that a rogue employee of the Twitter company, on the last day of his job, banned the personal Twitter profile of U.S. President Donald Trump (it was undone 11 minutes later). While Donald Trump never wrote something similar to what the comic portrays on his Twitter profile, he is known to post ""politically incorrect"" statements there. Donald Trump does not seem to care about who those statements offend, just like the person in the comic. Randall is known to have supported the opposing candidate before he was elected, having made a comic just to promote her, and particularly sad comics following his election. These events may have inspired the comic.  The title of this comic is ""Defensive Profile"". ""Defensive"" is the opposite of ""offensive"", which is a word that might be used to describe the contents of profiles which display such a warning as in the comic. However, the feature reveals the warnings to actually be defenses against behaviors that deeply bother the profile owner. The profile is thus proved to actually be ""defensive"" instead of ""offensive"", at least regarding the warning text.","[A profile on an unknown social media site is displayed. The profile picture is a close-up image of Megan. The profile reads:]  I speak my mind and don't care who I offend. No filter.  [In the next panel, the text is highlighted, and a context menu has appeared. There is a mouse pointer on the option ""View translation"".] Copy Select all View translation [selected] Print  [In the last panel, the profile text is updated:]  I don't understand why people keep getting mad at me and I'm using this pep talk to convince myself that's okay."
1914: Twitter Verification,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1914:_Twitter_Verification,social_networking,"When we started distributing special status tokens that signify which people are important enough to join an elite group, we never could have imagined we might be creating some problems down the line.","Some Twitter users (such as Coldplay, or Donald Trump) have a verification checkmark next to their name.  This checkmark is used to indicate that the user is who they say they are, rather than being a fake account made by someone else using their picture and name. This helps fans find the real accounts of their favorite celebrities. However, since the most notable people benefit from this the most, there is some ambiguity in the granting of the verified mark, as it also seems to be interpreted as a status symbol to indicate the notable celebrities. Some even see this as Twitter actively endorsing the user. For this reason, Twitter has removed verified checkmarks from real accounts of celebrities because of political controversies in the past. Examples of this are political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos (before he was banned from the service). One recent controversial decision regarding the verified mark is that Twitter gave a verification checkmark to Jason Kessler, the organizer of a recent far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.  This drew attention to Twitter's verification system, so they temporarily suspended it.  The alt-text comments on the lack of foresight on Twitter's part when implementing the verified system: as it by design separates users between an in-group and an out-group, it seems to imply endorsement or, at least, favors some users to the detriment of others. This in turn automatically creates the twin sets of ""people who shouldn't have been verified, but were"" and ""people who deserve to have been verified, but weren't."" As the internet is populated by various large and strongly opinionated groups [citation not needed], neither set will ever be empty and Twitter will always be seen as either endorsing unworthy or snubbing worthy people.  The last line of dialogue is likely a pun on the Twitter Moments feature, which can be used to compile several tweets with a shared theme into a browsable gallery. The character depicted is the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, judging by the beard.","[A bearded figure, depicting the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is standing behind a podium with the blue Twitter bird logo.] Jack: Everyone calm down— Jack: We just need to go figure out how to bestow a global in-or-out status badge on some people, at our discretion, without anyone reading anything into who gets one.  Jack: This should only take a moment."
185: Wikifriends,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/185:_Wikifriends,wikipedia,"It's crazy how much my gut opinion of a movie/song is swayed by what other people say, regardless of how I felt coming out of the theater.","The comic's title refers  Wikis, which are collaboratively edited websites. The first such site was WikiWikiWeb, but Wikipedia (an online encyclopedia) has become the most well-known example, and may have been specifically what Randall had in mind, as other comics do reference Wikipedia.  The influence of social environment is called peer pressure, often with a negative connotation. The term ""Wikifriends"" is coined in the comic as a label for people who adjust their views in order to incorporate into a group. That is to say that, in the same way a Wiki page can be edited by people other than the original author, a ""Wikifriend"" allows their opinions to be ""edited"" by someone else. As an example, the comic shows a discussion about a movie in which one collocutor entirely veers in his opinion when he hears what his friend thinks.  The title text suggests that Randall also observes himself to be frequently influenced by others.",WikiFriends: [Two people are talking to each other.] Cueball: I really liked that movie. Friend: I hated that movie. Cueball: Me too.
214: The Problem with Wikipedia,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/214:_The_Problem_with_Wikipedia,wikipedia,Taft in a wet t-shirt contest' is the key image here.,"This comic illustrates the ""problems"" of information explosion coupled with a dense web of hypertext links. Through most of human history, written media has been both slow and linear. Hypertext allows a new type of information consumption, through small chunks of information linked together in a web of related concepts, and by being digital, each new chunk can be retrieved quickly and effortlessly. Wikipedia applies this principle very strongly, and because it covers so many topics, it is common for a reader to skim an article about a topic they need or want to know about, and end up following a series of links out of curiosity. Since each new page also has several links, the overall navigation pattern resembles a tree that branches out, ""exploding"" in size with each new level of link-clicking, thus resulting in many wasted hours (over three in this case) of reading stuff unrelated to the original goal, and lots of open browser tabs holding a wide variety of articles, which are seemingly unrelated, but have common ""ancestors."" (The problem, for Randall, of wasting time on Wikipedia was later referenced in the title text of 1501: Mysteries, and the more general problem of getting trapped following a never-ending chain of interesting links was covered in 609: Tab Explosion.) The large diversity in end links may also be a reference to the Wikipedia game.  One can also see this effect occur in other MediaWiki-powered wikis such as this very website, where one comic can lead to another of similar relation or category. In the table below, a possible route for each entry has been found.  Finding routes between the start and end points of the two pages above and the six below makes good challenges in the Wikipedia game.  The title text refers to two of the articles that were supposedly reached at the bottom. William Howard Taft was the 27th President of the U.S., in office from 1909 to 1913, who was notorious for being so overweight that he became stuck in the White House bathtub. A wet T-shirt contest is an exhibitionistic competition typically featuring young women contestants at a nightclub, bar, or resort. Clearly the combination of these two would be rather bizarre.  There is an online game that involves trying to get from one Wikipedia page to another in the shortest possible route: http://thewikigame.com/.  Due to the ever changing nature of Wikipedia, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge entry on Wikipedia no longer links to Structural collapse, requiring an intermediate step via Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940), and since Structural collapse now redirects to Structural integrity and failure, most pages on Wikipedia that linked to Structural collapse have been changed to rename this link.","[Heading above the chart:] The Problem with Wikipedia: [Text in a frame below the heading:] Tacoma Narrows Bridge [Lines lead down both left and right to two new frames with the following text:]  Suspension bridge  Structural collapse [Two more lines lead down from the left frame and one from the right frame, and each line ends on a wiggling line.

Wait, damn, original research.","The ""Choices"" series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday). It explores and marvels at human freedom. This is, however, a little sidetrack from the ""Choices"" narrative. Cueball is studying special relativity. The speed of light in a vacuum (299,792,458 m/s) is denoted as c. Megan and the spaceship are shown traveling at 0.2c in opposite directions. This would mean (in Newtonian mechanics) 0.4c relative to each other. But due to relativistic effects, their velocities do not simply add when the spaceship observes Megan; in reality, both would measure only 0.385c ( = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c2) ) from the other's point of view. Also, time dilation influences the way time is observed with reference to the two frames of reference. Megan, however, has other concerns. (This text and part of the image were completely reused in the space part of the interactive 1350: Lorenz (see image here).  In the title text, Megan thinks about writing about this after-worldly place in Wikipedia, but then realizes that the content would be removed, due to the Wikipedia policy on original research. Even though her claims would be true, she would need reliable written sources to support them.  All parts of ""Choices"":  As this was the second in the series, it was released on a Tuesday.","[Cueball is doing some exercises in a book.

285: Wikipedian Protester,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester,wikipedia,SEMI-PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION,"Cueball holds up a sign reading ""Citation Needed"" during a political speech. The sign text is based on the Wikipedia template that can be placed next to statements that need citations, usually because of questionable validity. Cueball is using this template to challenge the politician's speech.  The title text below the comic references semi-protection, a protection measure typical of Wikipedia, which basically protects some articles from being edited anonymously. Constitutional amendments cannot usually be proposed anonymously, meaning that in effect, all articles of constitution are semi-protected.","[There is a politician speaking at a podium, which sports an American flag.] [In front of the speaker there is a crowd of people listening.

333: Getting Out of Hand,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/333:_Getting_Out_of_Hand,wikipedia,"Wikipedia's role as brain-extension, while a little troubling, is also really cool.","Given how Wikipedia has an ever-expanding variety of topics, the grand majority of them in great detail, there is a possibility (even a temptation) of relying on Wikipedia to learn from every topic that leaves you confused... even foreplay. ('Bedtime' and 'us time' is not necessarily 'computer time'.)  This comic may also be a reference to how people can get addicted to reading Wikipedia pages, because there are many interesting links on each page that people haven't read yet, and there are links on that page that they click on, etc. This may be the reason that Cueball is reading Wikipedia instead of sleeping with Megan, because he got stuck in the link loop.  The title text refers to the fact that many rely on Wikipedia instead of remembering/learning stuff. This was later directly addressed as the subject of 903: Extended Mind","[A couple is in bed in the dark, and Cueball reaches out from under the covers to do a Wikipedia search about Foreplay.]"
444: Macgyver Gets Lazy,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/444:_Macgyver_Gets_Lazy,wikipedia,"At the time of this writing, Wikipedia has a wonderful article titled 'List of problems solved by Macgyver'","MacGyver was a 80s and early 90s TV character, famed for improvising complex devices in a matter of minutes in order to escape dangerous situations. In this comic MacGyver suggests an unusually direct plan—shooting the guard in the head. However, he still manages to describe his plan in a rather 'complex' manner.  It is worth noting that in the show, MacGyver was adamantly against the use of guns and never used one (at least, not for its intended purpose) in the entire run of the old series.  A MacGyver reboot was made in 2016, and was not well received (38% on Metacritic, 4.6/10 in iMDb). It has only one season so far.  The Wikipedia page referenced by the title text redirects to the main MacGyver entry since September 2012.

446: In Popular Culture,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/446:_In_Popular_Culture,wikipedia,"Someday, the 'in popular culture' section will have its own article with an 'in popular culture' section. It will reference this title-text referencing it, and the blogosphere will implode.","Wikipedia is a popular online encyclopedia with articles that are created and edited by the general public [citation required] . Wikipedia entries have many sections, with the first few explaining the general concept and details behind the subject.  When this comic was written many Wikipedia articles had a section at the end entitled ""in popular culture"", listing TV shows, movies, songs and so on which made reference to the subject at hand. In many cases, this list was extensive, possibly because the people editing the articles were such fans of the subject or the pop culture in which it is referenced, they couldn't help but go into great detail, listing many esoteric and seemingly irrelevant elements of pop culture which were peripherally related to the subject of the article. As an example, see the old article Apollo in popular culture which as of August 2007 redirects to Apollo.  The joke in this case is that even such a mundane article such as one on wood could have an ""in popular culture"" section and obviously, wooden items are common enough that there are any number of instances of popular culture which could be considered to ""reference it"", even if that's something as basic as a wooden item being used as a prop in a TV show. Such information would be of little or no use to anybody and only somebody obsessed with wood, a particular element of pop culture in which wood makes an appearance or the concept of placing pop culture references in encyclopedia articles would bother to create or maintain such a section.  Also, wood being such a popular material, the list of references could be virtually endless. This is a reference to the fact that the ""in popular culture"" sections of many Wikipedia articles contained dozens of items, even for articles on fairly arcane subjects. Note that the end of this particular ""in popular culture"" section is not visible so we don't know how long it is.  The title text states that in the future there will even have to be a wiki page with the subject ""In popular culture"". This article will also need an ""in popular culture"" section and it will be obvious to make a reference directly to this title text, as xkcd is part of popular culture and because this title text predicted the creation of and need for such a page. However this would then create a circular reference. This could be considered a form of infinite loop which is one way to cause a computer to crash (lock up). The joke is that the blogosphere could follow this endless train of circular links and itself crash, causing an ""implosion"".  This comic was mentioned in Wikipedia:""In popular culture"" content. However, on April 23, 2014, the reference was edited out. It has since been added under the external links section of Wikipedia:xkcd in popular culture.

545: Neutrality Schmeutrality,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/545:_Neutrality_Schmeutrality,wikipedia,"Hey, everyone, you can totally trust that I didn't do a word count on MY edit!'","Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia with content developed and submitted by volunteers around the world. In fact, its slogan is ""Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit."" Most articles on the site can be altered by anyone with access to Wikipedia.  Wikipedia has set some standards for its operation, which it refers to as the ""Five pillars of Wikipedia"". One of these pillars is titled ""Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view.""  Pro-life and pro-choice refer to two opposing viewpoints in the debate of the moral and legal rights concerning abortion. For many on both sides, it is a very emotional topic.  Black Hat has decided to prove that you can create an article which fundamentally cannot remain neutral. Since his charitable donation is determined by the word count of the article, any submission to Wikipedia must result in supporting either pro-life or pro-choice. And with a reward of one million dollars, it is unlikely that either side would allow an article to remain unedited which supported its opponent.  The title of the comic references an old (read, ""pre-Internet"") meme, possibly of Yiddish origin, known as shm-reduplication. The speaker replaces the initial consonant cluster (have it 0, 1 or even 2+ consonants) with the cluster ""schm"", read /ʃm/, and says the new word after the unadulterated word, as in the title where it is ""N"" that has been replaced. This denotes an active apathy or an intentional disregard of the authority (for it is usually an authority or someone in a similar position) being mocked. In this case, Black Hat is disregarding Wikipedia's neutrality doctrine with his word count dependent donation rule.  The title text is a statement from the Wikipedia author in an attempt to assert the neutrality of the submission, claiming no word count was performed before posting (an unlikely scenario).","[Above the frame:] Trivia: It's possible to create events which Wikipedia cannot cover neutrally [Black Hat is at a press conference in which he is making an announcement in front of a large crowd mainly of Cueballs but also some Megans.] Black Hat: In a week, I will be donating $1,000,000 to a recipient determined by the word count of the Wikipedia article about this event.

547: Simple,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/547:_Simple,wikipedia,"Actually, I think if all higher math professors had to write for the Simple English Wikipedia for a year, we'd be in much better shape academically.","There are three Cueballs discussing a particle accelerator. One Cueball asks the others about the ""tertiary Free-electron laser (F.E.L) guidance system"". As this is a fairly technical topic, we would expect a response filled with scientific jargon. The joke is that the other Cueball instead responds in a much simpler manner. He uses simple phrases such as ""smash the right things together"" and ""that would be very bad"".  As the caption below the comic notes, Cueball and/or Randall has spent the previous night reading the Simple English Wikipedia, a simplified version of Wikipedia intended to be easier to understand, and now he finds himself using similarly simple syntax. For example, the article for a particle accelerator describes it as ""a machine that makes really tiny things called particles travel at very high speeds."" This is similar to the simple response given by the responding Cueball. In the actual comic, Cueball was able to effectively communicate the dangers of using a broken F.E.L. using simple syntax similar to the style of the Simple English Wikipedia.  From the title text, Randall believes that if people teaching advanced mathematics followed this style, their subject would be more accessible. The implication is that more people would be drawn to studying mathematics and that (naturally) the world would be a better place because of this!  This concept was later revisited in 722: Computer Problems, 1133: Up Goer Five, (possibly most notably) Thing Explainer, and 1436: Orb Hammer.","[Three Cueball-like guys stand in front of a sketch.

TGI Friday's is an American multinational restaurant chain known for its casual family-friendly atmosphere, upbeat service, and fried appetizers. Megan's and Cueball's behaviour is of course highly inappropriate, due to the sanitation issues relating to sitting or laying naked on the tables, as well as public decency issues; nudity is illegal in most public places, and this is compounded by the fact that there are usually children in TGI Friday's. It is likely that the erection plate, is supposed to refer to a fear erection, created as a result of greater blood pumping from adrenaline  The message implicit in the comic (and stated outright in the title text) is that careful cropping can produce useful, apparently professional reference images, even if the source photograph was not taken in a professional manner, or was pornographic in nature.","Plate 15: Female breast [There is a drawing of a breast, with 'breast', 'areola', and 'nipple' labeled.]  Plate 16: External female genitalia [There is a picture of external female genitalia.

682: Force,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/682:_Force,wikipedia,Force-choking the chicken.,"This comic features Darth Vader, the main antagonist from the original Star Wars trilogy.   Autoerotic asphyxiation is a sexual practice in which lack of oxygen is induced to enhance sexual stimulus. The technique is considered extremely dangerous, especially without supervision, as loss of consciousness can result in continued strangling which can quickly be fatal.  In the films, Vader possesses the ability to restrict the airway of an opponent without having to touch them, using only the so-called ""force"". This practise has therefore been called force-choking. The comic assumes that Vader used this technique against himself, with the help of a mirror, in order to become sexually aroused.  Lord Vader has apparently force-choked himself to the point of unconsciousness (or possibly even death) and is being transported from his house on a stretcher by two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).  The title text is a pun on the term ""choking the chicken"", a colloquial expression referring to male masturbation. ""Force-choking the chicken"" might mean a technique of self-gratification by use of the ""force"" without having to apply one's hands.",[Two EMTs are rushing Darth Vader away from a front door on a stretcher.]  [There is a room with a desk in the foreground and a full-length mirror in the corner.

739: Malamanteau,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/739:_Malamanteau,wikipedia,"The article has twenty-three citations, one of which is an obscure manuscript from the 1490s and the other twenty-two are arguments on LanguageLog.","A malapropism is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical utterance.  An example of a malapropism is Yogi Berra's statement: ""Texas has a lot of electrical votes,"" rather than ""electoral votes"". A portmanteau is a word made-up of two or more combined words and their definitions. For example, motel is a portmanteau, from the words motor and hotel. A neologism is simply a newly coined word that is not yet in common use.   Here, Randall shows a hypothetical Wikipedia page of the word ""malamanteau"" which is both a portmanteau of ""malapropism"" and ""portmanteau"" and a malapropism of ""portmanteau"". Finally, ""malamanteau"" is itself a neologism because Randall invented the word when he wrote this comic. The methods used to create this new word are the very words used in the process. This is called a meta or ""self-referential"" joke.  ""Malamanteau"" was originally coined in 2007, when it was proposed by user ludwig_van on Metafilter as a term for language errors like ""flustrated"" (flustered & frustrated) and ""misconscrewed"" (misconstrued & screwed).   The bottom line of the comic (Ever notice how Wikipedia has a few words it really likes?) is a reference to the large number of Wikipedia pages that start by labeling their subject matter as a malapropism, a portmanteau, or a neologism.   In response to this comic, editors at Wikipedia created a malamanteau page. It was deleted multiple times and eventually turned into a redirect to the Wikipedia page for xkcd. Malamanteau and the controversy at Wikipedia got coverage at The Economist and The Boston Globe.  The title text refers to Wikipedia's requirements of citations for a page on there to exist. It also refers to the wide range of places citations can be obtained from, showing a direct opposition due to the use of very different citations (The Language Log arguments are modern and informal, whereas the obscure manuscript is formal and much older). Language Log is a blog that posts content relating to language and linguistics, including things like malapropisms and portmanteaus. While an informal source, it has produced new linguistic terms before, such as eggcorn. Its comments sections frequently contain discussions and arguments about English, whose participants are probably the same people who write Wikipedia articles about linguistic phenomena like malamanteaux. The fact that no modern citation could be found outside of Language Log comments implies that the malamanteau is not a widely recognized or studied concept, but one invented by amateur linguists. Malamanteau did not appear on Language Log until after this strip. Malamanteau has since been referenced on the Language Log website, with a link to the comic in question. Language Log has referenced XKCD many times before, reposting the comics and linking to the XKCD website.  The citation of a document from the 1490s is a reference to the fact that linguists, like those who post on Language Log, often use old documents as evidence, possibly to prove that a construction is a longstanding feature of the language. However, if such an archaic citation is the only evidence of the term's use, then it is unlikely to be a notable feature worthy of a Wikipedia article.  Further, the title text implies that the fictional article isn't exactly the most stable inside the fictional Wikipedia's userbase, or otherwise is being subject to some severe favoritism, since ""malamanteau"" hasn't been used at any time since the feudal ages and its most recent citations are a borderline flame war on another website. Most articles that are only cited by a single website tend to get deleted unless the subject has achieved significant coverage in outside news media.","[The strip is set up as the top of a Wikipedia page.] [The Wikipedia logo.] Wikipedia The free encyclopedia [Side navigation options.] Navigation -Main Page -Contents -Featured Content -Current Events [Wikipedia header options.] Article  Discussion  Edit this page  History [The article itself.] Malamanteau From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A malamanteau is a neologism for a portmanteau created by incorrectly combining a malapropism with a neologism.

She continues to make it clear that this is to make the students in general a little less wrong, and the main outcome will be that the guest of any future parties the students ever attend, will not have to listen to them retell these misconceptions and for that these guest will thank those who have decided on this new law in advance.  In the caption below the comic Randall expresses his wishes that he lived in a parallel universe where this rule had been used for many years. So he would not have to listen to all these stories at every party he goes to. Since Randall likes to correct people if they are wrong (see 386: Duty Calls), not having to discuss with those that believe these misconceptions, would make his parties much better.  The title text refers to a specific one of these false stories about glass:   In reality, older manufacturing processes did not produce glass panes with as uniform thickness as modern processes, and people tended to install the uneven panes with the thicker side at the bottom for stability. Glass simply does not flow at room temperature; it's more viscous than solid lead by a factor of over a billion. The fact that glass is solid at room temperature was again referenced in a foot note, under the pipe with glass, in 1649: Pipelines.  It seems that Miss Lenhart has taken the right course from 803: Airfoil as she there thought another common misconception.","[Miss Lenhart the teacher is standing in front of a board, looking at a laptop computer she is holding in one hand while elocuting.] Miss Lenhart: Okay, middle school students, it's the first Tuesday in February. Miss Lenhart: This means that by law and custom, we must spend the morning reading through the Wikipedia article List of Common Misconceptions, so you can spend the rest of your lives being a little less wrong. Miss Lenhart: The guests at every party you'll ever attend thank us in advance.  [Caption below the panel:] I wish I lived in this universe."
899: Number Line,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/899:_Number_Line,wikipedia,"The Wikipedia page List of Numbers opens with ""This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.""","Once again, Randall seems to be just messing around, this time with a number line.  The title text is a literalism joke, implying that Wikipedia would like its ""List of numbers"" page to include every number from negative infinity to infinity. It could also be a reference to Gödel's incompleteness theorems, which Randall has used as comic fodder before in 468: Fetishes. Gödel's theorems roughly assert that a number theory could never be fully complete. The equivalent for a list of numbers is Cantor's diagonal argument, which is a proof that any list of real numbers can never be complete even if the list is infinitely long. Either way, any ""true"" Wikipedia article named ""List of numbers"" would perforce forever be incomplete, no matter how much it was expanded. Both Gödel's incompleteness theorems and Cantor's diagonal argument feature prominently in Gödel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter, to whom Randall devoted later comic 917: Hofstadter. It may also be referencing his previous statements about Wikipedia being the home of compulsive list-makers, who make the most astonishingly complete lists imaginable.","[Number line ranging from -1 to 10.] [Arrow pointing left, towards negative numbers] Negative ""imitator"" numbers (do not use) [Line right before the number one] 0.99...

The title, ""Extended Mind"", refers to a theory proposed by philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers, which postulates that the mind not only includes what can be found in the skull, but also incorporates external things, like Wikipedia.  The title text refers to an observed phenomenon that many of Wikipedia's page links eventually lead to the Philosophy page. This may be due to the fact that the first few links in any article tend to reference more general or abstract ideas, which eventually gravitate towards philosophy. This is not actually true, though. It works for the spark plug page and countless others but not for all. The comment section below has some examples, but many of them are not working anymore, because Wikipedia references change in time.","[An IM window is open over a Chrome window with tabs for Spark Plug, Feeler Gauge, and Wikipedia.] Message with Mike1979 Mike1979: I replaced my spark plugs and now my car is running weird.

906: Advertising Discovery,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/906:_Advertising_Discovery,wikipedia,"When advertisers figure this out, our only weapon will be blue sharpies and ""[disputed]"".","On Wikipedia, a well-referenced text or statement indicates credibility. References for particular facts are linked to by bracketed blue little numbers in superscript.[1][3][4] When faced with a statement followed by these, readers will normally believe it without further ado,[6][10] since they take it on trust that there are directions on the bottom of the page, leading to a reliable source or two, agreeing with what the statement says. The effect becomes strengthened when such information often is confirmed to be correct.  In the comic, advertisers have realized that it has gone so far that people in general will take any nonsense for granted if there is just the right amount of Wikipedia-style reference tags to it. The penis pump e-commerce can suddenly flourish (again?) and the spammers won't even need to bother making up findings to cite.  Turgidax® is something Randall formed from turgid, meaning swollen. One reason that the attaching of -ax creates a typically pill-like name is simply that -ax (and -ex) are common Latin adjectival word endings, and that many drugs have names formed from Latin words. -Ax is also, specifically, the root of the -acious ending in English, as in ""audacious"" or (appropriately) bodacious, meaning ""extra"" or ""especially"". The idea is it makes the genitalius extra or especially turgid. Cardiovascular means relating to the heart and blood vessels.   The title text is about how Wikipedia users have been able to add ""disputed""-tags (nowadays ""disputed – discuss"") after challenged facts, with this template, since the dawn of time.[11][disputed – discuss] So when faced with the new advertising trick IRL, we could counter by scribbling those tags all over with blue Sharpie marker pens, and so automatically revive the critical thinking.","Advertising discovery: [Person sits at computer, reading an ad on the screen.

911: Magic School Bus,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/911:_Magic_School_Bus,wikipedia,"At my OLD school, we used Microsoft Encarta 2005.","The Magic School Bus is a series of educational children's books in the US that was adapted in the mid-nineties into an animated television show. The series centers on a class of children whose teacher Ms. Frizzle makes use of the titular magic school bus to take her students on a variety of magical field trips that allow them to experience various scientific topics first hand, such as the inner anatomy of the human body, the effects of friction, what goes on inside a beehive, and many others.  In this comic, however, Ms. Frizzle initially takes the students onto the bus apparently for one of these field trips to explore the way batteries work, but then for whatever reason, she has the students get off the bus again and simply resorts to looking up the Wikipedia article about batteries. The implied joke is that, with the advent on resources like Wikipedia, it's no longer necessary for Ms. Frizzle to take the students on half-hour long trips in the bus to experience whatever phenomenon they are studying that day (which is what the third panel symbolizes) - Wikipedia effectively answers the question quickly and easily. An alternative answer is that Ms. Frizzle has just gotten lazy, and has resorted to looking up the answers to the students' questions on Wikipedia instead of taking them on field trips. The alternative seems more likely, since the third panel shows them still going on an adventure, however briefly it takes to get to the library/computer lab.  The red and white cubed rocket in the bottom of the third panel can possibly be a reference to The Adventures of Tintin, in which Tintin goes to the moon in a rocket that is similar, if not identical, to the one depicted.  The child who is asking the question looks similar to Wanda, one of the regular students in the class who often asked the questions that set the field trips in motion. Ralphie, the student in the second panel with the backward hat, was another student who often asked these questions. The students in the class were shown to be from many backgrounds (i.e. some of the students were black, another was Asian, etc.), something Randall appears not to have added into this comic, despite it being in color.  The title text is a reference to Phoebe, one of the students in Ms. Frizzle's class, who would regularly make a remark beginning with ""At my old school..."" (Phoebe used to go to a different school, unlike many of the other students in the class) to express wonder at how unusual were the events of Ms. Frizzle's field trips (e.g. ""At my old school, we never rode on bees!""). Phoebe actually said that so much that in an episode where she goes back to her old school, the sign out front labels it as ""Phoebe's old school"".  Microsoft Encarta 2005 was a digital encyclopedia that was often used in school settings for learning with the aid of computers. Arguably, with the advent of Wikipedia, programs like Encarta have become relatively less widely used, which is part of the joke in the title text.","[A girl sits at a desk in a classroom, and the teacher stands before her. The teacher has a blue dress and blonde hair piled on her head in a bun.

915: Connoisseur,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/915:_Connoisseur,wikipedia,"Our brains have just one scale, and we resize our experiences to fit.","White Hat is fond of good wine, and he can probably distinguish slight differences in different types of wine, perhaps being the type that attends wine tasting parties. He doesn't like the cheap wine that Cueball has served for him (implying a cheap wine cannot be a good one, a statement most wine enthusiasts passionately agree with), looking with disgust at the label of the offending bottle.   On the other hand, Cueball doesn't have a preference; all of them taste the same for him, so presumably he gets the cheaper ones. White Hat tells Cueball that if he just tried some really good wine and paid more attention he would discover a whole new world.  Cueball's answer is the main message of the comic. He says that wine is no different from anything else in this respect, and makes a list starting with the wine but then going past house music, fonts, ants, Wikipedia signatures ending up with Canadian surrealist porn (Comic 1051 reference). His point is that if you spend enough time focusing one special type of subjects/taste/visual challenges, then you'll become a snobby connoisseur of that topic.   White Hat tries to defend wine by saying that some things have more depth than others (wine being among them), but Cueball challenges him on this by choosing something as obscure as 500 pictures of Joe Biden, the famously gaffe prone Vice President of the United States alongside Barack Obama, eating a sandwich as an example. He claims that if people are locked up in a box with those pictures for a year, they would end up being connoisseur on that subject with the same vehemence regarding the best picture as wine tasters can be about the best wine.  White Hat claims that this is an exaggeration, but Cueball takes this as a challenge so in the last panel, apparently White Hat and Cueball are actually running this experiment to see if they will end up concentrating on slight differences among the placement of mayonnaise on the pictures of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, just in the same way that White Hat concentrates on slight differences among kinds of wine. The result of the experiment is clearly going to Cueball's side, the discussion mainly going on the importance of mayo or the light through lettuce from the sandwiches.  This mentality may also be applied to online groups based on certain subjects (such as television shows, films, and other hobbies and interests), where arguments and vehement, stubborn opinions are common despite the fairly unimportant subject.   The title text presents the same idea in a different wording. The ""scale of our brains"" refers to a concept similar to Richard Dawkins' Middle World, where things too small (say, smaller than the point of a pin) or too big (bigger than what we can see from a mountaintop) are just out of our comprehension, so the things our brains understand must be neither too small nor too big, i.e. the ""middle world"".  However, the title text goes further in this idea: When we find things too big (like the distance to the Moon), we shrink it so that it fits into the ""middle world"" we're used to. Conversely, when we find things too small (say, a mote of dust), we expand it for the same reason. In a quite similar way, if all we have is pictures of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, we ""resize"" that subject so that we can fill books with the details about the pictures.  Specialized interests and the people involved in them are used again, with ants being the subject of 1610: Fire Ants,  typefaces in 590: Papyrus and 736: Cemetery, plastic straws in 1095: Crazy Straws and porn-video quality in 598: Porn.  In 1534: Beer, Cueball also argue slight differences in alcohol brands don't make much difference (in 915 ""Wine all tastes the same to me.""; in 1534, ""maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?"") and people just pretend due to social pressure.","[White Hat is holding a wine glass down in one hand and holding a bottle of wine up in front of him with the other hand. He is looking at the label and talking with Cueball standing next to him with his own filled wine glass in one hand. He is looking down at the glass.] White Hat: How do you stand this cheap wine? Cueball: Wine all tastes the same to me.  [Close-up of White Hat.] White Hat: You've just never had good wine. If you paid more attention, you'd realize there's a whole world here.  [Close-up on Cueball, who spreads his arms out, resulting in the wine in the glass sloshing so much that part of the wine is above the rim of the glass, some even hanging over the edge and a spray droplet hanging above the sloshing liquid.] Cueball: But that's true of anything! Wine, house music, fonts, ants, Wikipedia signatures, Canadian surrealist porn— Cueball: Spend enough time with any of them and you'll become a snobby connoisseur.

White Hat now has both glass and bottle held down at his side. Cueball holds his glass down, but tilted away from him.

Cueball: If you locked people in a box for a year with 500 still frames of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, by the end they'd be adamant that some were great and some were terrible. White Hat: You're exaggerating. Cueball: Oh, really?  [This panel is below the feet of the two characters from the previous panel. It goes further to the left than those two, and is wider than the previous panels, but it does not go much past the middle, so there is a blank white space to the left of this panel, below the first and most of the second panel. It shows a box, with two star burst on the surface from where two voices emanate from the inside. Over the top left of the panels frame is a small frame with a caption:] A year later: Voice (from left side of the box): Sure, most closed-mouth frames are boring, but in #415, the way the man's jaw frames the mayo on his hand is pure perfection, and— Voice (from right side of the box): What a surprise- you praising a mayo frame. Listening to you, I'd think there was nothing else in The Sandwich.  Voice (from right side of the box): Frankly, the light hitting J.B.'s collar through the lettuce would put #242 in my top ten even if he had no mayo on his hand at all."
978: Citogenesis,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/978:_Citogenesis,wikipedia,"I just read a pop-science book by a respected author. One chapter, and much of the thesis, was based around wildly inaccurate data which traced back to... Wikipedia. To encourage people to be on their toes, I'm not going to say what book or author.","This comic is calling into question the reliability of Wikipedia. This is a favorite pastime of librarians and professional researchers, and not usually one of Randall's. But, to take it seriously for a moment: People, Wikipedia is editable by anyone. If you are doing serious work, follow through the citations, and decide which are from upstanding sources, and which are just people writing on their blog, and which are people writing on their blog who know what they are talking about.  The title of the comic is a play on the word cytogenesis. Cytogenesis is the formation of cells and their development. Citogenesis, on the other hand is a portmanteau of 'Citation' and 'Genesis'. A Citation is a reference to a source, used to back up a specific claim. Genesis means the origin of something.  By extension, citogenesis is the creation of text in a reliable source that can be cited to back-up a claim.  The comic is discussing citogenesis occurring on Wikipedia, a free and freely editable encyclopedia that aims to become a comprehensive, neutral compilation of verifiable, established facts.  Wikipedia aims to provide only facts backed by reliable sources. However, this comic strip details a process in which Wikipedia can not only spread misinformation, but make said misinformation seem reliable through a process of ""circular reporting"".  In this distorted process, someone adds an untrue claim to an article in Wikipedia. A writer of some supposedly ""reliable source"" checks Wikipedia for information, and blindly relies on it, without checking for proper sources. Eventually, someone notices the claim in the reliable source, and cites it in the Wikipedia article. The citation then lends further credence to the claim in Wikipedia, so the claim is more likely to be used by other reliable sources, generating a positive-feedback loop.  Four years before, Randall commented on Wikipedia about that process happening to him (on a minor detail), which probably indicates the inception of this comic:  In turn, Randall originated the untrue assertion in this comic that Steven Chu, a physicist, and at the time of the strip the U.S. Secretary of Energy, invented the Scroll lock key, a common button on computer keyboards. Since most people are aware of the scroll lock key but know little about its function or origins, this false information would make for an interesting piece of trivia that would likely spread very quickly.      Following this comic, the actual Scroll lock and Steven Chu articles were both vandalized by ""helpful"" editors trying to project Randall's reality on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia article on Citogenesis redirects to the information loop section on the article ""Reliability of Wikipedia"".  That section ends with crediting the term ""citogenesis"" to ""webcomic artist Randall Munroe"", with a link to this comic. This now has three citations. To make matters even more surreal, some Wikipedia editor once flagged the link to this xkcd comic as ""Dubious - The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or non-factual.""!  We haven't seen a book like the one Randall describes in the title text.  But one example of the misuse of Wikipedia by ""reliable sources"" concerns the former German minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. His complete name contains fifteen names/words and reads: Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg. An anonymous user added one more (""Wilhelm"") to the German Wikipedia, just the evening before Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was presented as the new Federal Minister of Economics and Technology on February 10, 2009. The next day many major German newspapers published this wrong name (translation of bildblog.de).","Where Citations Come From: Citogenesis Step #1 Through a convoluted process, a user's brain generates facts. These are typed into Wikipedia. [A guy with short hair sits at a desk, typing on a laptop.] Guy: (typing) The ""scroll lock"" key was was designed by future Energy Secretary Steven Chu in a college project.  A rushed writer checks Wikipedia for a summary of their subject. [Ponytail sits at a desk, typing on a desktop.] Ponytail: (typing) US Energy Secretary Steven Chu, (Nobel Prizewinner and creator of the ubiquitous ""scroll lock"" key) testified before Congress today... Step #2  Surprised readers check Wikipedia, see the claim, and flag it for review. A passing editor finds the piece and adds it as a citation. [Cueball sits on a couch with a laptop in his lap, typing.] Cueball: Google is your friend, people. (typing) <ref>{{cite web|url= Step #3  Step #4 Now that other writers have a real source, they repeat the fact. [A flow chart, with ""Wikipedia citation"" in the center. The word ""Wikipedia"" is in black, the word ""citations"" is white with a red background. A black arrow leads from ""brain"" to ""Wikipedia."" A black arrow labeled ""words"" leads from ""Wikipedia"" to ""careless writers,"" and a red arrow labeled ""citations"" leads back to ""Wikipedia citations."" A black & red arrow leads from ""Wikipedia"" to ""cited facts"" which leads to ""slightly more careful writers,"" which leads to ""more citations,"" which leads back to :""Wikipedia"" (all black & red arrows).] References proliferate, completing the citogenesis process."
980: Money,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/980:_Money,wikipedia,"There, I showed you it.","This is another chart comic - a type of comic that Randall does from time to time. He has for instance done maps of the Internet (twice!) and other huge visualizations like this chart Radiation with a similar structure as this chart but with Radiation as the subject. The Radiation chart is most likely the inspiration for this much more comprehensive Money chart. In the chart there are five boxes with items on different scales of monetary value. Each scale of dollar increments are different colors. One dollar increments are green - naturally, because American paper money is green. Thousands are Orange/Red. Millions are gray. Billions are yellow. Trillions are blue. This comic uses the short scale for naming large numbers (so a billion = 1000 millions = 109 rather than a million millions = 1012 as in continental Europe). Because the comic is so huge and complex the explanation has been split into several parts and also individual pages: Below are five tables with explanation for some of the items. The transcript is (as is usually the case with huge comics) only given for the text that is visible on the picture shown here above. However the full transcript for all the text in the huge image has also been completed. Finally some tables with prices has been made (although they are not yet complete). In the Billions box there is a vague term called the ""Economic Vortex"" as well as arrows that flow between different blocks of this box. This is to show where the money goes. Where it is collected from, and where it is distributed to. Included in one frame is a small man with a red and white striped shirt, blue pants, a cane and a knit cap.

Extensions are small programs that install into your Internet browser and change the Web pages as you view them. Some make pages easier to read, some remove ads (the third extension is AdBlock) and so on.   For the joke in this comic, an extension accidentally replaces the word ""keyboard"" with ""leopard"" in a regex (or regular expression). In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means to ""match"" (specify and recognize) patterns in text, such as particular characters or words. The command to substitute/replace a string is ""s"", e.g. ""s/old/new/"" replaces any occurrence of ""old"" with ""new"". The title therefore contains the command to change ""keyboard"" into ""leopard"".  It's not clear what the extension Randall installed was actually supposed to do, but most extensions that revolve around text replacement are humorous in nature (such as Cloud to Butt, which replaces all instances of ""the cloud"" with ""my butt"").  The title text references the common IT phrase ""Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair"" or PEBKAC, which means that the problem is caused by the user, not by any failure of the computer.

In the case of Wikipedia and other wikis powered by MediaWiki, they are blue for non-visited and purple for visited. In this comic, Randall is ashamed of the pages he has visited, because with the color changes there is evidence of what he has visited in the past, e.g. autoerotic asphyxiation (possibly while researching 682: Force, which features that  very Wikipedia page).  Also the pages that he did visit before are in great contrast with the pages that he hasn't. Pages he didn't click are often difficult, highly intelligent topics, while he only clicks the easy, funny articles with little scientific background on the Wikipedia site.  The title text refers to a common mistake many people make when reading articles on Wikipedia. Words referring to subjects that have an article on Wikipedia are coloured in blue. This, however, can cause confusion when two words leading to two separate articles appear together, as the two links appear to be one. However, on hovering the cursor over the article link, only one word at a time is underlined, showing that the links are separate.  It is not possible to determine who this fake article is supposed to be about, but the Macarena band is certainly from Dos Hermanas, Spain. So, it is quite possibly a made up article from Randall.  If I go for a while without clearing my browser history, I start getting embarrassd by which words on Wikipedia show up in purple.","[the following is in the standard format of a Wikipedia article, modified to reflect the content of the comic.] ...and was a pioneer of literary social realism.

1079: United Shapes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1079:_United_Shapes,wikipedia,That eggplant is in something of a flaccid state.,"In this comic, each state of the United States of America has been filled-in with an object of similar shape. Due to the size range of the states, some states are too small to clearly make-out in the normal size image. Click here to see the large version, which makes every state perfectly clear. Several years later Randall made a new map of the US mainland 1653: United States Map, where he shuffled the positions of the states but filled out the outline. Also in this map Michigan has been split into two separate parts. (Here it is the glove and the eagle).   Very few, if any, of the shapes used are stereotypes of the state; they are merely objects that look like the state. Some of the objects are those which the states are widely known to resemble. For example, Michigan is represented by a glove and an Eagle, and a pot with handle takes the place of Oklahoma (with the panhandle region of the state filled with a literal handle). Others, however, are more creative. Few would have likely pictured Texas as a dog or Alaska as a bear with a jet pack and laser gun. There are several incredibly simple objects filling some states. Kentucky is filled by a cloud, which conceivably could have been used for any state, and Wyoming, one of the nearly rectangular states, is simply an envelope. There are three pairs of states that are related. Georgia and Missouri each contain an image of the other, drawing attention to their similar shapes, North and South Dakota are the top and bottom halves of an amp, and Alabama and Mississippi are moai facing in opposite directions.)  Colorado contains what looks like a Wikipedia article. A close-up of the fake article is provided [1]. The following references are made in the Colorado article:  New Mexico according to Randall's transcript is ""A liquid container labeled for something of unusual and silly danger"". The labeling is upside down and it refers to the nuclear testing facility White Sands Missile Range located in New Mexico for the nuclear bomb.  The title text makes fun of Florida which is sometimes called ""The penis of America"". Obviously, this penis is somewhat flaccid (not erect). The use of the word ""state"" is a pun, as it means some particular condition (flaccid state) as well as a political entity (The State of Florida).",The United Shapes A map of things states are shaped like  [Each state has some item wedged to stay inside its borders]
1081: Argument Victory,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1081:_Argument_Victory,wikipedia,"Really, the comforting side in most conspiracy theory arguments is the one claiming that anyone who's in power has any plan at all.","Cueball is arguing  with a conspiracy theorist, who is sitting in front of his computer talking back. They are probably using Skype, FaceTime, or another video calling service, as Cueball later asks  him to watch closely, holding his phone up to show the other guy what he is doing.   Cueball's opponent seems to ignore all reliable sources, like Snopes and Wikipedia on top of several journals, instead preferring sources that are seemingly not credible (but that do agree with him). These conspiracy "".net"" pages typically just have a black background and uses several different sizes of fonts, the larger (and probably also in bright colors), the more convincing, seems to be the belief, and Cueball cannot take these kind of sources seriously. "".net"" websites can be made by anyone and have little limitations. The maker of a "".net"" does not need to show sources of information, or even their name. As such, "".net"" websites are notoriously unreliable and often have viruses or other malware. The Truth about Black Helicopters is an example of one such website, supposedly explaining the truth behind government ""Black Helicopters"".  The conspiracy theorist insists that by trusting reliable sources, Cueball is simply buying in to the cover-up. Cueball says he can win the argument, and will show him how, and then ceases to argue further in favor of going down a waterslide while holding up the phone to show the other guy how to have a good time. Since conspiracy theorists tend to be intransigent, Cueball sees himself as the victor after ceasing to argue with a guy who cannot be argued with, and instead decides to have some fun. This is even improved by the fact that it makes his opponent angry.   The joke here is also in the title of the comic which is Argument Victory something that is very hard to achieve by on the web... Cueball won this victory not by arguing but by stopping this argument he was having with someone that could/would not be argued with.  The title text points out that belief in a conspiracy presupposes that those with the power to carry out the conspiracy actually have a plan, a situation which might be found more ""comforting"" than the alternative that those in power are just muddling through with no plan at all. This concept is revisited in 1274: Open Letter.","[Cueball, looking right, is talking at his smartphone while holding it up in front of his head using both hands.] Cueball: I can't believe you're so wrong.

1087: Cirith Ungol,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1087:_Cirith_Ungol,wikipedia,"My all-time favorite example of syntactic ambiguity comes from Wikipedia: 'Charlotte's Web is a children's novel by American author E. B. White, about a pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by an intelligent spider named Charlotte.'","This comic is a mash-up between the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the novel Charlotte's Web.  The title Cirith Ungol is a reference to Lord of the Rings where Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were led to Cirith Ungol by Gollum and to the lair of the ancient spider Shelob.  And therefore in this comic, Frodo (by himself) is being led into the lair of the spider, Charlotte. We can tell by the ""Some Pig"" writing in the spider web on the lower right hand corner which is a direct reference to the story of Charlotte's Web, in which a spider named Charlotte writes the very same text in her web.  The title text refers to syntactic ambiguity which is a property of sentences which may be reasonably interpreted in more than one way, or reasonably interpreted to mean more than one thing. This allows us to derive two different meanings from the same sentence.   The second part of the title text is a quote from Wikipedia, which Randall enjoys for its  syntactic ambiguity, as it can be logically interpreted in either of the following ways:  This quote was modified the same day the comic appeared [1]. It could be found on Wikiquote until 27 April 2016.  A similar ambiguity explicitly discussed in the title text of 1004: Batman.","[A character in a long flowing robe holds up the Phial of Galadriel in one hand; the One Ring is dangling from a necklace in the other.

1167: Star Trek into Darkness,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1167:_Star_Trek_into_Darkness,wikipedia,"Of course, factions immediately sprang up in favor of '~*~sTaR tReK iNtO dArKnEsS~*~', 'xX_StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNess_Xx', and 'Star Trek lnto Darkness' (that's a lowercase 'L').","The talk page of a Wikipedia article is used to discuss changes to the article. An edit war is a dispute about a specific edit to an article, manifesting as a series of edits alternating between making and reverting the change, and usually accompanied by a more-or-less heated debate on the talk page.  Here, Randall is referring to a dispute on the Wikipedia article about Star Trek lnto Darkness (an upcoming Star Trek film at the time of the comic's posting). On the day before the comic was published, the article name had a lowercase ""into"", and the talk page looked like this (rounded off in a friendly way, with the posting of a summary of the arguments, and an exchange of virtual hugs). In summary, the debate centers around whether ""Into Darkness"" should be treated as a prepositional phrase or an unpunctuated subtitle (as in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness""), whether compound prepositions like ""into"" should be capitalized in titles, and whether the capitalization of the title in the movie's official promotional material is relevant. The intensity and multiple facets of a debate over one tiny letter is apparently entertaining to Randall.  Cueball changes the title so that every other letter is capitalized, and adds framing tildes and asterisks (a common, but childish and ugly way of emphasizing titles online). This will probably not go over well.  Megan's line of ""They should have sent a poet."" is a quote from the film Contact. The quote is also featured in 482: Height.  In the movie, the line was meant to convey that only a poet could adequately capture the beauty seen; here, it indicates that prose is insufficient to capture the ironic beauty of the edit war.  The title text indicates Randall's belief that such arguments are perpetual and will always arise. He suggests that the edit to the Wikipedia page will result in a dispute over variants of Cueballs ""compromise"". Because the lowercase ""L"" and the capital ""I"" appear similar in many fonts, he also puts forth the potential argument that the character in the movie's title is a lowercase ""L"".  The old ""favorite edit war"" might be the one referenced in the title text of 878: Model Rail or the one resulting from the addition of the 739: Malamanteau article to Wikipedia  After the publication of the comic, the debate continued with full force, complete with a section of xkcd-inspired suggestions. The article itself was soon protected, so that only administrators could edit it. A day later, the title was changed to one including a capital ""Into"" by the administrator Mackensen. (The debate continued on his talk page.) Currently https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/~*~_StAr_TrEk_InTo_DaRkNeSs_~*~ is a valid link and it redirects to the correct page, but this redirect was nominated for deletion and kept in 2015.  The Independent published an article about the ""grammatical tizzy"", and the affair as a whole was added to Wikipedia's humorous list of the lamest edit wars.","[Cueball staring at computer screen.] Cueball: Oh, wow. Look at Wikipedia's Talk page for Star Trek into Darkness. I have a new favorite edit war. Megan (off-panel): Oh?

Megan: They should have sent a poet.  Cueball: Well, I'm making an executive decision. I hope both sides accept this as a fair compromise.

1193: Externalities,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1193:_Externalities,wikipedia,Mouse over words and things to see where they come from.,"This comic isn't a static image - even the title text changes depending on which part of the image you're hovering over. It presented a competition for students to see who could come closest to break a Skein hash but also an aid appeal for the Wikimedia Foundation.  There are quite a few references in the comic to Baidu. Baidu is a large Chinese Internet services company that employs thousands, whose shares are publicly traded on world stock exchanges. It's the predominant Internet search provider of China, and is sometimes called the ""Google of China"". It offers parallels for the Chinese market of many of the services that Google provides and offers its own encyclopedic wiki with a restricted edit policy to serve as a replacement for Wikipedia. Wikipedia reports that Baidu's search engine handled 56% of Chinese internet search queries in Q4 2010. and that in October 2012, Baidu ranked 5th overall in the Alexa Internet rankings. Given that explanation for the Baidu references in #1193 is still solicited for explainxkcd, Baidu apparently is not well known yet among savvy XKCD readers. Baidu Search results reputedly follow the censorship dictates of the Chinese authorities, causing it to return censored responses to searches for politically sensitive terms like ""Tianamen Square massacre"" or ""Falun Gong"" when executed by web browsers that are connected via Chinese ISPs. When you execute such searches via Baidu in the US, the top links returned for these topics do seem to reflect Chinese government sensibilities although the uncensored English language Wikipedia articles for these topics are listed high in the query results. Baidu's reputation for censorship provides background for Megan's reply ""but nothing about Tianamen Square"" in response to the ""Come and find your future at Baidu"" employment enticement of panel one and also provides the background to understand the ""It takes great minds to stifle other great minds"" slogan of the second panel.   The blank regions in the above image are dynamically generated from various sources.  For the two days until comic 1194 appeared, a competition was underway to see who could come closest to breaking a Skein hash.  The first text line of the first panel contains a link to http://almamater.xkcd.com. This page contained the text:  On this page, users were invited to enter ""Your school's domain name"" — presumably intended to be their college alma mater. (At least in the beginning, only a few top-level domains were accepted.) If the user entered an acceptable domain (by xkcd's rules, which apparently changed during the 48 hours of the competition), he could then enter data values one at a time. For each data value entered, xkcd returned a hash value and the number of bits by which it differed from the target value. The object was to achieve the lowest possible number of differing bits, ideally zero.  A ranking page showed the lowest value achieved for each domain name entered, but not the data that achieved it. The first name on the list was substituted in various panels, and the third-place school showed in panel five. No data values were reported by xkcd, but various results were posted by users of the xkcd forums and on other websites, leading to copycat submissions, so that occasionally large numbers of institutions would show the same moderately low value.  After the end of the contest, the data submission page vanished, replaced by the final list of rankings, which shows that Carnegie Mellon University achieved the best score with 384 bits incorrect out of 1024.  The rankings only show a few hundred out of the several thousand domains submitted—presumably Randall chose to chop the copycat submissions off the end of the list, retaining only honestly obtained results.  In some cases, Megan's reply seems to correspond to the company.  The text in the second panel is based on the company in the first panel:  The text in the form varies independently of the text at the top, sometimes related to the organization in 3rd place:  The title text documents the different sources of data in the comic. The different title texts are:","[This was a dynamic image where the text changed during April 1st.

I wanted to include the pitch drop experiment, but it turns out the gif format has some issues with decade-long loops.","This comic shows a number of common events, arranged in a grid. Each of the events flashes with its average frequency.   For example, statistically a child is born somewhere on the world approximately every 0.24 seconds, or four times per second.

At room temperature, tar pitch flows at a very slow rate, taking several years to form a single drop. The title text jokes that Randall tried to include a tile that flashes about once every ten years, but the tiles are all animated GIFs and while the file format supports animations of any length, the resulting file would be too big (at least 10 megabytes).

It is a list of Wikipedia article titles that are in the same syllable-stress pattern as the first line of the theme song of the 1987 cartoon series.  The list is compiled in alphabetical order from top to bottom, without respect to the left or right column. Some of the items on this list (e.g. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) are drawn as headlines in the same style as the logo from that series. These articles are not in alphabetical order with the surrounding small face text, but these headlines are in alphabetical order with the other headlines from top to bottom, without respect to the left or right column. Some of these phrases are not actually the titles of Wikipedia articles, but are redirects. For instance, the article on Woodrow Wilson ""Woody"" Guthrie redirects to Woody Guthrie, and Former Arctic Monkeys members redirects to Andy Nicholson.  The syllable-stress pattern of this line is long-short-long-short-long-short-long-short, known in poetry as trochaic tetrameter. Randall has previously authored comics dealing with trochees, namely 856: Trochee Fixation and 1383: Magic Words.  A similar idea was performed by Jimmy Fallon in 2001 at a concert for New York city where he demonstrated singing ""any 80's song"" over the tune of MC Hammer's song ""U Can't Touch This"".  The title text suggests an album of songs (The Purple People Eater, the aforementioned Ninja Turtles theme, Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini and the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers theme), the title or primary refrain of which have a large number of verses in trochaic meter. Randall suggests that these refrains are so interchangeable that the lyrics of each could be sung to the melody of the song following it in the tracklist. Randall would title the album Linked List as each song would melodically reference the next song.

It is a portmanteau of the words brother, meaning a close male friend (aka ""bro""), and romance.  Although current in popular media, some commentators have criticized the implicit homophobia in the term, suggesting that it denotes cultural discomfort at relationships of emotional closeness between men. [1]  In this comic, Randall is implying the Wikipedia page for the word ""bromance"" should more accurately represent what most bromances actually are: friendships. This could be a joke to reference the fact that some males prefer to not call friendships as such, for fear of looking unmasculine, or being confused as a gay couple. The comic makes light of the fact that the word bromance and friendship are interchangeable, and should be treated as such.  The comic later contains parts of the edited article, mocking the use of ""bromance"" in popular culture, implying that ""friendships"" can be used just as easily to describe platonic male relationships.  Despite supposedly vandalizing the ""bromance"" article, the article is titled ""friendship"", giving a similar result to word-replacement browser extensions, as in 1031: s/keyboard/leopard/. It is also possible, however, that a {{DISPLAYTITLE:Friendship}} tag was added to the article's source code to cause the page's name to display as such.  The title text implies Randall does not agree with Wikipedia vandalism, except in the case of bromance/friendship, and also militia/fanclub, possibly to make light of the harsh sounding word in a negative light.  In the wake of this comic, several Wikipedia pages were vandalized, among them Bromance, Militia organizations in the United States, Militia (United States), and Friendship. All these pages were semi-protected by an administrator against further attempts for a week after this comic was published.  The day this comic was published, a vote to delete the Bromance article was initiated on Wikipedia.[2]  A later comic called 1746: Making Friends, was also not so much about friendship, but rather about vultures...","[A Wikipedia style layout is shown for extracts from an article titled Friendship.]  Friendship From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A Friendship is a close non-romantic relationship between two (or more) men, a form of affectional or homosocial intimacy.[1]  Contents [Hide] 1 Etymology 2 Characteristics 3 Portrayal of friendship 3.1 Celebrity and fictional friendships 3.2 Historical and political friendships 3.3 Gay-straight friendships  4 See also 5 References Etymology Friendship is a portmanteau of the words friend and ship.

Items near the top-left corner (such as the meaning of You're So Vain) are mysterious but not really strange. Items near the bottom-right corner (such as the Dyatlov Pass incident) have a clear explanation but are quite strange.   The title text refers to the mystery of Randall staying up late to read Wikipedia articles, when he was already supposed to be asleep an hour ago. This is apparently not very unusual for him (see for instance 214: The Problem with Wikipedia). And this mystery actually has an obvious explanation: Following up on an idea that eventually led to today's cartoon.  Some of these mysteries have already been explored in xkcd. See 950: Mystery Solved where Randall ""solves"" Amelia Earhart, Lost Roanoke Colony, Jimmy Hoffa; 593: Voynich Manuscript; and 1400: D.B. Cooper.  Note that Randall uses similar diagrams in both 388: Fuck Grapefruit and 1242: Scary Names which also contain different items. Both of these also have an extra point mentioned in the title text, but these points are in the title text because they are far off the chart, whereas in this comic it's the description of the point that is too long to fit on the chart.

1521: Sword in the Stone,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1521:_Sword_in_the_Stone,wikipedia,That seems like an awful lot of hassle when all I wanted was a cool sword.,"In this comic, Megan pulls a sword out of a stone. A flash of light comes down and music plays, and a heavenly voice tells her she has ascended to the throne of England. Megan then pulls out her phone and searches on Wikipedia for England . After having read for a while she begins, while reading on, to replace the sword into the rock.  The comic references the fables of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. In Arthurian legend, whoever can remove The Sword in the Stone is the lawful king of Britain (although this comic, like some versions of the legend, refers only to England). Arthur is an orphan being raised in secret; he notices the sword, removes it, and is proclaimed king. The sword is sometimes identified as Excalibur, although in other versions Excalibur was acquired by King Arthur from the Lady of the Lake. The most familiar version of this story is The Sword in the Stone by T. H. White which is based on Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory. The animated musical by Walt Disney is a well known version of this fairytale based on White's book.  A key element in the joke is that as Megan begins to read about England, especially information concerning being an English ruler, she quickly thinks better of this and begins to put the sword back in its place. The punchline that Megan puts the sword back after reading about England suggests that the ""gift"" of being the leader of England is not worth the risk and/or work associated. British history is rife with monarchic strife, and a brief inquiry into their causes of death will show that almost one in three British rulers have died either in battle or from murder, etc. This would quickly lead most sane people to conclude that the risks associated with ruling England far outweigh the benefits.  The title text furthers this plot, having Megan comment on the hassle when the only thing she was interested in was the cool sword. Apparently Megan is not enthusiastic about power, and her choice is made when she sees how problematic it could be to reign over the country of England. There is also a subtle play on the fact that in the T. H. White version, Arthur likewise is unaware of the significance of pulling the sword from the stone; he is simply looking for a sword to replace the one belonging to his step-brother Kay that was stolen under his watch, to avoid embarrassment and reproach.  From the time of the Roman Empire all the way up to Charles II's reclamation of the throne, the area now known as England has seen several migration waves, Viking raids, invasions and fierce power struggles among aristocratic families. Besides the constant threat of usurpation, as evidenced by the numerous wars for the crown, such as the Norman conquest and the War of the Roses, there were also constant difficulties in managing the frontier regions. This can be seen from Hadrian's Wall, a creation of the titular Roman Emperor designed to keep the ever difficult Scots out of the areas of Roman control (the Scots would be a constant problem for England up until the reign of King James VI and I; think of the movie Braveheart for a good example of the regular headaches they caused, seen from the English point of view), as well as the Welsh uprisings that occurred with such consistency that you could set your watch by them.  It is worth emphasizing that the term ""England"" is anachronistic in this context. At the time Arthur supposedly existed, there was no England — England was formed by Germanic tribes who settled in Britain between the fifth and seventh centuries. In many of the stories, including the earliest, Arthur was in fact was depicted as a leader of the native Romano-Britons in their attempts to repel these invaders. England would not exist had Arthur succeeded. The anachronism is not new; it entered Arthurian legend in the Middle Ages. (Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, for example, refers to Arthur as King of England.) In Arthurian legend it was stated that Arthur would return when needed (in some versions he was explicitly associated with the Mab Darogan, a Welsh Messianic figure who would finally drive the English out of Britain and reclaim it for the native Britons).  It is possible that Megan in this comic is a 21st-century reincarnation of Arthur.  The timing of this comic might relate to the birth of princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana on May 2, 2015 just four days before this comic, and the burden of a royal of having a whole life in public shaking hands of strangers. Since 2013 the line of succession was changed to absolute primogeniture, meaning that she will keep her current position in the line (4th after her older brother) even if she later gets baby brothers. Before this year, that would not have been the case, as the male gender took rank over birth order.  It is also probably not a coincidence that this comic was published the day before the UK General Election, occurring on May 7, 2015. This election decides the modern-day leader of the UK. And the problems they face today, may even be more likely to cause Megan to give away the throne, than the risk of untimely death she would have faced in Arthur's days.  A similar Wikipedia gag appears in 911: Magic School Bus.",[Megan walks up to a sword in a stone.]  [Megan attempts to pull the sword out of the stone.]  [A beam of light and music plays as she removes the sword.]  [While standing with the swords a voice from the sky speaks in gray shaky letters:] Celestial voice: The Throne of England is yours  [Megan takes out her smart phone and searches:] Wikipedia England  [Megan reads on her phone.]  [Megan starts to replace the sword back into the stone.]
1551: Pluto,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1551:_Pluto,wikipedia,"After decades of increasingly confused arguing, Pluto is reclassified as a ""dwarf Pluto.""","This comic was posted on Tuesday, July 14, 2015, in honor of the New Horizons deep space probe making its flyby at Pluto, thus breaking the typical Monday/Wednesday/Friday cycle for the xkcd comics. Also on this day he released the first what if? in over three months, and it was called New Horizons. Luckily it did not end up back on Earth, as depicted in 1532: New Horizons, released 1½ month before closest approach.  Randall has taken one of the probes images of Pluto, and outlined humorous examples of pareidolia on top of it.  It can be compared to preliminary descriptions by geologists, e.g. New Horizons' best look at Pluto before close approach|The Planetary Society.  The comic probably winks at Percival Lowell whose observatory photographed Pluto in 1915 ""known"" as Planet X. Unfortunately Percival Lowell is most famous for are his drawings of the Canals on Mars which are widely misunderstood as channels based on wrong translations from Italian to other languages.  The title text refers to the debate as to whether Pluto should be classified as a full or dwarf planet. This debate was particularly brought into the public eye, and came to be seen as a matter of controversy, following the 2006 IAU definition of planet. The text may imagine that this debate winds on, with definitions being created and revised until a ridiculous state is reached whereby Pluto has a special class of celestial body named after it called a 'Pluto', but fails to fulfill the arbitrary criteria set up for it, and hence is called a 'dwarf Pluto'.  There actually exist the terms Plutoid and Plutino, that relate directly to groups that Pluto belongs to, but see those pages for details of their use and usage.  Suggests Pluto is a confection, like Minmus. May also be a reference to the Mars candy bar.  The JPEG image format has the common issue of slightly distorting an image with Compression artifacts. The artifacts shown here do not appear in the official version of this image, but all data sent from New Horizons is compressed and artifacts are common — the full resolution images will be submitted to earth over the next 16 months. There have been tweets about people seeing plumes associated with active volcanoes and the like, which were explained as being artifacts.  Interpreting Pluto as a head, the frontal bone could be the light-colored region next to the darker top, just above the north pole facing to us.    The area above Pluto's north pole is attributed to grease.  Could refer to possible extraterrestrial life on Pluto in the form of insects, or ""bugs"". In the animated TV series Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles, an adaptation of Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers, the first battles with the alien ""Bugs"" took place on Pluto. Maybe it also refers to a software bug at the probe.  A string of small round features which Randall suggests were the result of Pluto getting shot repeatedly, probably by meteorites.  Reference to the what if?, Drain the Oceans: Part II, about draining the Earth's oceans onto Mars. In the previous what if?, Drain the Oceans, the Netherlands took over the Earth once their problem with the risk of flooding disappeared. And then they continued to issued forth from the portal that drained the oceans on Earth pouring them onto Mars, to claim Mars as New Netherlands. Presumably something similar happened on Pluto. This was already again references in both an entry in the table and in the title text of 1555: Exoplanet Names 2.  Since the base photograph is identified as ""today's New Horizons image,"" this indicates that a section of Pluto has immediately become the subject of some controversy, possibly a territorial claim or one of several references to the fact that Pluto was demoted from full planet status in 2006.  A generic map hazard.  Pareidolia is the human brain's tendency to see patterns where they don't exist. While probably a reference to Pluto's heart, the joke is also recursive: You'd be seeing the text of a Wikipedia article explaining to you that you couldn't actually be seeing the text of a Wikipedia article.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  The Kuiper belt is a region in our solar system that contains an unknown amount of icy bodies, one known is Pluto. Randall jokingly refers to Kuiper Belt as the same kind of belt that's used to fasten clothing, and identifies features on Pluto's surface as loops for the belt.  An outline of the Firefly-class spaceship Serenity, which was the titular vessel from the 2002 TV series Firefly. One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  Nobody can see a dinosaur unless Randall did do this painting on Pluto's surface. And a complex comic needs at least one dinosaur.  A section of Pluto that is objectively better than the rest.  This could be interpreted as a moon growing/emerging out of pluto, as a bud is ""a compact knob-like growth"". A round growth is seen at the location marked, resembling a small, emerging moon.  A reference to the classic video game Pacman, wherein the primary antagonists are one of four Ghosts. The Ghost on Pluto appears to have a mouth, however, unlike most depictions of the Pacman Ghosts. One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined.  Suggests Pluto had dinosaurs and lost them the same way Earth did.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined, and the only one (currently) also informally named as such by NASA.  Also known as ischemic heart disease, which causes degradation of heart tissue.  The region identified in the comic looks less 'healthy' (is darker and more ragged) compared to the rest of the 'Heart', which Randall suggests is caused by the disease.  Referring to the general practice of naming extraterrestrial mountains ""X Mons"" (e.g. Olympus Mons, a mountain on Mars and the largest mountain in the Solar System), as well as naming terrestrial mountains ""Mount X"". Since ""mons"" is Latin for ""mountain"", the feature's suggested name translates as ""Mount Mountain"".  A terrain feature suitable for connecting an outside source of electricity for the benefit of implied internal batteries. Compare ""dock connector,"" below.  Implying that Pluto is some manner of giant egg. Possibly a reference to the Doctor Who episode Kill the Moon, in which the Moon is revealed to be an egg from which a monster is hatching. A 2014 article from The Onion, ""Moon Finally Hatches,"" makes the same joke. Also possibly a reference to The Light Fantastic, a Discworld novel in which similar objects are revealed to be the eggs of the world turtle. A similar idea appeared in Jack Williamson's 1934 short story ""Born of the Sun"".  Balls often have a ""plug"" or opening to insert a needle to inflate or deflate them.  Since it's all-caps, we can't tell if ""PREDATOR"" is a proper noun, but this is possibly a reference to the movie series Predator, about a race of aliens who hunt other beings for sport. Alternatively, a planetary predator (such as comic book villain Galactus) may have previously scarred Pluto.  The structure indicated is a small black dot (at least at this distance this picture was taken). Reset buttons on home electronics are often small buttons or holes used to reset the software of the electronic device.  One of a number of pareidolic features Randall has outlined, this one in the shape of a popular video game protagonist.  Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet rather than a planet following the latter term's controversial redefinition in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.  Arguments about the classification continue to pop up. The same argument is referenced in the title text. The name implies a proposal to put all the people still arguing about it in this hole on Pluto. This proposal further implies that the continued debate is very annoying by 2015, except perhaps to the debaters themselves.  The area indicated is near the terminator and shows some intriguing topographic relief.   A neoplasm or tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue. Randall is suggesting that the abnormal region near the heart has been evaluated by a doctor and determined to be benign.  Suggests the discrepancy in color over Pluto's surface may be a function of what cake frosting was used where. This area is the ""dark spot"" at the head of the ""whale"" (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/14/science/space/pluto-flyby.html).  The so-called ""whale's tail"" (http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/find-heart-whale-new-horizons-picture-pluto-n388816), is on the other hemisphere and is not visible in this image, it lies east about 90 degrees from the chocolate frosting/dark spot here.  As above, suggests the discrepancy in color over Pluto's surface may be a function of what cake frosting was used where.  A reference to the Disney animated feature The Lion King. In the movie, the Pridelands is the bright and prosperous region ruled by the Lion King while a dark territory beyond its border is controlled by hyenas.  A continuation of the Lion King reference above.  From the point of view of the photograph, this feature of Pluto is at the planet's ""bottom,"" where iPod dock connectors are.

1665: City Talk Pages,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1665:_City_Talk_Pages,wikipedia,I don't think the Lakeshore Air Crash Museum really belongs under 'Tourist Attractions.' It's not a museum--it's just an area near the Lake Festival Laser Show where a lot of planes have crashed,"The comic makes fun of Wikipedia talk pages. On Wikipedia, every article has a place to discuss the content of the page, called a talk page"". In this case, the comic talks about the talk page of an article about a city. While some of the topics are quite normal for such a page (e.g. the quality of the images) others are not (e.g. too many murders and mine disasters in the city). The topics discussed suggest that the city has many problems and is a bad place to live in or visit.  The topics show a common problem at Wikipedia's talk pages: People often use them as a place to talk about the subject of the article, but it is for talking about the article itself. Someone at the top of the talk page is suggesting a better name for the city.  The article repeatedly refers to ""the murders"", suggesting that the city might be well-known for them. It seems that the editors cannot agree on how notable ""the murders"" are. ""Not that notable"" refers to Wikipedia's general criteria for including information in articles. Material which is not noteworthy should be removed; however, different editors often disagree about what is notable, resulting in conflicting edits as text is inserted and then removed (an ""edit war""). Someone replies that ""all cities have murders"". While true, many cities in low-crime countries would not have a series of them so well-known that when someone talks about ""the murders"" any reader could be expected to know what they are talking about, making this sound like an attempt to make the city sound nicer than it is. ""I think the murderer is reverting my edits"" suggests the murders are being committed by one person who is influencing how they are shown on Wikipedia - perhaps trying to prevent Wikipedia from publishing evidence of them or possibly publicise them by adding more information about them. This raises the possibility that the discussion of the murder visible in the infobox picture may have been initiated by the murderer.  The infobox is a short fact sheet that many articles in the (English) Wikipedia have; it generally includes an image illustrating the subject of the article. The question of which picture is best for the infobox (because this image is so prominent) can cause edit wars. It emerges that the photograph of the city has a murder in it. Instead of forwarding the picture to law enforcement, someone uses the image editing software Photoshop to erase the murder so the picture will be less objectionable. It appears that murders are so common in the city that any random photograph of the city has a chance of showing a murder, to the point where a second photo proposed as a replacement for the infobox picture is found to show another murder.  Voltaire was a French Enlightenment writer. As a prominent and very opinionated intellectual, he gets a lot of quotes falsely attributed to him; most famously, he did not actually say ""I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"" (that was Evelyn Beatrice Hall).  It seems that the people who are editing the article are getting desperate to find a non-bleak picture of the city. When a non-bleak picture is added, it turns out to be from the 2016 Disney film Zootopia. The fictional city which is the setting and title of the film has a distinctive look which is far from bleak, but is not a picture of the city. (Zootopia is called Zootropolis in many European countries for trademark reasons.)  The city apparently is a mining city and there have been some mining disasters. An editor is complaining that this section is too long, but another editor points out that this is because there have been so many mining disasters that a large section is needed to cover the topic.   1982 Secession refers to Key West, Florida seceding from the United States in 1982 to form the Conch Republic.  A known problem on Wikipedia is ""coatracking"", where people use articles to promote topics that are not strictly the subject of the article (perhaps by writing far more about them than is necessary, when they could just be mentioned in passing). Here, it emerges that the article on a city expresses a dubious opinion on condom use. This is against several Wikipedia policies: it would be irrelevant to the article and sounds like an editor's attempt to publicise their views.  Andrew Lloyd Webber is an English composer famous for writing The Phantom Of The Opera. Webber is also known for writing the music for Starlight Express, a rock opera about anthropomorphized trains, which is probably another factor in the train station joke. Meanwhile, Frank Lloyd Wright, who shares his middle name and last initial, was an American architect, who designed more than 1,000 structures. As it turns out it was the composer who was responsible for the train station, and as a result the station roof has collapsed.  It is complained that the article is promoting the ""Lake Festival Laser Show"" too much. In the alt text, it emerges that the laser show is so impressive that it has caused a number of aeroplanes to crash. This probably refers to the fact that laser pointers should not be aimed at aircrafts, as they can be distracting to the pilots. The article has been promoting this area of crashed planes as the ""Lakeshore Air Crash Museum"", despite it not having any educational purpose.","[Caption above the panel: ] I love reading the Wikipedia talk pages for articles on individual cites  [A list of contents for a Wikipedia talk page regarding an article about a city.

1690: Time-Tracking Software,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1690:_Time-Tracking_Software,wikipedia,"List of helicopter prison escapes' and 'List of sexually active popes' are both entertainingly long, but sadly there's no 'List of helicopter prison escapes involving sexually active popes.'","In this comic, Randall uses time-tracking software, which is intended to increase productivity by identifying how you are spending time, that reveals that he is doing frivolous and pointless things that take up large amounts of his time. He makes remixes, edits Star Wars footage, reads strange (albeit entertaining) Wikipedia articles (see 214: The Problem with Wikipedia), and even spends a large amount of time adjusting this software, all without getting anything useful done. Thus, he is embarrassed at this revelation. This time waste is a common subject on xkcd, as shown for instance in the comic mentioned above.  The visual appearance of lightsabers in the Star Wars movies of the original trilogy has been digitally changed twice during the re-releases for the 2004 DVD and 2011 Blu-ray releases. There are several Star Wars fans that feel the need to alter the movies (mainly to revert the changes made in the re-release), but so far nobody felt the need to replace lightsabers with metal swords.  Jack & Diane is a rock song written in 1982 by John Mellencamp. ""Suckin' on a chili dog outside the tastee freeze"" is the first line of the second verse of the song (see the lyrics here). A remix made using just this line would probably sound a bit repetitive (listen for instance to this re-mix of Don't You Want Me, that almost only uses the first line of the song).  Two Wikipedia lists are mentioned in the comic and title text; List of helicopter prison escapes and List of sexually active popes. Given that the Pope is supposed to be celibate (at least after 1139), the mere fact that more than ten popes have been involved in sexual activity, even after 1139, is both amusing and intriguing. There are more than forty entries in the helicopter escape list for real-life attempts (plus 16 in fiction); not all of them succeeded, but several did!  This xkcd comic was published on June 6th. On that day, the Wikipedia article ""List of helicopter prison escapes involving sexually active popes"" was created and subsequently deleted.  On June 7th, the Wikipedia Facebook page posted a link to the List of helicopter prison escapes article. A user commented asking if the article was posted on Facebook due to the xkcd comic, and Wikipedia replied by pasting an image of the xkcd comic, which seems to indicate that the Wikipedia representative running the Facebook page was aware of this xkcd comic and posted the list in reference to the comic.  In the title text, Randall mentions his disappointment with the lack of a Wikipedia list stemming from the intersection of the two; that is, a helicopter prison escape involving a sexually active pope. With the last sexually active pope being Pope Leo XII in the 1820s, and helicopter predecessors only taking flight in 1907, and mass production of helicopters not occurring until the 1950s, such an event has probably never happened.  The Wikipedia list of sexually active popes has been mentioned before in the what if? Into the Blue on infinitely powerful lasers, and after noting that such a thing cannot exist, the list is offered as a replacement for entertainment.  The comic 1692: Man Page was released later that week and also mentioned the pope.","[This comic shows a pie chart with 5 slices, each with a label and a line pointing to these five different sized slices.

1757: November 2016,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1757:_November_2016,wikipedia,"Once you've done this, make a note of how old they were. Then, when their age reaches double that, show them this chart again.","This is yet another comic designed to make you feel old, following soon after the last one 1745: Record Scratch. Not so long ago a comic with the very title of the largest bold letters in the caption above the panel was released: 1686: Feel Old. The next comic about feeling old, was released 11 months later, with a similar title, which is special in it self, 1898: October 2017 see more on both title and this follow up comic in the trivia section below.  Specifically this comic contains The November 2016 Guide to making people feel old. (The  unusual title for the comic indicates that it only works during this month). It lists ages between 16 and 41 and links each age to one or more events that happened approximately half that age ago, so 8 years ago for the 16 years old and 20 years ago for the 40 years old etc, which means that a person of that age would have had the mentioned thing in their life for the majority of their life. And then it explains that to make a person of a given [age] feel old, look up the [thing] (or things) connected to it, and say:      As an example the age 21 can be used, as it list both the Xbox 360 as well as this comic, xkcd itself. The two possible sentences would then be:  This matches earlier attempts to make people feel old by mentioning how long ago it was that, for instance, a movie comes out as was the case in 891: Movie Ages. (But on this exact day when the comic was released there might have many people who did already feel old an tired - see trivia). When an event seems to have occurred recently to you, like seeing a movie when you were twenty (with Toy Story) and then suddenly realizing that this was 21 years ago, you will very likely feel old. Since humans' perception of time is not related to how much time has actually passed but rather to important memories, then memories like seeing the first feature-length fully computer-animated movie (Toy Story) makes a big impression and may stay vivid in peoples' memories. When they then, after hearing the sentence from this comic, realize that more than half their life has passed since that event, they realize how much time has passed and that makes them feel old.  This is why it affects a 20-year-old to hear that Twitter is ten years old, where this will not have the same impact on a 16-year-old, since they were so young when it came out that they probably feel like it has been around for ever, and you do not feel old by hearing, for instance, something like that the TV was invented before you were born. It thus makes sense to pick something that happened almost midway through a person's life, because they then realize they are now double as old as when they first heard of Twitter. Of course also many ten years old would not have been active on Twitter when it was released, so it may not have that big an impact on those 20 years old today.  Actually many of the chosen things are something that Randall specifically has interest in and several of the chosen events or movies relates to things that are recurring subjects in xkcd, as can be seen by the long list of categories that belongs to this comic. And while movie series like Star Wars, The Matrix, X-Men, Shrek and Toy Story are probably well known to most of xkcd readers as are games like The Sims and Pokémon, books like Harry Potter and comics like Calvin and Hobbes, then there are other things that are either only known to xkcd readers, basically not to anyone or at least not to people who where only 8-12 years old when the thing occurred. And if the person was not even aware of the specific thing existing, or at least not aware of it at the time when it was new, then the impact of saying the sentence to them will be little to none. Basically the first three ages, 16-18 years, would fall into this category. At 8 years old you are not supposed to play any version of Grand Theft Auto (not that some might not do it), and Rickrolling is also mainly for young adults, not 8-9 years old children. Worst of all is the reference for age 18 to the, probably mostly unknown, movie Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, which is directed at adults, and thus definitely not at those children that where 9 years old when it was released.    Nintendo Wii for people at 10 years old is the first that might make an impact, as will Xbox 360, but then again not xkcd, which is not directed at 10-11 years old children. But, the entire comic is mainly made to make readers of xkcd feel old by letting them know how long all these items are. But for the big movies and events that most people know about, it might also work on people not interested in xkcd. See more regarding if the sentence would work or not in the table below.  The joke at the end is that people over 41 don't need anything to make them feel old, because they already feel old. He thus teases people above 41 years old by claiming they are old, although many people (above 40) would claim you are not old before you retire. This trick was also used to cap the above mentioned 891: Movie Ages to 35 years old, stating anyone as older was already old. But that comic was also released five years ago, and now Randall is himself closing in on 35 at 32 years at the time of this comics release. So he pushed the limit 6 years further, probably for this reason. Now he no longer thinks people at 36 are too old to try to make them feel old.  It may be a coincidence, but still interesting, that he stopped the list just before 42, a number Randall has referred to many times in relation to it being the ""Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"" in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  For something to have existed for the majority of someones life, it is supposed to be older than half the persons age, but it seems Randall went for just about half the age. For instance for a 35-year-old person (born 1981), it lists the release of the movie The Matrix, which was released March 31, 1999 making it very close to 17.5 years ago, fitting with half of 35 years. For the 41-year-old it is slightly more than half of their life that has included the movie Toy Story, which was released almost exactly 21 years before this comic in November 1995, compared to the 20.5 years from half of 41 years. The only entry on the list that seems to veer more than half a year from the half age is  the one for autotuned hit songs which seems to refer to 1998, maybe specifically starting with Cher's song Believe released on October 19, 1998, making it 18 years ago. But it is listed together with the age 33 years, which should thus have been connected with something around 16.5 years old (16-17 years). However, this entry is also one of the less time specific. However, the rule still applies, it's just the only one where it is such a big majority of the persons age (18 years in their life 15 years not in their life). See more in the table below.  The title text points out that the same chart can be used for the same person once they are twice as old. So it urges the user to note down the age of the person it was used on, and then wait until their age reaches double that. So for a 16-year-old that would only be 16 more years until they are 32, but for a 41-year-old it would have to wait until they are 82 years old. When showing them this chart, they will realize that this has existed for half of their life and again have the same type of ""feeling old"" that this comic is supposed to instigate today.(It will work better if they still remember the joke made on them those many years ago)...","[Caption above the panel:] The November 2016 Guide to making people feel old  [A chart with a list of items to be put into the two first lines above the chart.

1900: Jet Lag,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1900:_Jet_Lag,wikipedia,"I had some important research to do on proposed interstellar space missions, basketball statistics, canceled skyscrapers, and every article linked from ""Women in warfare and the military in the 19th century.""","Hairy has just woken up at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and Ponytail mentions he must be still jet lagged (possibly from a recent trip). Hairy then accidentally public confesses that he has actually been up to some late-night Wikipedia browsing and reading about maritime disasters.  In the caption Randall confesses that he loves traveling, because he can then use jet lag as a nice excuse for what is actually his usual messed up sleep cycle.  In the title text, Randall states that he had to do some important research. But what he lists, are clearly also just topics he read in Wikipedia: proposed interstellar space missions, basketball statistics, canceled skyscrapers, and every article linked from ""Women in warfare and the military in the 19th century."" Randall has earlier illustrated this issue in 214: The Problem with Wikipedia.  Randall has previously discussed his oft-changing sleep cycle in 320: 28-Hour Day and 448: Good Morning, and has alluded to it more subtly in 68: Five Thirty, 92: Sunrise, and 776: Still No Sleep. We can thus see that this is a habit of Randall's that has persisted for more than a decade, as has his obsession with Wikipedia.","[Hairy, with more messed up hair than usual, is rubbing his eyes while small ""sleepy"" bubbles form over his head, while walking towards Ponytail.] Hairy: Sorry, I just woke up. Ponytail: It's 3 PM! ...Oh, of course, you're still jet lagged. Hairy: I-yeah, that's it! I definitely didn't spend half the night reading Wikipedia articles about random maritime disasters.

202: YouTube,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/202:_YouTube,youtube,I pray GunPistolMan never learns the word 'sheeple'.,"This comic is pointing out the fact that many of the comments on YouTube videos are insipid and poorly informed, being pointless arguments over some minor topic or factually incorrect position. In this case, the Moon landing hoaxers are at the receiving end of Randall's pen.  This comic was published in December 2006. In July 2009, a restored video showing Neil Armstrong's first moonwalk was uploaded to YouTube. User Michael Huang copied to that video's comments section all the sentences in this comic. Then, after some other users took some of his comments seriously, he later added another comment stating, ""This entire comment chain is from the famous webcomic, xkcd."" The comments are copied verbatim, including typos and grammar errors. The only mistake is in the first comment: Michael Huang included only one question mark when the comic has three of them.  The title text is the first reference to Sheeple, which appeared a few more times in xkcd comics. The reputation of YouTube comment threads as cesspools of abject stupidity and blatant trolling is revisited in 301: Limerick and 481: Listen to Yourself. The username CrackMonkey74 appears again in 406: Venting and 574: Swine Flu.","The Internet has always had loud dumb people, but I've never seen anything quite as bad as the people who comment on YouTube videos.

462: Freemanic Paracusia,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/462:_Freemanic_Paracusia,youtube,It's amazing what it does for YouTube comments.,"Paracusia is a form of hallucination that involves perceiving sounds without auditory stimulus.  Morgan Freeman is an American actor who may be best known as the character Red in The Shawshank Redemption, where he is also the narrator. He narrates because he is especially known for his soothing and mellow voice, which helps him amplify performances in minor parts, such as God in Bruce Almighty. He has been a narrator of many TV programs and also narrated the major film War of the Worlds where he did not play any other part.  The comic is a play on the combination of the two. The idea is that while reading a text, instead of hearing you own voice in your mind's ear, you substitute it for Freeman's voice, giving a new perspective on the contents of the text. Here, the voice of Morgan Freeman converts the most annoying possible thing on the web (penis enlargement advertisements) into a soothing meditation.  The title text suggests to apply this specifically on the mostly stupid comments on YouTube, like those found in 202: YouTube.","[Cueball is sitting behind a desk with a computer.] Freemanic Paracusia: A disorder wherein you hear everything you read in the comforting voice of Morgan Freeman. [There is a thought bubble of Cueball's thoughts, within it is Morgan Freeman reading text.] Morgan Freeman: Why, you could enlarge your penis for cheap. My, my. Isn't that something."
481: Listen to Yourself,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/481:_Listen_to_Yourself,youtube,"Man, I just wanted to know how babby was formed.","YouTube is a website for video sharing where anyone can upload and view videos. It is notorious for having some of the most ridiculous, hateful, mean-spirited, nonsensical comments of any mainstream website (a reputation touched upon earlier in 202: YouTube).  Danish tells Black Hat that her computer virus reads a YouTube user's comments back to them before it is submitted. Upon hearing their own ridiculous comments read aloud to them, they will realize the stupidity of it and not submit the comment. YouTube later made this a real feature, although it has since been removed again.  The title text is in reference to a post left on the Yahoo! Answers website in 2006 by a submitter known as ""kavya,"" who asks ""how is babby formed / how girl get pragnent."" The post picked up internet popularity and spawned several flash animations. This was again mentioned in 522: Google Trends and in 550: Density.","[Black Hat approaches Danish typing at a computer.] Black Hat: What are you writing? Danish: Virus. Black Hat: What's it do?

920: YouTube Parties,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/920:_YouTube_Parties,youtube,"This reminds me of that video where... no? How have you not seen that? Oh man, let me find it. No, it's ok, we can go back to your video later.","A YouTube party is when a group of people show each other YouTube videos. The problem with YouTube parties is that no one pays attention to the video that's playing; instead, each person is thinking of the video that they personally want to play next.  You can see analogous behavior at any get-together where couples (parents) are telling stories about their kids. Nobody cares about anybody else's kid; they are just waiting (not even listening) until they get the chance to talk about their own offspring.  The joke seems to be that everybody is doing this, but it is unclear whether they realize it. They each seem to be under the delusion that the others will be fascinated by ""their"" video (or child's accomplishments), even though the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. Possibly they don't care about that either; they just want an audience, even an unwilling one.  This may be defensible where kids are involved, because the parents could reasonably feel that the accomplishments of their children reflect well on themselves. However, the people in the YouTube party didn't create the videos, they just found them. Which makes their behavior (or perhaps YouTube parties in general) even more insane and pointless.  The title text reiterates this point. The speaker is reminded of another video that is so superior to the one currently playing that we should find it and watch it immediately. We can always go back to the current video later (if anybody still remembers, that is; and according to the comic above no one will want to remember it).","[Cueball and a group are standing in a dark room around a table. The group and Cueball are illuminated by a laptop on the table.] The problem with YouTube parties: Cueball (thinking): This video is blowing their MINDS.

1224: Council of 300,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1224:_Council_of_300,youtube,And hypnotize someone into thinking they've uploaded it and passed it around.' 'But then won't the uploader get suspicious that it pauses at 301+ for a while? Why don't we just forge the number entirel--' ::BLAM:: 'The Council of 299 is adjourned.',"YouTube (a video sharing site) used to have an odd quirk in its view counter. When a video hits 301 views, the view counter briefly stops updating. This means that YouTube is checking the views to make sure that no foul play is going on. The choice of the number 301 is due to a harmless off-by-one error; Numberphile produced a video that explains all this very well. At times the number 301 catches some YouTubers off guard — for very popular videos, it may appear that the video has more likes than views.  YouTube added a ""301+"" to indicate that the video has reached the 301 point and is awaiting review.  More recently, however, YouTube has abolished this[1].  The author plays with the near coincidence of this number, and a conspiracy theory entity known as the Committee of 300. In this case, the video's first 300 views come from each of the Committee's council members who determine if the video will go viral. The video is then released to the public by sending it to a regular person (Cueball in this comic) making the total number of views 301.  The title text elaborates on this by explaining that the council also hypnotizes somebody to make him think they uploaded and shared that particular video.  According to the title text, the council does not seem to tolerate contradiction, because the member that suggests changing 301 to a random number to avoid suspicion is shot and silenced permanently and removed from the council.","[A secret society meets in a darkened chamber; a kitschy video involving two people and an RC helicopter is projected onto the background.] Master: ...then it is settled. We the 300 members of the Secret Council, decree that this video meets our standards, and shall ""go viral"". Master: send it to one of our agents to be leaked to the common folk. Steward: Some of them are noticing the number. Master: ...add a plus sign to throw them off. Steward: very well. Soon...

1305: Undocumented Feature,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1305:_Undocumented_Feature,youtube,"And it doesn't pop up a box every time asking you to use your real name. In fact, there's no way to set your name at all. You just have to keep reminding people who you are.","An undocumented feature is a part of a software product that is not explained in the documentation for the product. Cueball has found such a feature, a chat room intended to ask for help, accessible through the help page of some unnamed old Windows utility. The people who found the chat room started out using it for its intended purpose (helping users of the utility by contacting other users), however as time has passed they have become friends and enter the chat only to talk to each other, with no relation to computer problems.  A virtual machine (or VM) is a computer program designed to emulate the hardware of a full computer. In this case, users of the old chat room create VMs only to have the old operating system installed which included the utility program. They use this setup only to access the old chat room. This is shown in the third panel where Cueball is using a modern laptop to enter the chatroom (presumably by means of a VM), whereas Ponytail is most likely using an old computer (as evidenced by the CRT monitor).  A chat room like this must be hosted on some outside server, so the narrator of the comic wonders who runs this server. An obvious thought about this is if and when the server will be shut down, effectively cutting all communication among chat users. Another obvious thought is why the utility author is still maintaining the chat server, since its original purpose of allowing communication between users with problems with the utility program is no longer an issue as everybody has migrated to more modern systems. The comic suggests that the reason for doing this can be a bored sysadmin, who is just reading the messages of the chat users and following their lives but never writing anything. This would turn the chat room into a soap opera for the sysadmin.  The Deep Web is a term used to refer to any information which is available online, but is hard to find (usually because there are no links to that information in web pages). The chat room described would be an example of this. From this point on, the comic takes an existentialist turn (a frequent xkcd trait), talking about how life is short, everything has to end, etc.  The last panel is a reference to Facebook's recent announcement that it would start autoplaying video ads, and the title text refers to YouTube requiring its users to use their real-life identities instead of just nicknames. These last parts of the comics somehow reveal that the point of the whole comic is just to complain about aggressive money-driven policies used by modern social networks in general and Facebook in particular. It is hinted that Randall would prefer older technologies, where limited resources would forbid autoplaying videos or huge databases with every detail of every user's life.  It's possible that the comic is about an actual chat room, but more likely it is a complete invention, since if it were real someone would have been able to trace its origin. However, if it is real, the participants would not want to confirm this in order to protect their privacy.  The title text mentions the simplicity of this chat; even user names do not exist and other users could only be identified by their behavior because the user names are random and can change on every login.  There are many examples of undocumented features in programs written for old versions of Windows, for example:","[A support window is shown.] An old Windows utility has an undocumented feature. If you open ""help"" and click on the background, you get dropped into a ""support"" chat room. Support Window: Launching support forum...  [An active conversation between two people is shown.] Only a few of us ever found it. But we became friends.  [Cueball and Ponytail are at computers.] We kept launching the program to check in. Eventually some of us were running VMs just to keep accessing it.  [Another conversation.] As the Internet aged, so did we.  [Three question marks.] We don't know who runs the server. We don't know why it's still working so many years later. Maybe we're some sysadmin's soap opera.

[The bubble is now smaller, and some parts of a web are shown.] A life's worth of chat,  [More of the web is shown.] Buried in the deep web.  [A flat landscape is shown with the sun at the horizon.] But even if it lasts forever, we won't. When we're gone, who will remember us?  [Cueball and Hairy are shown standing together in a bubble.] Who will remember this strange little world and the friendships we built here?  Nobody.  [An empty bubble is shown.] This place is irrelevant. Ephemeral. One day it will be forgotten.  [The bubble starts to fade away.] And so will we  [The bubble has almost completely faded away.]  [The bubble is now completely gone.]  But at least it doesn't have fucking video ads."
1804: Video Content,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1804:_Video_Content,youtube,"So, like, sexy news videos? ""No, people have tried that--it's still just video content. We need to actually inform people THROUGH making out. I would call it 'Mouth Content,' but I think that's already the title of a Neil Cicierega album.""","This comic is a commentary on the declining publishing industry and their unsuccessful attempts at regaining an audience.  News media has evolved dramatically as the world entered the information era.  Newspapers, which were at one point the most widely distributed and consumed form of media, have rapidly been eclipsed by new technologies such as television, Internet, and streaming video.  Subscriptions to paper-based media have been drastically declining to the point where many publishers are on the verge of shutting down.  While publishers are making an effort to move their content to newer, more popular forms of media, in many cases they are still clearly behind the times.  The comic illustrates one such example with Cueball suggesting presenting news stories as videos rather than text. This is presented and received by Megan, Hairbun and Hairy as a clever new idea that would appeal to young people based on the fact that they like watching YouTube videos. However, apparently no one in the comic has realized that television news programs have been filling such a niche for decades and that young people are just as uninterested. In fact, online video based news is often considered annoying, especially if autoplaying or if there is no text based alternative. In reality, this idea is not at all original and likely to be doomed to fail from the start.  As with many similar attempts, the new ""ideas"" that publishers are trying to adopt are merely cramming news content into things young people like, without really understanding why they like it and without considering whether news would be a good fit.  In the caption, Randall suggests it would be pointless to argue with newspaper publishers about their ideas.  Presumably Randall believes publishers who fall for those ideas are already out of touch with the new generation, and would not be able to understand why those ideas lack merit.  Instead, he suggests taking the trend to a ridiculous extreme, by telling publishers that young people like making out.  Suppose publishers follow the same pattern and try to cram news into this as well, they would end up creating some form of news program centered around making out.  The results may turn out completely laughable or highly entertaining.  If the former, it could serve as a wake-up call to publishers that they need to reconsider their approach.  If the latter, then it could actually become a trend and unexpectedly reinvigorate the industry.  In the title text it seems like the news agency actually consider this idea, or is at least confused enough to ask. Their interpretation of combining ""making out"" with news is to make it sexy, but the next speaker says that this has been tried before and doesn't work. This is likely a reference to Naked News [link potentially NSFW], a news program that does that: it features attractive women delivering the news while simultaneously disrobing. This concept has not, for some reason, spread to the mainstream.  According to the speaker, merely making the news sexy is not enough – the news content must be directly integrated into the making out; how this would be accomplished is as yet unclear.  The title text also dismisses the proposed name Mouth Content as possibly the title of a Neil Cicierega album, in reference to his recently-released Mouth Moods, as well as his prior albums Mouth Sounds and Mouth Silence.","[From left to right: Hairy, Cueball, Megan and Hairbun sit around a conference table.] Cueball: Research shows young people like YouTube, so we should present news stories as videos instead of text! Megan: Good idea! Hairbun: They'll love that!  [Caption below the panel:] Instead of arguing with newspapers about this, we should just tell them how much young people like making out and see what happens."
1836: Okeanos,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1836:_Okeanos,youtube,WHEN I WAS ON A BOAT I DROPPED MY PHONE CAN U LOOK FOR IT,"The NOAAS Okeanos Explorer, named after the Greek (and Roman) personification of the sea Okeanos, is a vessel that is currently exploring the Central Pacific Basin. It livestreams the video feed [1] of its deep sea exploration online.   This comic seems to be a representation of the livestream on YouTube [2]; see the table below for details.   The chat section for the actual livestream is disabled, but the comic adds some humorous examples of what the chat section would look like.  Several of the examples are the product of commenters falsely believing the livestream is that of a game, probably since most livestreams on YouTube are of people playing games; Randall is joking about the viewers of said streams in particular not being able to tell the difference, as well as YouTube commenters in general. Randall has mentioned the ridiculousness of comments on YouTube before in both 202: YouTube and 481: Listen to Yourself. One of the comments seems to refer to Minecraft, since one of the comments asks why nothing is being crafted (crafting is an action in Minecraft used to make items).  In the caption below Randall states that he likes to view the stream and commends them on disabling the chat section, for the reasons given in the comic above.  The title text is yet another comment by someone who dropped their phone in the ocean from a boat, and now wants to use Okeanos' resources to find it, which is of course impossible, as the phone will by now be hidden in the silt on the bottom. And even if not, the chance of finding anything dropped in the Pacific Ocean, the largest Ocean on the Earth, is all but zero. Also, the Central Pacific Basin, where Okeanos was at the time of this comic's release, is 6500 meters deep; at that depth the water pressure is approximately 4454.863 kilopascals, or roughly 646 PSI. This is probably enough to irrevocably damage something as breakable as a cell phone. Even if the phone were of the so-called ""waterproof"" variety, that rating is usually only applicable to a few meters of depth rather than thousands of meters.  Needless to say, retrieving one's phone from the bottom of the Central Pacific Basin would be a challenging and pointless endeavor.","[The comic takes place during a typical YouTube livestream. The livestream video titled ""Camera 1: Exploring the Central Pacific Basin"" is provided by the channel ""OceanExplorerGov"" and recorded from Okeanos Explorer exploratory vessel.

149: Sandwich,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/149:_Sandwich,linux,Proper User Policy apparently means Simon Says.,"On a UNIX computer system, users can be assigned to all kinds of rights, for example rights to access to certain directories and files to execute certain commands. The sudo command lets certain (authorized) users override these policies by executing the command (everything after the word ""sudo"" on the command line) as the root user. Root (sometimes called the superuser) has complete system powers, exempt from all access controls. One very common activity for UNIX administrators is to install or configure software using the UNIX make command, e.g. % make install.  Often this command requires administrative permissions in order to complete successfully, which in practice means the ""make this"" command will fail unless it is typed as ""sudo make this"" instead. Forgetting to start the command with ""sudo"" is a fairly common and frustrating mistake for people who administer UNIX systems or their personal Linux computer. They then need to repeat the command with ""sudo,"" whereupon the computer responds obediently, and everything works smoothly.  Cueball is demanding a sandwich from his friend. Not being properly asked, the friend denies the request. Cueball then (ab)uses the sudo command on the friend, who then has no choice but to go and make the sandwich, and now does so without complaint, because Cueball has all the rights. For anyone versed in installing system software with the make command, this exchange is intensely reminiscent of the analogous onscreen experience.  Simon Says is a children's game in which a leader gives various commands that must be followed if and only if (iff) the leader prefixes the command with ""Simon says."" The title text compares the way the computer will run some commands if they are preceded with ""sudo"" to the way Simon Says players are supposed to follow orders if (and only if) they are preceded with ""Simon says.""  Alternatively, the title text might merely be referring to the similarity between Cueball ordering his friend around with ""sudo"" to the Simon Says game leader ordering other players around. Wikipedia suggests  that the ""Simon"" in the name of the game may be the powerful lord Simon de Montfort, or a corruption of Cicero, both of whom were influential politicians of their day.","[Cueball is sitting on a couch, talking to a Cueball-like friend.] Cueball: Make me a sandwich. Friend: What? Make it yourself. Cueball: Sudo make me a sandwich. Friend: Okay."
178: Not Really Into Pokemon,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/178:_Not_Really_Into_Pokemon,linux,"As of this writing, Ubuntu 6.10 and Firefox 2.0 have left my computer a complete mess.","Pokémon is a popular franchise that includes 5 children's animated television shows, a collectible card game, and a whole series of video games. The premise is that a young ""trainer"" goes out to explore the world and catch Pokémon: fanciful wild creatures that come in many varieties, ranging from armoured dinosaurs that have drills for horns to robotic bugs that change their type depending on the items they are holding. When the trainer comes across wild Pokémon or other trainers, they use their Pokémon to fight each other.  In this comic, Randall claims that ""I'm not really into Pokémon"" can serve as an all-purpose phrase of condescending dismissal. The implied insult to the thing being dismissed can include:  The example in the comic is Black Hat dismissing Ubuntu, an open-source computer operating system. Ubuntu may have been particularly chosen as specifically suitable for the ""Pokémon dismissal"" for reasons such as:  The title text refers to the complications that new software releases can have on computers, especially if either the release is an alpha or beta release, or if the computer is rather old. Randall specifically mentions Ubuntu 6.10 and Firefox 2.0, both of which were officially released around two weeks after this comic was posted, so the versions causing problems were certainly pre-release editions. While Randall does not detail any specific issues, the title text may paint a picture of two computer programs fighting each other inside the computer and making a mess in the process, as if they were Pokémon.","I have found the perfect phrase for condescendingly dismissing anything: Cueball: Have you seen the new Ubuntu release? Black Hat: Nah, I'm not really into Pokémon."
196: Command Line Fu,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/196:_Command_Line_Fu,linux,"When designing an interface, imagine that your program is all that stands between the user and hot, sweaty, tangled-bedsheets-fingertips-digging-into-the-back sex.","The Linux command line allows a user to make their computer do nearly anything. The only hitch is that the interface is entirely text-based, and reading through user manuals to find the commands that you need can take a very long time.  In this comic, Cueball recounts how he used a command line hack to solve a problem with his monitors turning off during a movie. However, in the time that he spends trying to solve the issue, the woman he had brought home had already left, and his need for a movie to watch was gone.  The title text is the supposed moral to this story: if your user interface takes as long to operate as a command line, you may very well be denying your users the chance to get laid.  Software that jiggles the mouse actually exists, as well as instructions for linux scripting (although installing the necessary libraries might take a while).","[Two men talking.] Cueball: Last night I was watching videos with this girl and my monitors kept turning off - even though I had disabled power save. Friend: Odd. Cueball: However! I wrote a command to jiggle the mouse pointer every couple minutes to keep it from going idle. Friend: Not the first hack I'd try, but see? Linux has problems, but it gives you the tools to deal with them - and save your date! Cueball: Actually, I was half an hour into the pointer scripting documentation when she got dressed and left."
215: Letting Go,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/215:_Letting_Go,linux,At least I never gave her the root password.,"In fiction, a character who has had a romantic relationship end will be shown taking some act to remove a sign of their partner's presence in their life, e.g. removing/selling a wedding or engagement ring, removing the partner's toiletries from the bathroom, or deleting the partner's phone number from a cell phone. This is used to symbolize that the character has accepted the end of the relationship and is ready to move on, no longer pining for their loss or seeking to restore the relationship.  The first three panels imply that Cueball was presumably in a now-terminated relationship with Megan. The final panel shows him using the Unix command 'userdel' to delete her user account from his computer. The joke here is that he considers this to be a significant part of accepting that she is no longer a part of his life, where most people would consider it a routine administrative task.  The title text refers to Cueball's thankfulness that he never gave Megan the password to the administrator ('root') account on the computer. It is unclear why this is; he might be worried that she would have used the access to perform malicious actions after the breakup, or simply glad to be spared the need to change the root password. Alternately, it could be a metaphor for marriage and/or a closer emotional relationship, and he is glad that he did not allow her an even greater hold on his heart before the breakup (which would, of course, have entailed commensurately more pain when she did leave him). Not sharing the root password is indicative of a lack of trust in their relationship, which could be a factor in the initial breakdown.","[Cueball is holding a picture of himself and Megan in a heart; it has been ripped down the middle, separating the two people.]  [Cueball sits at computer, looking at the picture.]  [It is night.

272: Linux User at Best Buy,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/272:_Linux_User_at_Best_Buy,linux,We actually stand around the antivirus displays with the Mac users just waiting for someone to ask.,"Best Buy is an American chain of electronics and media stores. As with many such big box shops, they only sell pre-bundled software and boxed pre-built hardware, where the computers on offer are either Macs or other PCs, usually pre-installed with some variant of the Mac OS X or Windows NT operating system families. Most personal computer hackers/enthusiasts (as opposed merely to workaday computer users) wouldn't be caught dead buying a pre-made computer, preferring instead to build their own using self-selected hardware components and install and configure their own preferred operating systems and software. As such, the subtext is that somebody buying a complete pre-packaged home computer system at Best Buy wouldn't know or care much about computers.  The salesperson is trying to sell antivirus software to Cueball because selling such software (e.g. Norton or Kaspersky) to prospective Windows PC owners is generally a good sales tactic. The vast majority of all computer malware is engineered specifically to exploit Windows, and Windows' inherent anti-malware protection might most charitably be described with the phrase ""lacklustre, but not as bad as before."" Windows users therefore will want antivirus protection, especially for use on a brand new machine that will soon be connected up to the Internet. Moreover, because the ecosystem of viruses and malware that thrive by infecting Windows PCs is constantly evolving (see 350: Network) and being redesigned to take advantage of new exploits and fool last-month's antivirus software, it is quite prudent for a Windows PC owner to always keep their malware protection absolutely up-to-date, and many such security suites need to be regularly renewed with new versions.  While some viruses and malware can afflict Linux, in general UNIX and workalike operating systems of its type (e.g. BSD) are far more robust and secure than Windows, with fewer exploitable vulnerabilities; so, Cueball is confident (probably rightly so) that he will be fine without added security. Moreover, Linux is free software, so although malware protection usually isn't necessary for it, excepting for tasks requiring very high security standards (such as on servers and supercomputers), if extra protection is desired by the user, it is generally easily obtainable, often gratis.  Back in 2007, after the commercial failure that was Windows Vista and with a stagnant Mac market, many in the Linux community believed that Linux would soon wipe out Windows as the operating system of choice for desktop PCs, after years of slow-but-steady growth. This explains the cheeky triumphalism of the final panels of the comic, in which Cueball hops on his quick, slick vehicle and speeds away. It's worth noting that  The title text makes sense in light of the fact that, like Linux, the software design of OS X (both are based on Unix, OS X through Darwin - see 676: Abstraction) limits the amount of harm that can be done by malicious software, and Macs thus also have fewer viruses and malware than Windows. Apparently, Mac and Linux users flock together just waiting for some salesperson to come along and mistake them for someone gullible enough to use Windows. This is taking the piss out of the smugness sometimes to be found among Mac and Linux users, who may view their preferred systems as hip and different from the ""mainstream"" Microsoft systems that they feel are manifestly inferior.","Salesman: Interested in updating your antivirus software?

278: Black Hat Support,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/278:_Black_Hat_Support,linux,So as not to leave you hanging -- it was a problem with select() calls.,"This strip portrays Black Hat providing support for Linux, but in fact he provides only annoying and unhelpful advice just for his own personal amusement.  The support line is clearly for Linux, as stated in the introduction, and the client on the phone clearly has a Linux problem. However, Black Hat is intentionally giving irrelevant instructions that refer to the Windows OS (Start Menu, My Documents Folder).  Finally, Black Hat asks the client on the phone to ""bear with him"" and suggests that the client should use a highly obsolete mechanism to look for the answer to his problem, namely AOL keywords. AOL is well known for producing one of the earlier online communities and has since fallen largely out of favor. The client hangs up the phone.  The title text mentions the function select(), which allows you to write asynchronous IO access routines by checking if it is ready to be read/written to at a specific moment. This is different than a threaded model, in that it can happen in a single thread. The danger of such programming is that if you do not coordinate the reader/writer properly, you can create a deadlock, which can result in the consumption of a lot of resources.","[Black Hat is sitting at his computer, wearing a phone headset.] Black Hat: Thank you for calling the Black Hat Support Line, your first source for Linux support. How may I assist? Phone: Hi. I'm running an Apache server, and the load keeps climbing out of control. Black Hat: Okay. First, click on the Start Menu. Phone: I'm sorry, this is the Linux helpline, right? Black Hat: Of course, Sir. Black Hat: If you'll just open the ""My Documents"" folder- Phone: Just a damn minute, I think you're putting me on. Black Hat: Please bear with me, Sir. Black Hat: Now, load up your AOL and go to the Keyword ""Linux""- Phone: *click*"
340: Fight,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/340:_Fight,linux,And she put sweet nothings in all my .conf files. It'll take me forever to get X working again.,"The boot sector of a hard drive is where the information for operating systems is stored. It tells the computer to load a program; in most cases this is an operating system. If this sector is overwritten, an operating system stored on the drive can't be booted into.  The first two panels indicate that Megan is still mad at Cueball from a fight from the night before and the third panel shows promise of her forgiving him through an overly affectionate love note. However, the last panel reveals that she used the love note to overwrite the boot sector of Cueball's computer out of anger.  The .conf files of Linux- and Unix-based systems are text based files where all the settings for various applications are stored. Since all the configurations were replaced with ""sweet nothings"" - whispered lovers' talk, or literal nothings (blank space or meaningless jumbles of characters) - none of the programs work as they should. X is the X Window System, the most common GUI framework used on modern Linux and Unix systems. Once upon a time it was notoriously hard to configure correctly, even when starting from a known good configuration, let alone a destroyed one.  (More recent versions of X configure themselves correctly for most users without a .conf file.)","We had a fight last night.

416: Zealous Autoconfig,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/416:_Zealous_Autoconfig,linux,I hear this is an option in the latest Ubuntu release.,"Cueball is seen in an attempt to connect his laptop to a Wi-Fi network using, as the comic title suggests, a particularly zealous ""Wifi Autoconfig"" utility — ""zealous"" being a synonym for ""eager"" or ""enthusiastic"". The utility manages to find a secure access point named ""Lenhart Family"", presumably Miss Lenhart's home Wi-Fi access point, and attempts to connect to it.  Instead of requesting a password, the program automatically begins a dictionary attack, entering in various commonly-used passwords in the hopes that Miss Lenhart has little regard for proper security measures (a flaw shared by many computer users). When this fails, the program attempts to exploit a WEP vulnerability, which surprises Cueball. This also fails, possibly because Miss Lenhart used WPA instead of WEP.  In the third panel, the autoconfig then connects to Cueball's Bluetooth phone and uses it to call a local school in order to locate the Lenhart children, which are attending there, and it reports that it has found them. It acts on this information in the fourth panel, notifying ""field agents"" to kidnap the Lenhart children, and then reports that the children are acquired (very fast it seems). With the children as hostages, the program begins negotiations with the parents, offering their safe return in exchange for the Wi-Fi password.   This puns on the computing sense of ""negotiation"": network protocols (such as HTTP) often specify routines whereby a server and a client computer can agree on the best format in which data can be transferred. This is called content negotiation or format negotiation (see for example section 3.4 of the specification for ""semantics and content"" in HTTP).  Cueball, frightened by these actions, repeatedly presses Ctrl+C in an attempt to cancel the process, with little success. Ctrl+C is used to abort programs started from a terminal (Unix/Linux) or a command line prompt (cmd.exe under Windows). Part of the humor is that he only attempts to cancel quite late in the process, well after (for instance) the school was first called.  The title text mentions Ubuntu, a Linux distribution that attempts to be as user-friendly as possible. Randall mentions that he has heard that this ""user-friendly"" Zealous Autoconfig option has already been installed in the latest Ubuntu release...  Problems that arise when you leave decisions to a computer program are also explored in depth in comic 1619: Watson Medical Algorithm.","[Cueball sitting on a chair with his laptop in his lap.

424: Security Holes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/424:_Security_Holes,linux,True story: I had to try several times to upload this comic because my ssh key was blacklisted.,"The ""Debian-OpenSSL fiasco"" was a major security problem discovered in the Debian Linux distribution and its version of the cryptographic library called OpenSSL. With just a tiny change in the software, which was intended to have no effect on security, its random number generator was completely crippled, as was the security of all cryptographic keys generated by the system. The problem was created when a Debian developer removed one line of code which was crucial, even though it could seem like it did nothing useful. More detail about the fiasco: Crippling Crypto: The Debian OpenSSL Debacle, Debian's information page about the problem.  The title text refers also to this issue: After the security problem was found, all cryptographic keys generated or used on the broken operating system needed to be replaced. Many systems introduced special checks for such weak keys, adding the keys to blacklists, thereby preventing their use and forcing users to create new keys. Randall claims he was affected by that when uploading this comic to the server.  The comics on the left presents Cueball as a programmer who, on a whim, removes pieces of code (commenting out the code by prepending the line with two slashes), presumably thinking they are not necessary. The first removed line, MD_update(&m, buf, j); is the exact piece of code which was removed in the Debian fiasco. The next panels show him commenting out fictitious lines of code apparently preventing bad things from happening.  The other part of the comic lists ""security problems"" which were allegedly discovered in other Linux variants afterwards:  Cryptographic software in Fedora Core was allegedly not secure against toy decoder rings.   Xandros (used in Asus Eee PC netbooks) gave superuser privileges to anybody ""if asked in a stern voice"". This is likely a reference to fact that the preinstalled Xandros OS did not require a password for root privileges by default.  Gentoo would succumb to flattery, which may be a reference to Gentoo's notorious difficulty to manage. Any user who is capable of understanding it, might have a large ego, and therefore be susceptible to flattery.  OLPC OS could have been attacked using Jeff Goldblum's laptop computer, which refers to a scene in the Independence Day movie, where Jeff Goldblum's character was able to hack into an alien spaceship using his Apple PowerBook computer - which is a topic of great contempt by geeks who point to the absurdity of such a construction.  Slackware gave superuser privileges to anybody who ""says Elvish word for 'friend'"", which refers to a scene in The Lord of the Rings, where the entrance door to Moria could have been opened using a password mellon, the Elvish word for ""friend"", as indicated on the door itself.  And Ubuntu, which is another Linux distribution, was allegedly found to be actually Windows Vista, the latest version of Microsoft Windows at this time in 2008. This may be a reference to Ubuntu being developed with non-advanced users in mind, with many fail-safes and additional features being turned on by default, which had more in common with Windows than any other Linux-based operating system at the time.","[Cueball sitting at computer.] Cueball: I'll just comment out these lines...  // MD_update(&m, buf, j);  // do_not_crash();  // prevent_911();  In the rush to clean up the debian-openssl fiasco, a number of other major security holes have been uncovered:    Affected system   Security problem   Fedora Core   Vulnerable to certain decoder rings   Xandros (EEE PC)   Gives root access if asked in a stern voice   Gentoo   Vulnerable to flattery   OLPC OS   Vulnerable to Jeff Goldblum's Powerbook   Slackware   Gives root access if user says Elvish word for ""friend""   Ubuntu   Turns out distro is actually just Windows Vista with a few custom Themes"
434: xkcd Goes to the Airport,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/434:_xkcd_Goes_to_the_Airport,linux,"Under three ounces, but it stains panties.","The various characters of xkcd cause problems at the airport due to their various quirks.  Panel 1: Beret Guy and Megan are lost, following each other in a loop. Beret Guy displays his obsession with baked goods as he also does in later comics: 442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel and 452: Mission.  Panel 2: Cueball tries to carry a lockpick set (a tool able to unlock doors without the original key) through security. The security guard tells Cueball that he has to come with him, but Cueball wants to tell the guard about ""this hacker girl"" before going with the guard. This may be spoofing the incidents where someone has been manipulated into smuggling drugs or other contraband by a romantic interest they met on the Internet. The hacker girl could be Elaine from the 1337-series.  Panel 3: On the plane, Cueball has been instructed to disable the wireless transmission functionality of his device. Many airlines require passengers to disable mobile phones on aircraft as well as other radio transmitting devices because they may interfere with the radio-based navigation and communication equipment of the aircraft. However, his laptop is running Linux and he doesn't know how to change the wireless settings; he's reading the manual for the program that controls the wireless radio. However, this is probably not the ideal situation, as the airplane is pressed to take off. Man page was also referenced in 293: RTFM. Much later a plane was again linked to a man page in 912: Manual Override.  Panel 4: Black Hat tries to carry a container of liquid through security. According to US law, the maximum amount of liquid that can be taken onto a plane in a container is three ounces, a security measure taken to prevent terrorists from taking explosives onto planes. When the guard has doubts about the amount of liquid in the vial, Black Hat implies that the liquid is actually blood from a churchmouse.  This is referred to later in 526: Converting to Metric, which claims that a fieldmouse has much less blood than that.  The guard is visibly uncomfortable and clearly does not want to deal with the issue any further.  The title text continues off the final panel, saying that there are less than three ounces of blood in a churchmouse, but it ""stains panties"", an undesirable scenario. However, this undesirable scenario is paralleled by the implied undesirable scenario of a terrorist attack due to explosive liquids, the possibility of which caused the law. The title text seems to parody the prospect of an explosion with the relatively insignificant staining of panties, a term for women's underwear. This may also be a menstruation joke.","[Standing outside the Airport. There is a sign saying ""Airport"" and a plane in the background.] Megan: Okay, what airline? Beret Guy: I'm following you. Megan: ...I'm following you. Beret Guy: I assumed we were walking to the bakery. Megan: You always assume that!  [Presumably the security checkpoint.] Security Guy: Lockpicks?

456: Cautionary,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/456:_Cautionary,linux,"This really is a true story, and she doesn't know I put it in my comic because her wifi hasn't worked for weeks.","Cueball's cousin decides to install Linux on her new PC, and calls Cueball, whom she views as her personal Linux expert. The overarching joke revolves around the fact that Linux, especially home PC-based GNU/Linux, is much more often used as a ""hobby"" OS, as compared against a ""productivity"" OS such as Windows or OS X. Large numbers of people use Windows or Mac by default, because it came with their computer hardware when they bought it, and it already had the software suite they wanted to use installed along with it. Linux, on the other hand, rarely comes pre-installed on PC hardware and generally must be deliberately chosen and acquired; and while it can be set up to achieve efficient and productive workflow in virtually any area on PCs, because it often must be consciously selected, installed, and configured by users, it tends to either attract or, in a few cases, create individuals who take disproportionate pleasure in, and derive self-identification from, hacking the operating system itself. Thus, many people who are Linux enthusiasts began by not really knowing anything about it other than that it's free of cost, but the process of actually building Linux on their machines gradually led them to take an increasing interest in it, which the comic humorously likens to substance addiction.  Xorg (officially X.Org) is an implementation of the X Window System, a program responsible for the graphical display used on Linux. If it has configuration problems, which was quite common with some video card drivers back in 2008 (especially those  for ATI Radeon cards), it is often difficult and/or painful to fix (see 963: X11). Man pages are manual pages for Unix-based operating systems and software, usually accessible online but also bundled with the software itself.  Considered helpful and clear by the sorts of advanced computer users who typically run Linux, the text only documentation requires a bit of a learning curve and not generally adequate for less-technical users.  Here the joke starts to build in that Cueball's friend, a computer novice who just wanted something to work out of the box, is now having to learn how to understand Linux documentation in order to even 'attempt' to fix her ongoing Xorg problem (likely an inability to start a graphical terminal, something a novice user would depend on).  In the third panel we see that the friend's problems are persisting.  She may have been able to get a graphical terminal to work, but now Ubuntu's built-in auto configuration tools are failing to 'address' another critical problem, and possibly getting in the way of fixes suggested in the previously mentioned man pages.  The friend suggests that she is considering a more ""advanced"" distribution in the hopes that they might offer some additional flexibility to fix the problem at hand. A Linux ""distribution"" is a suite of tools and applications that provide a specific user experience on top of the core Linux operating system. Each distribution, or ""distro"", has a different look and feel, and different feature sets and design philosophies. Ubuntu is a very popular ""beginner"" version of Linux, designed to ""just work"" and be familiar/usable to people fresh out of Windows. Debian is a popular but somewhat more ""advanced"", ""Unix-like, distro, that is nevertheless considered mainstream with a huge and diverse base of supported software that generally requires more Linux know-how to configure and use.  In fact Ubuntu is based on Debian and it would not be considered much of a leap for an Ubuntu user to switch.  Gentoo, on the other hand, is a very advanced distro allowing for extreme customization and optimization but requiring extensive install and setup time.  It is generally considered to be the most difficult form of Linux to use and is often joked about as being a form of technological masochism.  It appears that during her six weeks struggle to build her system, Cueball's friend has started to consider that her problem would require a solution that could only be accommodated by Gentoo.  In the fourth panel there is a strong implication that the friend has indeed switched to Gentoo because a hallmark of that distribution is the kernel (the basic core of the operating system) must be compiled from source code upon installation.  Source code is a computer program expressed in an somewhat human-readable format, often simply as text. However, source code cannot be run directly by a computer, and instead needs to be ""compiled"" into a low level machine instructions the computer can understand. This means that with Gentoo, instead of downloading an already functional Linux system to install and run, users download the source code for the system, customize it to their own needs, then compile the code into a runnable version of the OS, all before they can begin to use the system. The friend has been forced to do this because whatever her problem is, the solution required a customized kernel.  This could include needing the kernel to be compiled in a non-standard way not supported by more mainstream distros, incorporating experimental third party code into the kernel or modifying the kernel herself to fix the problem.  Compiling a kernel with the aforementioned modifications is a tricky affair since any mistake or oversight can render the kernel, and thus the computer, non-functional.  If a mistake is made or the custom kernel does not fix her problem  the kernel needs to be compiled anew.  The fourth panel also implies the friend has been stuck in a Trial and error loop, compiling the kernel over and over again for the better part of 6 weeks in an attempt to fix her problem.   To many such advanced users, their installation of Linux is like a hobby sportscar: A never-ending project, constantly tweaked and cleaned and adjusted to improve performance, that spends far more time sitting around with its hood open than actually being used for its ostensible purpose.  However, for more typical users who are interested in a functional computer system instead of a toy or project system, Linux can be highly frustrating, requiring far more time and effort just to bring the system to the point where they can use it for what they wanted to do all along.  By week 12, Cueball's friend is likely suffering from the Sunk cost fallacy, in that she believes that since she has put in so much time she needs to see it through.  She might also be optimistically underestimating how much additional work will be required since at each point Linux does at least offer potential solutions due to its customizability.  Finally there could be an element of Target fixation, in that the friend has become so focused on the problem, she has forgotten about her original plans for the computer or that Windows is still an option.   In the fifth panel, Randal riffs on the old anti-drug message ""Parents, talk to your kids about drugs before someone else does"", with the meaning being if a responsible adult does not educate their kids about the dangers of drugs (or Linux), then someone else (likely a peer) might convince them that drugs (or Linux) is a good idea.  This brings us to the overall theme of the comic in that Linux might 'seem' like a good idea for the average, less-technical user, but in reality will open up a world of pain that will hinder their ability to be a computationally functional member of society.  There is an additional call to the theory of gateway drugs where mild drugs like alcohol or cannabis will lead to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin.  In the comic, Cueball's friend starts out with Ubuntu, a ""gateway"" version of Linux.  However it quickly leads to harder and harder versions, all in a futile effort to solve her problem, with the end result being her vanishing for weeks inside her house like a junkie hopelessly hooked on drugs.   The title text continues the joke about Linux's poor support for many Wi-Fi cards common in 2008, a device that is not only well supported on Windows, but was typically seen as making networking easy for less technical users.  While the comic primarily pokes fun at the difficulties in using Linux (circa 2008), it indirectly shows some of the advantages.  The first one is that it is a freely available alternative to Windows and the second is that it provides users the tools to make fixing problems possible, whereas with Windows the only problems that are fixed are the ones Microsoft chooses to fix.  The comic is also somewhat anachronistic as over time hardware support in Linux has become much more robust.  It is currently unlikely that Cueball's friend would wind up in kernel compile hell to enable basic functions such as graphics and Wi-Fi.  The world's most popular operating system, Android, is a flavor of Linux and the growth of web-based applications have pushed much of even the desktop user experience into the browser.  As of 2017 it would be unlikely that the friend would even consider a desktop computer, instead relying on her Android phone or tablet.","Linux: A True Story: [Cueball talks on a cell phone.] Week One: Cousin: Hey, it's your cousin.

Cueball has created a patch that allows support for processors with 4,096 cores, even though most computers have only 8 cores or fewer. He considers this to be more worthwhile an endeavor than full-featured Flash support, which is much more commonly used. Flash movies are known for their bad performance and high consumption on CPU power compared with other movie formats. Cueball's friend is uninterested in the 4,096-core-processor fix, and only wants to know if it will help him with Flash video.  However, as of 2013, there are commercial computer systems that can be actually configured up to 2,048 cores (4,096 threads), e.g. SGI UV 2000.

644: Surgery,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/644:_Surgery,linux,"Damn. Not only did he not install it, he sutured a 'Vista-Ready' sticker onto my arm.","Linux is an open source kernel for an operating system. Linux is notorious for its less-than-perfect support for hardware, although support for most hardware is eventually patched into the official kernel release. Cueball is here under the impression that support for a USB port can be patched into his arm in a similar fashion to how hardware support can be added to the Linux kernel.  The ""Vista-Ready"" sticker in the title text is a humorous indication from the doctor that the patient is ""advanced enough"" to have Windows Vista installed. The irony is multilayered. There was a lawsuit against Microsoft about promoting not-so-capable computers as ""Windows Vista Capable""; they could neither run Vista fully nor smoothly. On top of that, the typical Linux user would not be very enthusiastic about Windows at all; someone who runs Linux has actively chosen an alternative operating system.","[A surgeon is standing over a patient on a gurney.] Patient: While you're doing the surgery, can you also implant this in my arm?  Surgeon: A USB port? Patient: Just wire it up to some nerves.  Surgeon: ...This won't let your brain control USB devices, you know. Patient: Sure – I just want the hardware.  Patient: The rest is software; I'm sure there will be a project to patch together support eventually. Surgeon: Ah – you're a Linux user, I see. Patient: Yeah, how'd you know?"
797: debian-main,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/797:_debian-main,linux,dpkg: error processing package (--purge): subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit 163: OH_GOD_THEYRE_INSIDE_MY_CLOTHES,"Debian is a Linux distribution most notable for introducing APT (Advanced Packaging Tool). APT is a tool that functions as an automated general software installer for Linux systems; all one has to do is tell it what software package they would like to install, and the program will automatically fetch the software and all of its dependencies (other packages that a program relies on, such as a library for processing ZIP archives) from a central repository. It will also automatically handle upgrades by automatically checking if the repository version of a package is higher than the currently installed version, and it can even handle the use of multiple repositories and linking between them; for example, if a piece of software is deemed worthy of inclusion in Debian's main repository, but as a stable release, the software developers can provide their own repository to provide a more experimental version for users who want it, and once that repository is added to APT's source list, APT will automatically realize that it should use the experimental version, since it has a higher version than that of the main repository. Although this wasn't the first package management system for easy Linux installation (that honor goes to RPM), it is the first one that seamlessly integrated online installation and upgrades into the mix.  debian-main is Debian's main repository, included by default in all Debian installations. It's what you might call the ""canon"" of Debian, containing only those packages that have been approved by official Debian developers. Thus, getting a package on debian-main means that it, theoretically, conforms to a standard of quality.  In this case, however, the Debian developers seem to have not noticed that one of the dependencies for the package is ""locusts."" Locusts are real insects, the migratory forms of several grasshopper species, that are best known for breeding extremely quickly, swarming, and devouring all green plant matter they come across, resulting in crop devastation (some consider this a plague). In some parts of the world they are also considered a delicacy. Cueball probably does not appreciate this as they crawl over his body searching for food, apparently spontaneously generated by APT as it saw that it needed ""locusts"" to install the package.  The title text is an error line from dpkg, the program used to install/remove APT packages. Every package contains several scripts (although some of them may be empty) that are run on various events related to that package; these are used to perform any setup/cleanup tasks the package needs. This line is an error line indicating that one of those scripts has failed. The relevant portions are:","AAAAAAAA [A swarm of insects cover Cueball and his computer. He is leaning back on their chair, flailing to get away.]  My package made it into Debian-main because it looked innocuous enough; no one noticed ""locusts"" in the dependency list."
824: Guest Week: Bill Amend (FoxTrot),http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/824:_Guest_Week:_Bill_Amend_(FoxTrot),linux,"Guest comic by Bill Amend of FoxTrot, an inspiration to all us nerdy-physics-majors-turned-cartoonists, of which there are an oddly large number.","Bill Amend, author of the newspaper comic FoxTrot, draws for Randall in this special 'Guest Week' edition of xkcd. In the first two panels, we see Jason Fox, a geeky 10-year-old from Amend's strip. Jason asks to draw comics for Randall. When Randall refuses, he uses the sudo command, used in POSIX systems to perform an action as an administrator/super user. This forces Randall to agree. This is a reference to the very popular comic 149: Sandwich, which has now become a geek culture catch-phrase.  In the first comic, Cueball is making a pun on the word attractive. In the first context it means a person is  ""good looking"" or ""beautiful"" which the (presumably) female character attributes to her hair. In Cueball's context, it means that he is feeling an increased gravitational pull from the woman, due to her increase in mass (see Gravitation). This setup is also very typical of the Jason Fox character, who, ostensibly ten, is supposed to be too young to like girls.  Werner Heisenberg postulated in 1927, his eponymous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which roughly states that in quantum mechanics one cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle. The joke is that (presumably) Elisabeth Heisenberg does not know the position of her keys, because she knows too much about their (the keys') momentum. (This is also the subject of 1473: Location Sharing.)  In many parliamentary and congressional halls it is customary, when calling an issue to vote to have the people who want the issue at hand to be passed to say out loud that they agree. The customary response to this is to say ""aye."" The dissenters are then asked. Their response would be ""nay"" or ""no"". Then the volume (by rough decibels) of the assenters and dissenters are weighed. If it is close, a more formal vote may be called. ""Aye"" is pronounced the same way as the letter ""i"" and ""i"" is the mathematical value of the square root of negative one, which can be used to represent an imaginary number.  The title text of this comic draws attention to the fact that there are a number of notable people who have become famous as cartoonists, but also hold degrees in physics or have a strong interest in physics. This might seem unusual, because the average person might see physics and art as incompatible, and this is why Randall writes ""an oddly large number."" These people include:   Guest Week was a series of five comics written by five other comic authors. They were released over five consecutive days (Monday-Friday); not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule. The five comics are:","[Jason from FoxTrot is sitting at an artist's desk with a pencil, holding a phone.] Jason: Hi, Mr. Munroe? I have a great idea! Let me draw some strips for you!

838: Incident,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/838:_Incident,linux,"He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake, he's copied on /var/spool/mail/root, so be good for goodness' sake.","This comic was posted on Christmas Eve. While Christmas is principally a Christian reimagining of a Pagan holiday, celebrating the birth of Jesus on December 25, there are many traditions around the holiday, among them a tradition that on Christmas Eve Santa Claus will make his round delivering gifts to good children.  Rob sits behind a Linux computer and tried to change his user account from his normal access to the access of a super user by using the command ""sudo su"". Sudo is a famous phrase in xkcd lore, made famous by comic 149: Sandwich. Before allowing administrator access (as root user), it asks for a password. The field is blank because, in most Linux systems, the characters of the password are not shown. When Rob is unable to use the command his account is not authorized and the system says that the incident ""will be reported"" (usually to the system administrator, so he can see if someone is making repeated attempts at accessing administrator privileges).  In the comic, however, sudo and the system report the incidents to Santa Claus, who, in Christmas lore, makes a list of who is naughty and who is nice. If you are nice then you get presents, while if you are naughty, you get a lump of coal. When sudo reports to Santa that Rob's account is not authorized, he puts Rob on the naughty list.  In the title text, which is a parody of the famous Christmas song, ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"", /var/spool/mail/root is the root (superuser) mailbox on a Linux system, where the incident described in the comic would commonly be reported to.","[Rob is sitting at a computer. The computer's prompt is shown.]  [Megan approaches.] Rob: Hey — who does sudo report these ""incidents"" to? Megan: You know, I've never checked.

910: Permanence,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/910:_Permanence,linux,This hostname is going in dozens of remote config files. Changing a kid's name is comparatively easy!,"Choosing a name for a server is both an important and non-trivial task. It is non-trivial enough that there are official communications on how to choose a good name and why many ideas are bad, for example RFC 1178 Name Your Computer. It is important to pick a good name because changing it is costly once many reference to the existing name are widespread. For example, RFC 1178 states:  So Cueball wants to make sure that he chooses a great permanent name, that he can give to the server he is running.   When Megan quips on how quickly Cueball named their daughter Caroline (a living being - that is, the type of entity that would give the server purpose), Cueball retorts that he was under pressure at the time: Megan tried to name said daughter ""Epidural"" in honor of the painkiller drugs that were being injected into her spine at the time. Megan tries to justify this by explaining that those were very good drugs, but thus also confirms Cueball in that she was drugged, not in her right mind, and thus not making good decisions (despite epidurals working by stopping nerves in the spinal cord from transmitting signals, and would not have an affect on the brain seen in someone given an opiate or narcotic. She may, however, have been motivated purely by the fact that the drug stopped the pain of labor or a cesarean section).  In the title text Cueball mentions that he thinks that it is easier to change a person's name than to change the hostname of a server because of the number of changes that would need to be made to each of the machines that would have saved the old name of the server. It seems, however, that Cueball has never had to wait in line at the Social Security Administration office or at the Department of Motor Vehicles, as both of those events typically take excruciatingly long amounts of time. On the top panel is the sketch of a Debian Installer showing hostname dialog for its menu-driven frontend.","[A large panel the combined width of the four panels below it.] [A blue Linux terminal installer screen with a grey box that is labeled ""[!]CONFIGURE THE NETWORK"" in red.

Cueball: Picking a good server name is important.  [Megan stares at him.]  [She continues to stare.]  [Cueball pushes his chair back, puts one elbow on the back of the chair and points with his other hand at the screen.] Megan: And yet you settled on ""Caroline"" for our daughter in like 15 seconds. Cueball: But this is a server! Besides, I had to—you were trying to name her ""epidural."" Megan: Those were good drugs."
912: Manual Override,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/912:_Manual_Override,linux,I think you mean 'GNU Info Override'.,"There are two jokes in this comic. The first is that the pilot typed ""man override"" to manually override the plane's computer and steer the plane to safety, but instead he ends up opening the manual page for ""OVERRIDE"". The second joke is making fun of a trend in documentation for Unix-like systems using the free GNU toolchain.  Historically, UNIX systems had a way to access descriptions of the available programs by using the ""man"" command (from ""manual""). Typing ""man [program name]"" would output a concise, helpful text, called a ""man page"", describing the program's functionality, available command-line options, a list of related programs, etc. For some GNU-based systems, however, the output of ""man [program name]"" will be entirely too brief, mainly telling what the program does, then directing the user to invoke a GNU-specific information system (GNU Info). GNU Info pages can be quite useful, e.g. they often contain much more information than man pages, and are hypertextual, allowing quick navigation through a network of content-related Info pages; however, they often are much more complex to search through than simple man files, which take the form of single scrollable pages, one per program.  As such, the humour is predicated upon understanding the frustration which sometimes arises when GNU/Linux users seek out a man page, hoping for an easy, digestible read, only to find that the man page they opened merely redirects them to another, less accessible network of hypertext Info pages. This can be especially annoying when it interrupts a person's workflow; e.g. when what they wanted was to spend three seconds looking up the proper format of a particular command line function, and instead they end up redirected to a maze of detailed documentation. To add injury to the insult, sometimes the Info pages aren't actually installed, causing the ""info"" viewer to just render the same old ""man"" page that had the directions in the first place.  The title text provides a tongue-in-cheek correction to the comic's title, suggesting that rather than typing ""man(ual) override"", the user/pilot should type ""info override"" to search GNU Info instead.","[A plane is in a nosedive with smoke pouring from one wing. Text comes from someone reading in the cockpit.] ""This is the emergency override system, which can be used to regain control of the aircraft. Complete instructions for activating this system are available as a GNU info page."""
981: Porn Folder,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/981:_Porn_Folder,linux,"Eww, gross, you modified link()? How could you enjoy abusing a filesystem like that?","Cueball seems to have found a porn folder. However, it contains a directory loop, set up by a person off-screen. It is possible to actually do this, but it is widely regarded as a very bad idea, as it can break the system in not-so-obvious ways (mostly by causing seemingly-trivial operations to infinite loop). The implication is that the folder does not need to contain pornographic images because the folder is the porn—its violation of the taboo against looping is something the off-screen character finds erotic.  link() is the Linux system call to create a hard link. In an unmodified Linux kernel, it will not allow directory hard links for this exact reason; the person who set up the porn folder apparently ""forced"" Linux to comply, with all of the sexual analogies that suggests.","[Cueball sits at a desk, looking at a laptop screen with one hand on his chin.] Cueball: So I thought I found your porn folder, in calendar/backup/PORN Friend (off screen): Don't open that!  [A wider shot of the person looking at the laptop.] Cueball: But it contains a bunch more folders, filled with more folders, and then... after 20 levels, somehow I'm back at the main folder? Friend (off screen): It's, uh, well hidden.  [Cueball has turned around in the chair, now with the laptop in his lap.] Cueball: I think there's no actual porn here. Cueball: You're just turned on by filesystems. Friend (off screen): It's a hardlinked directory loop - so taboo! Cueball: Now I feel dirty sharing a drive with you."
1084: Server Problem,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1084:_Server_Problem,linux,Protip: Annoy Ray Kurzweil by always referring to it as the 'Cybersingularity'.,"Cueball has messed up his Linux server, apparently not for the first time. Megan offers to take a look at the PC, and she casually types in 'ls' — a very basic command that lists the files in the current directory. The computer returns a bizarre error message — it trips over one of the simplest commands, indicating that Cueball's system is messed up. Really messed up.  The /usr/share path should indicate ""architecture-independent shared data"". Adobe is a software company that produces Acrobat, Flash and Photoshop. Android VM would be a virtual machine for Android. The .jar extension suggests a Java-language program. None of Adobe software, Android, or Java are needed to run 'ls'. All of the above have nothing to do with each other, with the exception that Android applications (but not core command line utilities, like ls) are written in Java. Also, basic system executables like 'ls' would never be placed within /usr/share or within some 'example' or 'doc' directory. On Linux, executables don't have filename extensions like "".exe"" or "".jar"". Additionally, it would require the folder to be within $PATH. In other words, the error message implies that the server is in a very bad state.  In the last frame Megan is bewildered by this result and asks what did you do. Cueball suggest a course of action which mimics a common error message: ""______ is busy, please try again later."" Obviously he has seen this type of message frequently enough to try it as a general cure in all similar cases.  Megan then tells Cueball to ""shut down the system and wait for the singularity,"" referring to a hypothetical future event when superintelligence can be artificially created. Since future superintelligent humans/computers transcend our comprehension, we can't predict or even understand what will happen after the singularity. One interpretation is that Megan is telling Cueball that his system is such a mess that it will take a post-singularity superintelligence to fix it (or run it in its current state, as only an intelligence beyond present comprehension would be capable of doing). It also indicates that 1668: Singularity could be the sequel to this comic.  The title text is yet another protip from Randall. Ray Kurzweil is an author and futurist who has talked and written much about a technological singularity. Presumably, mangling the jargon (by confusing the concept of the ""singularity"" with the science fiction term ""cyberspace"") is something Kurzweil (as an expert) would find annoying. Also, as Randall later pointed out in 1573: Cyberintelligence, the word has not really been used for a decade...","[Cueball at his computer calls out for Megan who comes walking in to the frame.] Cueball: I, um, messed up my server again. Megan: I'll take a look.

Megan: You should shut down this system and wait for the Singularity."
156: Commented,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/156:_Commented,programming,Your IDE's color may vary.,"When Cueball asks Black Hat for a favor, he seems to be making a rude gesture, by lifting a finger towards Cueball. The word he says Commented! does, however, not seem to fit with the shorter four letter word usually combined with such a gesture.   Cueball also fails to understand this, but as it turns out, as the panels move around Black Hat and zooms in on his fingers, he is not making this rude gesture, but is instead actually lifting two fingers toward Cueball, forming a double slash and thereby ignoring both him and his question for a favor, by commenting him out programming style, even to the point where Black Hat sees the commenting out slashes, Cueball, and anything he says in the color for ignored parts of the program (or real world in this case).  In certain programming languages (including but not limited to C (since C99), C++, C#, Java, Javascript, PHP, and Scala), inserting a double slash (//) in a line marks everything after the double slash in the line as a ""comment,"" i.e. something for humans to read that generally helps them understand the code better, rather than something for the computer to execute. Since all comment lines are ignored when a program is run or compiled, it is possible to simply put a double slash in front of any line of code to skip that line. This is known as ""commenting out"" the line.  An Integrated Development Environment (IDE for short) is an application that programmers use to write, compile, execute, and debug code. Many IDEs color-code text to make reading the code easier. In IDEs like Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio, a line that is commented out will be colored green; however, the color may vary depending on which IDE you use, and can usually also be customized. The title text refers to this variation among IDEs' color schemes.","[Cueball calls out to and Black Hat while they are some distance apart as seen from the side. Black Hat is holding an arm out towards Cueball making a gesture and speaking one word.] Cueball: Hey, can you do me a favor? Black Hat: Commented!  [The same setting seen from behind Black Hat with Cueball drawn much smaller in the background.] Cueball: Huh?  [Black Hat's hand is shown in close up. He is holding his first and second fingers parallel and at an angle towards the ""small"" Cueball to the left of the hand. The two fingers, as well as Cueball and his next line, are green.] Cueball: Wait, what does that gesture even mean?"
163: Donald Knuth,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/163:_Donald_Knuth,programming,His books were kinda intimidating; rappelling down through his skylight seemed like the best option.,"Donald Knuth is a computer science Professor Emeritus at Stanford University who is famous for writing The Art of Computer Programming and developing the TeX computerized typesetting system.  An array in computer science is a structure that stores multiple values in a fixed order, and the elements are accessed by their index number.  In Pascal, for instance, one writes array[1] to access the first element in the array. Most ""modern"" (read: descended from C) languages use 0 as the index for the first element in the array, but it is possible (if one is careful about it) to ignore the 0th element and use 1 as the first index. In some programming languages (such as Ada) it is possible to select an arbitrary range of indices for each array type, so the first index might be not only 0 or 1 but even 100000. Cueball is complaining that Black Hat was not consistent in his choice of where to start his arrays. This is a valid complaint, as a lack of such consistency can make coding errors both more likely and less easy to detect.  Black Hat cites Donald Knuth to support his rebuttal, but the quote he uses does not seem relevant.  It turns out that Black Hat had illegally entered the professor's house in order to question him on indices. Donald Knuth's words were not an intellectual response to the question, but rather an alarmed response to the presence of an intruder.  It is not clear if Black Hat is aware of this.  The title text suggests that Black Hat finds Donald's books intimidating, due to perhaps their size or complexity, to the extent that he considers breaking into Donald's house (a risky, difficult crime) to be the better option in finding his answer. Even for Donald Knuth's books, this is very exaggerated and illogical behaviour.    🐸","[Black Hat and Cueball are sitting back to back at two separate desks, typing.] Cueball: Man, you're being inconsistent with your array indices. Some are from one, some are from zero. Black Hat: Different tasks call for different conventions. To quote Stanford algorithm's expert Donald Knuth, ""Who are you? How did you get in my house?"" Cueball: Wait, what? Black Hat: Well, that's what he said when I asked him about it."
217: e to the pi Minus pi,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/217:_e_to_the_pi_Minus_pi,programming,"Also, I hear the 4th root of (9^2 + 19^2/22) is pi.","e is a mathematical constant roughly equal to 2.71828182846. π is another, roughly equal to 3.14159265359. Both are transcendental numbers.  The first panel discusses eπ − π, which is around 19.999099979 — very close to 20.  Black Hat explains how he tricked a programming team into believing that eπ − π is close enough to 20 that the computer should be unable to tell the difference, and that any noticeable deviation from 20 results from errors in the code. This made them waste a lot of time trying to find a nonexistent bug until they realized that Black Hat was lying (clearly they had not known him for very long).  Floating point numbers are how computers store non-integer real numbers as decimals — or rather, in most cases, approximate them: infinite amounts of data would be required to represent most numbers in decimal form (exceptions are whole numbers and terminating decimals). The ""floating-point handlers"" would be the code performing the eπ − π calculation.  ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery, sponsoring the International Collegiate Programming Contest.  Some random facts about the math here:  The title text pokes fun at another coincidence: ∜(9² + 19²/22) ≈ 3.1415926525, close to π (deviating only in the 9th decimal place). The humor comes from the fact that π is transcendental. Transcendental numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed through basic arithmetic with integers; one cannot end up with the exact value for any transcendental number (including π) by adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, exponentiating, and/or taking the nth root of any whole number, meaning the title text cannot possibly be true.  A much later comic, 1047: Approximations, puts forth quite a few more mathematical coincidences.","Cueball: Hey, check it out: eπ − π is 19.999099979. That's weird. Black Hat: Yeah. That's how I got kicked out of the ACM in college. Cueball: ...what? Black Hat: During a competition, I told the programmers on our team that eπ − π was a standard test of floating-point handlers -- it would come out to 20 unless they had rounding errors. Cueball: That's awful. Black Hat: Yeah, they dug through half their algorithms looking for the bug before they figured it out."
221: Random Number,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/221:_Random_Number,programming,RFC 1149.5 specifies 4 as the standard IEEE-vetted random number.,"The comic specifies a function (in a C-like syntax), which judging by its name should be designed to return a random number. Most functions of this form are random number generators, meaning that on subsequent calls they return different random numbers. But the programmer has instead implemented a function that just returns the same random number each time, which, while it could indeed have been truly randomly chosen by rolling a die as the comment documented, is essentially worthless were it ever to be called more than once (with the expectation of different, i.e., random, results).  In other words, the results over time would not be random at all, but completely predictable and deterministic.  The IEEE is the organization responsible for maintaining a number of computer standards. An RFC, or Request for Comments, is a formal document put out to computing experts by IETF in the hopes of becoming a future standard. However, RFC 1149 was an April Fools' joke, defining how carrier pigeons can be used to transmit Internet packets. ""RFC 1149.5"", meanwhile, simply does not exist.",int getRandomNumber() { return 4; // chosen by fair dice roll. // guaranteed to be random. }
224: Lisp,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/224:_Lisp,programming,We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.,"Lisp is a computer programming language with simple, highly regular syntax. The language's most notable feature is that programs take the same form as the language's primary data structure (the linked list). This blurs the line between code and data and permits programs to inspect and even alter their own source code, thereby opening up deep opportunities for metaprogramming. Lisp is also a functional programming language (though not purely functional, as some more recent languages are), meaning that programs are expressed in terms that are simple elaborations or extensions of the lambda calculus, a formal mathematical model of computation. This gives programs written in functional languages such as Lisp a distinctively abstract, mathematical form that is commonly considered difficult to fully grok (see 1270: Functional).  The phrase A suffusion of blue is a reference to Douglas Adams' book The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul. In it, an I Ching calculator calculates that everything above the value of 4 is a suffusion of yellow.  In the comic, Cueball marvels at the fundamental and complete nature of the language of creation that he sees in his dream. In the Lisp programming language, ""car"" is a primitive (i.e. basic) function that produces the first item in a list. The line ""My God, It's full of 'car's"" is a pun, most likely referring to the movie 2010: The Year We Make Contact, the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. In the book 2001: A Space Odyssey, when astronaut David Bowman accidentally activates a star gate, he exclaims as he enters it ""The thing's hollow — it goes on forever — and — oh my God - it's full of stars!"", although he does not say anything in the first movie during the final sequence.  In the second panel, Cueball remarks that, ""At once, just like they said, I felt a great enlightenment."" This is a reference to a pattern of observations among programmers and computer scientists that while Lisp often seems alien or arcane — even deliberately so, even to experienced hackers, even with repeated exposure over time — truly understanding Lisp in a deep, non-superficial way, results in a profound epiphany, a sudden and abiding illumination wherein one's preconceived notions about computation and programming are fundamentally transfigured, oftentimes over the course of a very short span such as during a single all-day hacking binge. Lispers commonly describe the experience as being akin to learning programming for the first time again; Daniel P. Friedman (author of much ground-breaking research and many popular introductory texts on Lisp and programming language design) described it as ""[learning] to think recursively,"" and contended that ""thinking about [functional] computing is one of the most exciting things the human mind can do.""  Cueball's remarks about patterns, metapatterns, and the disappearance of syntax are reactions to the elegant simplicity of the Lisp programming language, in which it is relatively easy to build immensely sophisticated programs using simple recursive elaborations of structure. This is fundamentally unlike the much more typical and common imperative programming languages, in which programs are written as chains of instructions for the machine to follow.  God replies that the universe was actually hacked together with the programming language Perl. Perl employs an idiosyncratic syntax that borrows liberally from a number of other languages. Although a versatile language often employed for assembling projects quickly (the much-loved Programming Perl introduces it as ""[the] language for getting your job done""), Perl has a reputation for being ugly and inelegant, partly as a result of its pidgin-like fusion of many inconsistent language elements and code styles. It was famously described as a ""Swiss-Army chainsaw,"" because it is very powerful but also unwieldy and unattractive. By way of contrast to Daniel Friedman above, Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, criticized the highly cerebral Lisp attitude toward programming with the words  The joke is that the Creator, like many software developers, was a bit rushed and chose to quickly throw together a working prototype rather than do the job right from the beginning; concurrently, that Cueball, thinking he has discovered an amazing and beautiful secret in the hidden world of Lisp, learns that in fact the real world is filled with ugly hacks and quick-and-dirty imperative code.  A (possible) hidden joke might be an oblique reference to Greenspun's tenth rule when God replies with ""I mean, ostensibly, yes."" Greenspun's tenth rule says that any sufficiently complex program written in another high level programming language will necessarily contain an imperfect, undocumented, slow, and bug-ridden implementation of about half of Common Lisp. Greenspun's tenth rule was meant to express the belief that Common Lisp, a large, full-featured Lisp dialect, is so flexible and robust that any attempt to render any really sophisticated program in most other languages requires the programmer to expend extraordinary effort unwittingly reinventing, in needlessly convoluted fashion, features and systems that would be elegant and trivial in Common Lisp. This explains why such a program might look or feel ""Lispy"" to an unfamiliar observer, and why the universe (if viewed as such a program) might look to mathematicians and scientists as though it probably has a beautifully simple mathematical basis, even if in reality it was just hacked together with a bunch of ersatz, special-case rules.  The title text continues the analogy by suggesting that the theory of quantum mechanics was written in regular expressions (""regexes""), a complex language for pattern matching used heavily in Perl. Regular expressions are often criticized as being a write-only language, that is, a language so complicated in syntax that any significant program written in them cannot be understood by anybody (often not even the original author). Documentation is essential to assist in the understanding of complex regular expressions. The title text claims that at some point, the documentation for quantum mechanics was lost, which explains why quantum mechanics is so bizarre and counterintuitive.","[Floating in space.] Speaker: Last night I drifted off while reading a Lisp book. Cueball: Huh? Speaker: Suddenly, I was bathed in a suffusion of blue.  [Floating in space before a vast concept tree.] Speaker: At once, just like they said, I felt a great enlightenment. I saw the naked structure of Lisp code unfold before me. Cueball: My God Cueball: It's full of 'car's Speaker: The patterns and metapatterns danced. Syntax faded, and I swam in the purity of quantified conception. Of ideas manifest.  [Close-up of floating in space before part of a concept tree.] Truly, this was the language from which the gods wrought the Universe.

234: Escape Artist,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/234:_Escape_Artist,programming,Easier to escape: n-layered nested quotes or an iron maiden?,"Harry Houdini (born Erik Weisz/Ehrich Weiss) was a famous escape artist, whose more famous routines included escaping straitjackets and switching places with an assistant while locked inside a box.  The word ""escape"" also has a meaning in computer science. To ""escape"" something in programming means to replace a character or character sequence that would usually have a special meaning with another character sequence that doesn't have this special meaning. One common way of escaping is to have a special escape character that removes the special meaning from whatever character follows it. For instance, many programming languages enclose text strings in quotation marks (e.g. ""this is a string""). If you tried to directly put a quotation mark inside the string, the compiler would interpret it as the end of the string. To avoid this, the quotation mark is escaped with a backslash: ""He said, \""Goodbye!\"", and went away.""  The problem Cueball is having is related to the fact that the Bash shell interprets spaces as a special syntactic marker, when he actually just wants the spaces to be literal space characters. In this case, escaping the spaces with \ would force Bash to interpret his script in this way.  (There is one other way the escape character is sometimes used, but we'll ignore it for the sake of explaining the comic.)  The person talking to Cueball is having a separate conversation about Houdini as Cueball thinks aloud about his script issue, which results in diverging conversations. This eventually leads Cueball to suggest that Houdini might have ""escaped"" (freed himself from) handcuffs by ""escaping"" (removing the special meaning from) them with backslashes.  Sometimes, escape characters need to be ""nested"" - the backslash character itself can be escaped as \\ to produce a literal backslash, so if, for example, one needs to produce a literal quotation mark to output to a script file, and that script file also needs to have the quotation mark escaped, one would need to type it out as \\\"", which would be output as \"". If I needed to actually output that \\\"", one would need to type it as \\\\\\\"". The number of backslashes needed grows, and can be very hard to keep track of (see 1638: Backslashes). This behavior is a type of n-level nested quotation mentioned in the title text. This could, in practice, be very easy with syntax highlighting showing where the parser sees the string as ending, making it trivial to escape out the characters that should be escaped, e.g.:  ""And then he said \""Hi\""."" In this example, the nested quotes could be escaped until the editor shows the uniform color of strings.   An iron maiden is supposedly a medieval torture device, currently believed to have been invented for tourism purposes much later than the time period when it was said to have been used. Harry Houdini's escapes include an escape from a purported ""iron maiden,"" although it only vaguely resembles the ""medieval"" torture device.","[Cueball sits before a computer on a desk while another man stands behind him.] Man: I was fascinated by locks as a kid. I loved how they turned information and patterns into physical strength. Cueball: Why does my script keep dying?  [Closeup on Cueball sitting at the computer.] Man: And a lock invites you to try and open it. It's the hacker instinct. Only your ignorance stands in the way. Cueball: Wait it's passing bad strings.  [Returns to the two shot of both men.] Man: I admired Harry Houdini, how he could open any lock and free himself from any restraint. Cueball: Ah - Bash is parsing the spaces.  Man: Sure some of it was fakery and showmanship. But I still wonder how he so consistently escaped handcuffs. Cueball: Backslashes? Man: Huh? Cueball: Never mind."
292: goto,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/292:_goto,programming,Neal Stephenson thinks it's cute to name his labels 'dengo',"Goto is a construct found in many computer languages that causes control flow to go from one place in program to another, without returning. Once common in computer programming, its popularity diminished in the 1960s and 1970s as focus on structured programming became the norm. Edsger W. Dijkstra's article ""Go To Statement Considered Harmful"" in particular contributed to the decline of goto.  Often people learning programming are told goto is bad and should be avoided, but frequently are not given a reason. In this case, Cueball can see no harm in using goto to avoid rewriting much of his program. As a result, he is attacked by a velociraptor. Velociraptor attacks are a running joke (and fear) often expressed in xkcd. The humor derives from the fact that a velociraptor attack is an unexpected and severe consequence of using a goto statement.  The title text refers to Neal Stephenson, an author of cyberpunk novels. A label is used in many programming languages to refer to a point in a program that a goto instruction can jump to. The joke is that one of Stephenson's characters in Cryptonomicon is named Goto Dengo... when said out loud, ""Dengo"" sounds like ""Then go"".  Like all velociraptors in xkcd, the velociraptor in this comic is specifically the man-sized movie monster from Jurassic Park.  Real velociraptors were more like carnivorous turkeys.  The beast devouring Cueball might actually be Deinonychus antirrhopus.","[Cueball sits at computer, thinking.] Cueball: I could restructure the program's flow - or use one little 'GOTO' instead.

297: Lisp Cycles,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/297:_Lisp_Cycles,programming,I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the MIT computer science program permamently.,"Lisp is one of the oldest high level programming languages. Despite being significantly ahead of its time, it never got enough traction outside of academia, and has never been widely used. However, it is considered to be a very powerful language even in the present day. Quotations regarding Lisp show that several big names in computer science and the tech industry hold Lisp in very high esteem. Eric S. Raymond goes as far as to say  Lisp is also famous for its use of fully parenthesized Polish prefix notation. As a result, Lisp programs take the form of enormous nested lists bounded by parentheses, and it is not uncommon to see the source code of a large Lisp program close off with an equally enormous stack of close-parens, representing the simultaneous termination of dozens of recursively and hierarchically nested functional and procedural structures.  In the first panel, Cueball praises Lisp, observing that no other language can match the awe that it still strikes despite its significant seniority.  In the second panel, Cueball proposes that new programmers might continue to learn Lisp forever; that despite the language's lack of widespread adoption, a small cadre of hackers will always exist who keep the language alive.  First, a little background:  Lisp was once the lingua franca of the frontier of computer science research at places like MIT's Project MAC and SAIL, and is still highly relevant in academic and theoretical computer science despite the subsequent emergence of many other highly functional research languages. That many of these venerable research institutions have vanished or declined, their faculties having split up or moved into the private sector, and the advanced and demanding course-work taught there using Lisp having been replaced by courses based around teaching languages-of-the-day (such as Java, Python, Ruby, and even JavaScript for web design) in a series of so-called AI Winters is a widely remarked upon feature of history. To many this conjures a nostalgic impression of the halcyon days of advanced computer research when funding for blue-sky exploratory coding was plentiful and most of the features of the contemporary digital world were first thought up and made real by wizardly hackers (the well-known purple cover of one venerated Lisp textbook is especially evocative, featuring a renaissance woodcut illustration of a sorcerous natural philosopher conjuring up magic with Lisp symbols superimposed into the image).  Throughout all this, Lisp, one of the first and greatest successes of theoretical computer science, has persisted, still in general though no-longer-universal use within the warrens of programming language and computability research, still studied by handfuls of students interested in something more than simply getting a job as a code grinder for Big Data, its features still inspiring generations of new language designers and implementers to do better (Ruby was designed — according to his admission — by Matsumoto Yukihiro as ""a bad rip-off of Lisp"" that would be ""nicer to ordinary people""; Java 8 introduced lambdas — in 2014!). David Thornley even noted that whether or not Lisp was a ""dead"" or moribund programming language is, in fact, a question older than almost all programming languages, and has been for decades.  The third panel references Star Wars. The ""old wizard"" Obi-Wan Kenobi, who remembers the culture and sophistication of the Old Republic (""Before the dark times. Before the Empire."") and lives as a hermit in the desert at the beginning of the film spoke these lines when passing on a lightsaber to Luke Skywalker:  The title text is also a reference to Star Wars lines:  The MIT mentioned in the title text is, of course, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an institution fundamental to the development of Lisp (and Scheme, which is a dialect of Lisp). For about 20 years, MIT taught Scheme in its introductory computer science course, 6.001 — Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (that course has since been replaced with a course teaching Python).","[Cueball is sitting at a computer, and Megan is standing behind the desk.] Cueball: Lisp is over half a century old and it still has this perfect, timeless air about it. Cueball: I wonder if the cycles will continue forever. A few coders from each new generation rediscovering the Lisp arts.

303: Compiling,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/303:_Compiling,programming,"Are you stealing those LCDs?' 'Yeah, but I'm doing it while my code compiles.'","Computer programming involves writing instructions for a computer to follow, in a specific programming language, which is largely human readable and writable, at least to programmers who understand that language.  However, for the computers to follow instructions, they need to be given machine code — the actual ""language"" that computers ""speak"" and one that can be written directly with the correct tools, but would be too tedious and error-prone for just about any practical modern project where alternatives exist, where anything more than a Hello World could be awkward to implement straight into machine-code.  Conversion from the more conveniently human-writable code into computer-executable files is performed by interpreters or compilers.  Interpreters (e.g. that for PHP for one example) generally read through the code, or script, each line at a time as and when required, and has to do a lot of work with various processing overheads and the risk of hitting an invalid instruction or mistake in syntax that it can't handle.  It also requires that a relevant version of the interpreter exist on any machine that has to run the script and perhaps some additional knowledge by the end-user.  For widely distributed (and especially commercial) programs, some form of compilation will instead be used.  Compiling may have just one computer system read through the man-written code and (barring errors) produces the equivalent stand-alone and direct machine-readable code, suitable for a given range of computers.  This process might involve several passes to check for 'obvious' errors in the code, as well as converting some programming concepts that are easiest for humans to understand into equivalent concepts that may be far easier for the computer to work with.  As such, compiling takes a certain amount of time at the time of production.  Depending on the size of the project and the power of the computer doing the compilation, it may measure in hours, but at least only needs to be repeated if an untrapped error needs fixing or additional features added in at a later date.  As of 2015 the Linux Kernel contains over 19 million lines of code, arguably a massive job for any compiler, but if done correctly it saves time for all the people who will ultimately be using its output.  Thus, when Cueball is caught wasting time at work, he argues that such activities are not worse than any other possible ones, at this moment.  If his job is writing code and compiling it, then there may be nothing else that he can do right now.  He cannot usefully tweak the code before it finishes compiling and the expected result checked.  The title text takes this a step further.  Cueball claims that all activities are equally benign while the code is compiling — and that includes committing illegal acts, such as stealing LCDs.  Nine years after this comic was released Randall made a comic called 1755: Old Days about how compiling worked in the old days. It was Cueball who asked. The next comic after that, 1756: I'm With Her, was released the Monday before the 2016 United States presidential election. And in that comic a Cueball with a sword on an office chair like in this comic is featured. Seems realistic that Randall had that politically loaded comic ready for some time, and when finding and deciding to use this old version of Cueball, he may have gotten inspired by the compiling theme to make Old Days.","The #1 Programmer Excuse for Legitimately Slacking Off: ""My code's compiling."" [Two programmers are sword-fighting on office chairs in a hallway. An unseen manager calls them back to work through an open office door.] Manager: Hey! Get back to work! Cueball: Compiling!

312: With Apologies to Robert Frost,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/312:_With_Apologies_to_Robert_Frost,programming,Some say the world will end in fire; some say in segfaults.,"This comic presents a poem about a god's dilemma of whether to create the world using Perl or Lisp, two popular computer programming languages. The god has chosen to write it in Perl but since then appears to lament the choice, apparently expressing that if given the chance to write the world's code again, he or she or it would use Lisp instead.  The implication is that a universe created by Lisp would look better under close examination, the 'founding myth' referred to in the poem.  Instead of an incomprehensible big bang, inflation, dark matter and dark energy, the elegance of Lisp may have led to more elegantly framed laws of nature.  The grammar of Lisp as a language requires the programmer to use a multitude of parentheses, and in many cases it can be difficult to determine whether all of the parentheses have been properly matched up to one another. The last two lines of the poem refer to the plentiful parentheses in Lisp, and the image at the bottom of the panel shows a close-parenthesis at the supposed end of the Universe.  A segmentation fault, also commonly called a segfault, is an error that occurs when a computer program attempts to access computer memory to which it should not have access.  This is a fatal error that will cause the program to stop executing.  This comic deals with similar subject matter to 224: Lisp, in which one of ""the gods"" claims that although the Universe may appear to have been written in Lisp, it was actually written mostly using Perl.  The poem itself and the title text are a parody of ""Fire and Ice,"" written by the American poet Robert Frost and first published in 1920. In this poem, the speaker discusses his stance in the debate on whether the world will be destroyed in fire or in ice. ""A God's Lament"" has a rhyme scheme that is nearly identical to that of Frost's poem. However, it differs in that ""Lisp"" does not rhyme with ""men,"" ""again,"" and ""paren,"" while the corresponding four lines in Frost's poem do rhyme.","A God's Lament Some said the world should be in Perl; Some said in Lisp. Now, having given both a whirl, I held with those who favored Perl. But I fear we passed to men A disappointing founding myth, And should we write it all again, I'd end it with A close-paren.  )"
323: Ballmer Peak,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/323:_Ballmer_Peak,programming,Apple uses automated schnapps IVs.,"This comic is about alcohol and programming ability. Programmers sometimes have a reputation for drinking habits, and programmer gatherings (such as hackfests) tend to offer copious amounts of alcohol. More generally, intoxicated programmers can get the impression that, by being a little disconnected from physical reality, they become more efficient at their programming. The comic is a take on this belief, with two references:  The curve in the comic suggests that, while generally decreasing with alcohol intoxication, at just the right level the skill of a programmer gets terrific indeed. Randall named the peak after Steve Ballmer, as if discovered by him; this references the analogously named Balmer peaks (with one 'L'), and the idea that Steve Ballmer makes for an easy association of programming and alcohol. The peak of the curve occurs at a BAC of 0.1337%, which is a reference to leet. (See this interview with Randall).  The end of the comic turns the whole idea into a sideways jab at Windows ME, a version of Microsoft Windows often criticized for being buggy, slow and unstable: it suggests that ME was developed by programmers completely drunk, because their managers wanted to exploit this ""Ballmer peak"", but did so without any precaution. That idea fit well the result of a buggy and unstable product.  On the contrary, the title text claims that Apple uses this effect with careful calibration, by delivering precise quantities of alcohol (schnapps) to its programmers via intravenous therapy (IV).  An actual research paper published in March 2012 showed that the situation described in this comic is not far from reality. Researchers found that intoxicated participants performed better than sober participants on a test that evaluates creative problem solving skills, and were also more likely to evaluate their own solutions as insightful. However, the actual reported peak was 0.075%, not between 0.129% and 0.138% as displayed in the comic.  In the above-mentioned speech at Google, Randall Munroe explained that he tried to experiment on himself about the relationship between alcohol intoxication and intellectual skills, by solving a Rubik's Cube repeatedly while getting more and more drunk. He eventually found that he could get deeply drunk without degrading very much his performance at solving the puzzle (contrary to, for instance, finding and picking up the Cube which became something of a problem towards the end). He suggested that the Rubik's Cube wasn't a good test to study this relationship, the cube probably being solved with muscle memory rather than real intellectual skills.","[A graph with ""programming skill"" on the Y-axis and ""blood alcohol concentration"" on the X one.] [Cueball is making a presentation with the graph.] Cueball: Called the Ballmer Peak, it was discovered by Microsoft in the 80's. The cause is unknown but somehow a B.A.C between 0.129% and 0.138% confers superhuman programming ability. Cueball: However, it's a delicate effect requiring careful calibration – you can't just give a team of coders a year's supply of whiskey and tell them to get cracking. Spectator: ...Has that ever happened? Cueball: Remember Windows ME? Spectator: I knew it!"
327: Exploits of a Mom,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/327:_Exploits_of_a_Mom,programming,Her daughter is named Help I'm trapped in a driver's license factory.,"Mrs. Roberts receives a call from her son's school. The caller, likely one of the school's administrators, asks if she really named her son Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--, a rather unusual name.[citation needed] Perhaps surprisingly, Mrs. Roberts responds in the affirmative, claiming that she uses the nickname ""Little Bobby Tables"". As the full name is read into the school's system's databases without data sanitization, it causes the student table in the database to be deleted.  The title of this comic is a pun. Exploit can mean an accomplishment or heroic deed, but in computer science the term refers to a program or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability in other software. In fact, one could say that her exploit is to exploit an exploit (her achievement is to make use of a vulnerability). The title can also refer to her choice of name for her son, which is rather extraordinary.  In SQL, a database programming language, commands are separated by semicolons ; and strings of text are often delimited using single quotes '. Parts of commands may also be enclosed in parentheses ( and ).  Data entries are stored as ""rows"" within named ""tables"" of similar items (e.g. Students).  The command to delete an entire table (and every row of data in that table) is DROP TABLE, as in DROP TABLE Students;.  The exploited vulnerability here is that the single quote in the name input was not correctly ""escaped"" by the software. That is, if a student's name did indeed contain a quote mark, it should have been parsed as one of the characters making up the text string and not as the marker to close the string, which it erroneously was. Lack of such escaping is a common SQL vulnerability; this type of exploit is referred to as SQL injection. Mrs. Roberts thus reminds the school to make sure they have added data filtering code to prevent code injection exploits in the future.  For example, to add information about Elaine to a data table called 'Students' the SQL query could be: INSERT INTO Students (firstname) VALUES ('Elaine');   However, using the odd name Robert');DROP TABLE Students;--  where we used ""Elaine"" above, the SQL query becomes: INSERT INTO Students (firstname) VALUES ('Robert');DROP TABLE Students;-- ');   By insertion of the two semi-colons in the odd name this is now three well formed SQL commands:  INSERT INTO Students (firstname) VALUES ('Robert');  DROP TABLE Students;  -- ');","[Mrs. Roberts receives a call from her son's school on her wireless phone. She is standing with a cup of hot coffee or tea (shown with a small line above the cup) facing a small round three-legged table to the right.

353: Python,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/353:_Python,programming,"I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday. It was wonderful. Perl, I'm leaving you.","Python is a programming language designed specifically to make it easy to write clear, readable programs. Flying is often used as a metaphor for freedom and ease, and here Randall shows Cueball literally flying in response to using Python.  A ""Hello, World!"" program is a very simple program that prints the phrase ""Hello, World!"", used in textbooks to illustrate a given programming language. While this sounds simple, it can be nontrivial in some programming languages where you need to explicitly import a library that contains the print function (for instance, in C you need to begin with #include <stdio.h>) or do complicated things with classes and variables (see the Java ""Hello, World!"" for one example). Python doesn't need any of that: print ""Hello, world!"" (or in Python 3.0, print(""Hello, world!"")) really is all you need to do.  Dynamic typing and significant whitespace are two controversial features of Python, which make some people—like Cueball's friend—hesitant to use the language.  Dynamic typing means that variables do not have types (like ""list of short integers"" or ""a bunch of letters""); any value of any type can be placed in any variable. Dynamic typing allows for more flexible languages, but it means that certain kinds of errors (like trying to subtract a letter from a number) can't be caught until a program is run, and some people think this is too dangerous for the tradeoff to be acceptable.  Whitespace is a string of invisible text characters, like spaces or tabs. In programming, blocks of code controlled by a statement are usually indented under that statement. Most languages require you to use braces ({…}) or special keywords (BEGIN…END) to delimit these blocks; in Python, the indentation itself is the delimiter. Many Python programmers find that this makes code more readable, but many other programmers find it too ""magical"" and don't trust it.  Classes, functions and constants in Python are packed into modules. To use a module, you write ""import module"" at the top of your source file. Python comes with a very powerful standard library of modules to do everything from parsing XML to comparing two sets of files for differences, and new modules can be easily installed from the PyPI repository, which has more than 79,000 more to choose from (as of April 2016). Cueball can fly because he imported the antigravity module. Python still works for Cueball in 482: Height.  In the final panel, Cueball admits that his ability to fly may actually be because he has ""sampled everything in the medicine cabinet"", though he's sure it is the Python anyway. An implication of this is that ingesting everything in the medicine cabinet has given him the feeling of freedom and ease that ""flying"" represents - or that he is hallucinating himself flying and having a conversation with the other character about it. Here, the metaphor of ""feeling like you're flying"" while using Python is transformed back from being literal (Cueball is actually flying) to being metaphorical (Randall feels like he is flying because Python is so easy to use... or because he had too many strange drugs).  Perl, mentioned in the title text, is another programming language with the same target audience as Python, as both are high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. However they strongly oppose each other in their language design:  Since he has discovered Python Randall doesn't like Perl anymore, probably because its syntax is less consistent.","[A Friend is talking to Cueball, who is floating in the sky.] Friend: You're flying! How? Cueball: Python! Cueball: I learned it last night! Everything is so simple! Cueball: Hello world is just 'print ""Hello, World!""' Friend: I dunno... Dynamic typing? Whitespace? Cueball: Come join us! Programming is fun again! It's a whole new world up here! Friend: But how are you flying? Cueball: I just typed 'import antigravity' Friend: That's it? Cueball: ...I also sampled everything in the medicine cabinet for comparison. Cueball: But I think this is the python."
371: Compiler Complaint,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/371:_Compiler_Complaint,programming,Checking whether build environment is sane... build environment is grinning and holding a spatula. Guess not.,"A compiler is a program that converts code into machine instructions that a computer can run. A Pointer is a variable within a computer program that is used to reference a memory location. A Segmentation Fault (segfault) is an error that occurs when a program attempts to access an invalid section of memory. Segfaults usually cause a program to crash in an ungraceful fashion and fixing them can be difficult. Contrary to the comic title, segfaults occur during Run time (program lifecycle phase) and as such are not associated with a compiler.  In the comic, the computer starts talking to Cueball and compares a segfault with the unpleasant feeling one gets when they experience a hypnic jerk. The computer then tells the programmer to ""double-check your damn pointers,"" as segfaults usually arise from a program attempting to access memory that is referenced by an invalid pointer.  The title-text references GNU-style autoconf configuration scripts. These scripts check certain features of the system they're running on in order to build a program correctly; for example, certain systems expect system calls to occur in a specific way, and the autoconf script will detect this and alter the program to match the expectation. Invariably (and memetically), these scripts include a check to determine ""whether the build environment is sane."" This actually checks whether the path to the current folder has ""unsafe"" characters, and whether a newly created file is older than the script itself, which could indicate a very esoteric filesystem, a corrupted source archive, or just a system clock that's set incorrectly; however, since these file modification dates are an important part of how the autoconf script does its work, it can't go any further in an ""insane"" environment. In any case, the joke is that an insane build environment is nothing like an insane person, yet Randall is equating the two.","[Cueball sits at a computer, hand over the keyboard.] Computer: Okay, human. Cueball: Huh? Computer: Before you hit ""compile,"" listen up.  Computer: You know when you're falling asleep, and you imagine yourself walking or something, and suddenly you misstep, stumble, and jolt awake? Cueball: Yeah!  Computer: Well, that's what a segfault feels like.  Computer: Double-check your damn pointers, okay?"

Cueball has clearly misused the system date in some way (possibly by square rooting the timestamp with the assumption that 0 is 12:00:00 on Jan 1st, 0 CE, which would require the use of imaginary numbers and would mean his output would probably be wrong anyway,), his friend makes a pun by combining ""Epoch"" with ""Epic Fail"" - a colloquial term meaning ""a very big mistake was made"".  The title text takes the joke to the next level, claiming that the entire universe began when Unix did, and therefore no one can be older than 38 at the time of the release of this comic, 2008. This would now be 47 as of 2017 (the formula is 'x - 1970', where x is the current year), which would explain the bug since no earlier dates would be needed. This is also similar to Last Thursdayism.","[Cueball sits at a computer, staring at the screen and rubbing his chin in thought. A friend stands behind him.] Cueball: Weird — My code's crashing when given pre-1970 dates. Friend [pointing at Cueball and his computer]: Epoch fail!"
378: Real Programmers,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/378:_Real_Programmers,programming,Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.,"This comic is a satire on the idea of a Real Programmer. To quote Wikipedia ""...the computer folklore term Real Programmer has come to describe the archetypical 'hardcore' programmer who eschews the modern languages and tools of the day in favour of more direct and efficient solutions—closer to the hardware."" The implication is that modern programmers are coddled by today's tools of the trade, which eschew detailed understanding for simple workflows.  The first figure is writing a piece of code when another programmer ridicules him for using GNU nano. Nano is a text editor - a program often used to edit the source code of other programs; it is modern, simple, and easy-to-use. He goes on to say that ""REAL"" programmers use Emacs. GNU Emacs is a popular editor known for its vast profusion of features and extensions to perform all sorts of functions beyond simple text editing, and is widely regarded as one of the best examples of software. The comic continues from here as a series of programmers state progressively more obscure or outdated methods. Culminating in the final programmer who claims that ""real"" programmers use butterflies.  His description of his rather surreal programming method is ludicrously complicated and would require an absurd amount of knowledge and forethought to pull off, bordering on omniscience. In the final panel the Emacs programmer claims that there's an Emacs code to do that.  Emacs and Vim are both text editors. ed is a line editor. These represent progressively more ""old school"" solutions to the problem of editing code. cat is a Unix program that concatenates and outputs the contents of files; and it's usually run from a Unix shell, which allows its output to be written or appended to a file.  Using a magnetised needle to flip bits on a hard drive requires nanometric precision and intuitive mastery of binary code, but in the early days of programming people did use needles sometimes to fix bugs on Punched cards.  When final character suggests the utterly surreal idea of using butterflies he is referring to the Butterfly effect, a ""phenomenon whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome"". The joke at this point relies on stretching the connection between the ideas of ""difficult-to-use"" and ""requires detailed understanding of underlying principles"", to suggest that not only do Real Programmers know everything about how computers work, but they know how to manipulate the ambient physical environment in elaborate ways to cause computers to do what they want, akin to performing trick shots that accomplish feats of programming.  The fact that Emacs already has a command for this simply exasperates the programmers frustration with modern programming tools.  GNU Emacs succeeds despite being riddled with featuritis.  Emacs commands are usually referred to by the key sequence required to activate them, such as ""C-x M-c"" (Control-x Meta-c, though this exact key sequence is a bit different from most Emacs commands). The macro referenced is a pun on the play/movie titled ""M. Butterfly"". The butterfly programmer saying ""Dammit, Emacs"" plays on Emacs' notoriety for its kitchen sink design approach of tossing in all the features and options that anybody might ever conceivably want. By way of example, later versions of Emacs actually added a totally useless ""M-x butterfly"" command as an easter egg, in reference to this very comic: see the YouTube demo and screenr demo.  The title text further suggests manipulating the universal constants in order to create a universe in which the required computer data will exist. Programming of this sort would require power and knowledge akin to the Abrahamic God.  According to the logic, the programmers shown may even represent the fulfillment of this master programmers plan. The universe may have been designed in such a way that the programmers ancestry would result in his parents, who would meet and have a child, who would learn programming and eventually find himself in a position where he undertakes the task of creating a program, which fills the disk with the desired data. In tandem, of course, all of the people involved with creating and developing all the required hardware, software, raw materials, computer science, electricity, logic (etc., etc., etc.) would have to be part of the master plan. Put simply, it would probably be simpler just to use Emacs.   The use of a magnetized needle may also be a reference to the Apollo AGC guidance computer, whose instructions were physically written as patterns of wires looped around or through cylindrical magnets in order to record binary code.  This comic hints at the ""editor wars"", an ongoing debate of Vim and Emacs users over which of the two editors is the best. The editor wars are mentioned again in 1823: Hottest Editors.","[A Cueball like man sits at a computer, programming. Cueball stands behind him and looks over his shoulder.] Cueball: nano?

379: Forgetting,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/379:_Forgetting,programming,"Of course, the assert doesn't work.","Cueball is writing a piece of code (probably in the programming language C++) which removes an item from a data structure called a Linked list (the first two lines of the text). Then, he writes a comment (which is delimited by the double slashes) relating the code to his personal life. Finally, he adds an assertion, which is normally a formal specification of a condition which should always be true (with which the programmer ensures that e.g. mass is not negative). But in this case, instead of asserting a software-related predicate, he asserts that ""it's going to be okay"" - and because of how string literals are treated by the interpreter, the assertion will be true.  An ""assert"" is a programming statement that allows you to insert sanity checks into your code. For example, if you were writing a program to calculate the speed of a neutrino, then at the end of the calculation you could say:    If the assertion fails, then the program will stop with an error. This would be much better than publishing an embarrassing paper, for example.   As stated previously, Cueball is removing an item from a linked list. This will essentially delete, or make the computer ""forget"" about the item. Cueball realizes that he cannot forget this emotional event through the use of two commands as he can with a computer, which only makes him feel depressed about an unsaid event, the item -- in a sense -- which cannot be removed.   He writes two comments further clarifying his sense of hopelessness over this event, followed by an assertion that ""it will be okay"", something which has nothing to do with the code he is writing.  The title text explains that assertion in question fails: we cannot be sure that things are going to be ok.","[Cueball sits at computer, coding.]  Cueball: <sniff>  [Cueball lowers his head into his hands and cries.]  [Cueball types again.]"
407: Cheap GPS,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/407:_Cheap_GPS,programming,"In lieu of mapping software, I once wrote a Perl program which, given a USB GPS receiver and a destination, printed 'LEFT' 'RIGHT' OR 'STRAIGHT' based on my heading.","GPS is a system allowing people to find their location and speed on Earth. It was first developed for the U.S. military, but now it sees international usage for everyday navigation. Many motorists today have GPS devices (sometimes just called GPS's) that can give driving directions electronically.  ""Hot and Cold"" is a children's activity/game where one person searches for an object they don't know what it is, and the rest must respond ""Hot"" or ""Cold."" Other words, such as ""warm"" and ""cool"" can be used to describe their distance more accurately. The closer the player is to the mystery, the ""hotter"" they are.  The series of instructions spoken (""cold"", ""warm"", ""hot"", then ""cold"" again) suggests that Cueball either missed a turn, or that he just passed his destination.  Randall describes a past engineering project of his that can only describe turns ""as the crow flies."" So, for example, if he was driving north with the destination to the northeast, the GPS would tell him to turn right even if no such turn was legally possible. Perhaps not very functional, but it is a pretty cool thing to build.","[Cueball driving down the road, with a GPS reading ""COLD"".] GPS: COLD... WARM... HOT! COLD..."
409: Electric Skateboard (Double Comic),http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/409:_Electric_Skateboard_(Double_Comic),programming,"Unsafe vehicles, hills, and philosophy go hand in hand.","This comic is an affectionate parody of Calvin and Hobbes, a newspaper comic drawn by Bill Watterson that ran for ten years from November 1985 to December 1995. Calvin and Hobbes follows the daily life of a rambunctious, precocious six-year-old named Calvin and his sarcastic stuffed tiger Hobbes. The artwork in the second strip is distinctly Wattersonian as well. This comic could be referencing the typical Sunday strip format of having a top line of ""throwaway panels"" that had a one-off gag before the rest of the strip, which was more detailed. This was an effect of Sunday strip formatting in newspapers, where individual newspaper often lopped off the the top one-third of the comic to save space. Thus, strip creators had to use the top panels on throwaway gags or else the readers of a space-saving newspaper would be missing key parts of the strip.  Calvin and Hobbes is also referenced in 529: Sledding Discussion.  Randall has a special fascination with motorized skateboards. A longboard is a skateboard that is longer, and is used for downhill races, and skating through less urban areas (college campuses, for example).  Mario Kart is a game for Nintendo game consoles that allows four players to race each other while having good spirited fun like at 290: Fucking Blue Shells while throwing items at each other. The objects in the fourth panel are Koopa Troopa shells, items in the game. They can be thrown like projectiles to crash into foes, green in a straight line, red homing onto racer in front.  Calvin and Hobbes frequently involves heavy philosophical discussions. In one recurring theme, they ride down a dangerous hill in a red wagon or tobbogan while discussing the nature of morality, usually ending in a crash (examples [1] [2] [3]). This comic inverts that by having Cueball and Megan go uphill while discussing philosophy. Naturally, they collide with Calvin and Hobbes' wagon - which prompts the title text.  Cueball uses the C and Python programming languages as analogies for their ride. In general, Python is easier than C, and abstracts a lot of C's hairier features (""boring parts,"" as Randall calls them). Moving from C to Python is quite a freeing experience; programmers no longer have to worry about pointers, and memory allocation, and just lets the code flow through the programmer until they are one with the Force. Erm, computer. Although it seems - before the crash - that the idea that, programming in C (and skating without electricity) builds character, is about to be explored philosophically (building character is also a recurring theme in Calvin and Hobbes, as documented delightfully in the Calvin and Hobbes wiki).  Electric skateboards have been the subject of several other comics like 139: I Have Owned Two Electric Skateboards, a panel in 442: xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel and the entire The Race five part comic series.","[Cueball showing off electric skateboard to girl reading something.] Cueball: Check it out!

413: New Pet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/413:_New_Pet,programming,ONE LAPTOP PER HAMSTER!,"Megan and Cueball create a new pet by putting an Eee PC into a hamster ball, allowing it to roll around.  The Asus Eee PC was one of the first subnotebook computers available on the American market, noted for its small size and coming pre-installed with Linux. With a diagonal size of 11 inches, it would take a big hamster ball to carry it like this.  Omniwheels are wheels with rollers mounted on the edge to allow the wheel to slide sideways. The wheels in the drawing look more like Mecanum wheels, which have rollers mounted at an angle to the edge. Both Omniwheels and Mecanum wheels are used in omni-directional drive systems, like you would use to drive a hamster ball from the inside. A webcam is connected magnetically to the top of the hamster ball, which connects to an rf link to transmit wirelessly to the computer.  TCO is total cost of ownership, which is exactly what it sounds like: the purchase price of something, plus all costs of keeping, operating, and/or maintaining that something. It's used in accounting to determine something's true cost-to-value evaluation. In the case of a cat, TCO would primarily consist of food, litter, veterinary care, etc. Refer to trivia for more details. For the device in the comic, there would be a small ongoing cost (occasional recharges for the batteries) after the initial investment.  A Roomba is a self-directed robotic vacuum cleaner made by iRobot.  Python is a programming language popular among geeks running Linux. Among other features, it has a large number of easily installed 3rd-party libraries which make it easy to add features to programs. In this case, Cueball is importing the ""soul"" library to give the new pet a soul – obviously something that a programming language cannot actually do. This is a reference to 353: Python.  The title text refers to the One Laptop per Child project spearheaded by Nicholas Negroponte around 2005, with the goal of building an inexpensive, durable sublaptop that could be distributed to children in developing countries to give them an educational edge.","[Megan is placing EEE PC inside hamster ball.

424: Security Holes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/424:_Security_Holes,programming,True story: I had to try several times to upload this comic because my ssh key was blacklisted.,"The ""Debian-OpenSSL fiasco"" was a major security problem discovered in the Debian Linux distribution and its version of the cryptographic library called OpenSSL. With just a tiny change in the software, which was intended to have no effect on security, its random number generator was completely crippled, as was the security of all cryptographic keys generated by the system. The problem was created when a Debian developer removed one line of code which was crucial, even though it could seem like it did nothing useful. More detail about the fiasco: Crippling Crypto: The Debian OpenSSL Debacle, Debian's information page about the problem.  The title text refers also to this issue: After the security problem was found, all cryptographic keys generated or used on the broken operating system needed to be replaced. Many systems introduced special checks for such weak keys, adding the keys to blacklists, thereby preventing their use and forcing users to create new keys. Randall claims he was affected by that when uploading this comic to the server.  The comics on the left presents Cueball as a programmer who, on a whim, removes pieces of code (commenting out the code by prepending the line with two slashes), presumably thinking they are not necessary. The first removed line, MD_update(&m, buf, j); is the exact piece of code which was removed in the Debian fiasco. The next panels show him commenting out fictitious lines of code apparently preventing bad things from happening.  The other part of the comic lists ""security problems"" which were allegedly discovered in other Linux variants afterwards:  Cryptographic software in Fedora Core was allegedly not secure against toy decoder rings.   Xandros (used in Asus Eee PC netbooks) gave superuser privileges to anybody ""if asked in a stern voice"". This is likely a reference to fact that the preinstalled Xandros OS did not require a password for root privileges by default.  Gentoo would succumb to flattery, which may be a reference to Gentoo's notorious difficulty to manage. Any user who is capable of understanding it, might have a large ego, and therefore be susceptible to flattery.  OLPC OS could have been attacked using Jeff Goldblum's laptop computer, which refers to a scene in the Independence Day movie, where Jeff Goldblum's character was able to hack into an alien spaceship using his Apple PowerBook computer - which is a topic of great contempt by geeks who point to the absurdity of such a construction.  Slackware gave superuser privileges to anybody who ""says Elvish word for 'friend'"", which refers to a scene in The Lord of the Rings, where the entrance door to Moria could have been opened using a password mellon, the Elvish word for ""friend"", as indicated on the door itself.  And Ubuntu, which is another Linux distribution, was allegedly found to be actually Windows Vista, the latest version of Microsoft Windows at this time in 2008. This may be a reference to Ubuntu being developed with non-advanced users in mind, with many fail-safes and additional features being turned on by default, which had more in common with Windows than any other Linux-based operating system at the time.","[Cueball sitting at computer.] Cueball: I'll just comment out these lines...  // MD_update(&m, buf, j);  // do_not_crash();  // prevent_911();  In the rush to clean up the debian-openssl fiasco, a number of other major security holes have been uncovered:    Affected system   Security problem   Fedora Core   Vulnerable to certain decoder rings   Xandros (EEE PC)   Gives root access if asked in a stern voice   Gentoo   Vulnerable to flattery   OLPC OS   Vulnerable to Jeff Goldblum's Powerbook   Slackware   Gives root access if user says Elvish word for ""friend""   Ubuntu   Turns out distro is actually just Windows Vista with a few custom Themes"
482: Height,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/482:_Height,programming,"Interestingly, on a true vertical log plot, I think the Eiffel Tower's sides would really be straight lines.","Height uses a logarithmic scale to depict the contents of the universe at progressively smaller distances from Earth (less high above the Earth), starting at the highest possible ""point"", the edge of the observable universe, going all the way down to the grass beneath our feet. The comic is a direct companion piece to 485: Depth, also released on a Monday the week after this one. Depth similarly uses the logarithmic scale to depict the Earth at progressively greater magnification (going ""deeper"" down), from Earth's surface (the grass) to the interior of a single proton. At the very top the top (edge) of the observable universe is described as being 46 billion light years above the Earth. The universe is ""only"" about 13.8 billion years old, so the cosmic background radiation that reaches the Earth today, has also only traveled 13.8 billion light years. However, during that time the universe has expanded, so the galaxies that formed from that spot where this background radiation was emitted 13.8 billion years ago, would now be 46 billion light years away. This has lead to many misconceptions regarding the size the most typical being that the radius of the observable universe is ""only"" 13.8 billion light years. See this video, How Do You Measure the Size of the Universe? for a great explanation of the 46 billion light years. To the right of the text, Black Hat stands atop the comic, having just dropped a cat off the edge head first; he is clearly going to test if the cat will land on its feet, being a jerk per his usual character. It will take some time though, before the cat reaches Earth... As one scrolls down, the depicted distances become less compressed, until arriving at the surface of Earth, all the while approaching a 1:1 scale with real-life distances. As shown in 1162: Log Scale, if Randall didn't do this, the comic would be much, MUCH longer. In this comic, most objects that are grounded on Earth are scaled logarithmically on the vertical axes and linearly on the horizontal axes (some are scaled linearly on both axes). Displaying objects in this manner noticeably distorts their shape; the Great Pyramid, for instance, looks not like a pyramid but like a bullet. Outside of the Earth's atmosphere, the objects are placed at their actual distances from Earth on the log scale, but their shapes are not subjected to the logarithmic scaling of Earth objects, instead appearing as they would be seen (otherwise, round objects like the sun would appear more egg shaped, with the flatter side facing upward). However, objects are still much larger or much smaller than they would be in real life, in order to allow them to be properly seen. In the title text, Randall muses on how the inwardly-curved sides of the Eiffel Tower might actually become perfectly straightened when subjected to this logarithmic distortion, although it is shown to bulge in the comic proper, meaning Randall probably doesn't fully believe his own musings. The actual shape of the Tower approximates an exponential curve, which would indeed give a straight line on a log scale, although it was actually designed by Gustave Eiffel to minimize wind resistance rather than to be mathematically exact (the design is so perfect that the amount the Tower sways in the wind is less than the amount it is distorted due to thermal expansion of the sunlit side).

505: A Bunch of Rocks,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/505:_A_Bunch_of_Rocks,programming,I call Rule 34 on Wolfram's Rule 34.,"Cueball awakens to find himself trapped for eternity in an endless expanse of sand and rocks. At first, he uses this time to derive all of mathematics and physics, including quantum mechanics and general relativity. Next Cueball creates a computer that can process any possible function, out of rocks and rules for the interaction between rocks. He then simulates a particle followed by the interactions between particles, followed by the entire universe. The amount of time it takes to simulate the change in the universe from one instant to the next takes an extremely long time as the time it takes to update just one row of rocks can be measured in googols of years, assuming a realistic time to place each rock.  Cueball then apologizes for any flaws we see in the simulation. This implies that the audience is living in Cueball's simulation, making Cueball essentially God.  The final frame cuts to a classroom where a bored student stares at his hands waiting for class to end. Cueball admonishes the student for thinking that class is lasting forever. The joke being that the boredom felt in a classroom is nothing compared to the boredom that inspires Cueball to spend his time toiling to keep the universe moving. Indeed, the minutes of lecture actually took many ""billions and billions of millennia"" for Cueball to simulate.  The title text suggests that Rule 34 should be called on Wolfram's Rule 34. Rule 34 (see 305: Rule 34) is a humorous rule of the Internet which states ""If you can imagine it, there is porn of it. No exceptions."" Wolfram's Rule 34 is a cellular automaton. Therefore, the title text says that someone has made pornography featuring the cellular automaton in question.  The three diagrams in the ""Physics, too. I worked out the kinks..."" panel are, from left to right:  The graph that represents particle interaction is a Feynman Diagram. This shows the interaction of subatomic particles that collide and exchange some momentum via a photon. The slope of the middle line represents the distance moved and the time lost/gained during the interaction.  The Swiss patent office line refers to Albert Einstein, who was employed as a Swiss patent clerk while coming up with his theory of special relativity. This joke is also referenced in 1067: Pressures.  Also, there is a standing joke that very few important inventions have come from Switzerland, since the country hadn't been involved in the world wars, and thus has not been part of the weapons race, nor was it a driving force in the preceding Industrial Revolution.  In the center of the comic, the binary numbers pointing to the particle are both 42. This is a reference to the comedic answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything from the The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.  Cueball mentions that if we see an artifact flutter in and out of reality he must have made a mistake in the last ""billions and billions of millennia.""  This implies that the small period of time the artifact is present in his time is much longer than our universe has existed. That is a very long time. However, because it was a really long time, the difference would be more than just a small mote of dust disappearing.  Cueball uses the rocks to build a cellular automaton, a computational model based on simple rules to advance from one state to the next. Certain cellular automata are Turing-complete, which means that they can be used to represent any conceivable algorithm if expanded infinitely. He specifically seems to be running Wolfram's Rule 110, which is capable of universal computation. When using Rule 110 for universal computation, one builds a background pattern, which can be seen in the comic as the pattern of smaller triangles, and then performs computation by sending out ""rockets"" to collide and interact with each other.","[Cueball is standing in a desert with lots of rocks lying around.

518: Flow Charts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/518:_Flow_Charts,programming,"At 8 drinks, you switch the torrent from FreeBSD to Microsoft Bob. C'mon, it'll be fun!","Flowcharts are diagrams that represent processes in a graphical form. While predominantly used in computer programming to visualize the structure of source code, flowcharts can in theory be used to depict any real or virtual procedure. In this comic, this idea is subverted by employing a flowchart to explain how flowcharts work. Flowcharts are a recurring theme on xkcd, and a list of flowchart comics can be found here.  This seems like a faulty basis for explaining anything, but the basic functionality of flowcharts is quite intuitive, and the attempted self-description is almost unnecessary. In fact, the comic does not actually explain how to use the flowchart: it just uses an example of a very simple flowchart to demonstrate to the reader that they can easily work out how to follow it.  If the reader attempts to ""game"" the system by either giving contradictory answers, or refusing to acknowledge that they can see the ""Yes"" and ""No"" labels, the flowchart gets confused or becomes abusive.  Just like a real computer.  If you confirm or demonstrate that you can follow the flowchart, it inevitably leads to the ""Let's go drink"" box, which gives rise to the assumption that the whole chart was only a pretence for drinking.  FreeBSD is a unixoid operating system for computers which is generally considered to require advanced skills. The question whether Linux or (Free)BSD is the preferable operating system is a question of almost religious belief to some. The comic takes a shot against FreeBSD by implying that one would only decide to install it when under the influence of alcohol. This may also be a reference to 349: Success.  The title text mentions Microsoft Bob, a software package published in 1995 by Microsoft. The product was targeted towards beginners, and Microsoft decided to use a cartoon-style interface instead of a more 'professional' environment. It was a commercial failure, and still serves as an inside joke among IT professionals.  Randall has made use of flowcharts before and later he released another comic name 1195: Flowchart.","[A flow chart is shown beneath a caption.

The first two bars on the chart are 900 hours of class, which is about 180 hours short of how many hours kids spend in school each year (most likely to show the lunch hour), and 400 hours of homework, or an average of about 2.2 hours per school day. Conversely, idly messing around in Perl (a programming language) for only one weekend is shown to have a much larger impact on one's future — specifically Randall's, as learning how to code would have been key to his job as a robotics engineer at NASA. This is likely due to the skills one can pick up in even just a single weekend in contrast to the often redundant, trivial or generalist information that schools tend to convey. Having teachings in school end up not being useful in future is also topic on 1050: Forgot Algebra although there Randall conveys that it is normal and not an excuse to boast about one's ignorance.  The title text is a further exaggeration, claiming that striking up a conversation with the strange kid at school could be far more important than all four years of a high school education.  There is always the chance that ""that strange kid"" might turn out to be the next Mark Zuckerberg. Or that he knows a guy who can find you your first job. Or he's the one who tells you about his interest in a to you yet unknown topic and sparks your interest in it as well, and maybe it turns into your future career.

521: 2008 Christmas Special,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/521:_2008_Christmas_Special,programming,How could you possibly think typing 'import skynet' was a good idea?',"This comic is the xkcd Christmas Special from the year 2008. The prologue states that due to the 2008 financial crisis, only very few images of the strip could be produced, leaving the others to be blacked out. It is therefore left to the reader to reconstruct the whole story based on the given images. While it is claimed that the reconstruction should be rather easy, the complicated and abstruse plot-line makes it nearly impossible to fill the gaps. Any attempt at inferring the missing images would therefore be largely guesswork. The comic features the well-known xkcd characters getting involved in a strange fight with cyborgs and raptors on Christmas Eve.  The line ""We apologize for the inconvenience."" is possibly a reference to the famous book series The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams. It appears there as God's Final Message to His Creation, written in letters of fire on the side of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains.  Panel 2: Megan strives to outdo some Christmas lights she has seen on YouTube.  Panel 3: Dissatisfied with her work, Megan is thinking about alternative ways improve her light arrangement. The idea of firing Sodium pellets into snow is probably a bad one, as Sodium reacts exothermically with water and may, in large amounts, induce explosions.  Panel 5: Probably still obsessed with the idea of creating a large and impressive light display, Megan has constructed an electronic device with an Arduino processor, perhaps to make the light chain show patterns. However, the amount of energy she used was apparently too high, causing one of the control boards to sublimate- go directly from a solid to a gaseous state without an intermediate liquid phase. She then wishes she could make the system self-repairing.  Panel 7: Megan's device has developed artificial intelligence, allowing it to feel. This is presumably a result of Megan attempting to make the device self-repairing. This common trope in science-fiction works usually leads to the system's attempting to eradicate its creator. Cueball attributes the emergence of a personality to awesome ease and power of programming in Python.  Panel 11: Out of context, this panel introduces the idea of Santa Claus being a Muslim. This may be a reference to the persistent Internet rumors that Barack Obama is a Muslim, though he declares himself to be a Christian. However, the statement could also relate to the fact the Santa Claus is usually displayed with a large beard, which is sometimes also sported by conservative Muslims.  Or it could just be non-sensical.  Panel 13: At this point the self-aware Christmas light control systems has apparently released cyborgs that tried to kill Megan and Cueball. In order to repel the cyborgs, they have cloned Velociraptors. Cueball expresses doubt whether that was really a good idea. Velociraptors appear frequently in xkcd, cf. comics 87, 135 and 292.  Panel 17: As predicted, the raptors have gone wild, but Megan, Cueball and the two smaller characters (perhaps their children) managed to cage the dinosaurs. They believe themselves safe unless the raptors learn how to build lightsabers. This is a reference to a line in Jurrasic Park where the main characters believe themselves safe, unless the raptors can learn how to open doors.  Panel 19: The raptors have indeed succeeded with constructing lightsabers and must now be fought. The ""Clever girl"" is a reference to a line from Jurassic Park where the raptors outflank (and kill) one of the human characters wearing a similar hat.  Panel 23: IT billionaire Bill Gates has mistakenly killed Santa Claus, possibly in a sword fight. He claims to have mistaken him for Richard Stallman, a prominent free software activist. (Gates strongly opposes the idea of free software and is therefore considered an antagonist by many of its supporters.) The most striking resemblance between Stallman and Santa Claus is probably the long and untamed beard. Comic 225 is one of the most famous xkcd comics and features Stallman involved in a sword fight.  Panel 29: Megan asks Black Hat where he obtained the enormously large christmas tree that can be seen on the right side of the picture. It is implied that he logged Yggdrasil, a giant ash tree in Norse mythology. According to tradition, Yggdrasil is the world tree representing the whole of creation and holding together the cosmological structure.  Panel 31: Randall wishes Merry Christmas to all xkcd readers.  The title text refers to panel 7. In Python, modules are imported using the ""import module"" syntax. Skynet is a self-aware artificial intelligence system featured in the Terminator film series as the main antagonist. Importing the skynet module might therefore account for Megan's system's developing an evil personality.  Note that this comic was first published in another version that had panel 29 as panel 27 and the ""Merry Christmas from xkcd"" message at the bottom. As 27 is not a prime number, the current version was published in lieu of the erroneous one.  It has been observed that the top left nine panels form a Glider in Conway's Game of Life. The glider is sometimes used as an emblem representing hacker subculture, although rotated by 90 degrees. It remains however unclear whether the occurrence in the comic is intentional or owed to the prime number pattern.","The 2008 XKCD Christmas Special Due to the slowing economy, we could only afford to produce the prime-numbered panels.

534: Genetic Algorithms,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/534:_Genetic_Algorithms,programming,Just make sure you don't have it maximize instead of minimize.,"In the Computer science field of Artificial intelligence, a Genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems. Genetic algorithms belong to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms, which generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover.  In particular, genetic algorithms are designed to evolve, with various mechanisms being used to mimic natural selection.  One such mechanism is to assign ""costs"" to various aspects of the program, and to select for programs which minimize a Fitness function calculated as the sum of all these costs (thus mimicking organisms in an environment where they have to compete for limited resources).  The line indicated by an arrow is a reference to the Terminator series, in which the main antagonist is an artificial intelligence known as Skynet that seeks to destroy all humans. By setting an absurdly high cost for an algorithm transforming into Skynet, the coder makes a preventive measure against the algorithm achieving such sentience.  The line about water crossing is a possible reference to the old computer game Oregon Trail, in which crossing water was hazardous. This video game was referenced again in 623: Oregon.  The title text refers to the method by which the program select the desired option, with minimizing being where the program seeks the lowest possible number, and maximizing where the program seeks the highest possible number. When dealing with cases such as generating profit, maximization would obviously be preferred over minimization; but selecting maximization here would be disastrous as it would always chose the BecomingSkynet option before any other due to its massive cost.","[Code displayed, presumably from an IDE.] def getSolutionCosts(navigationCode): fuelStopCost = 15 extraComputationCost = 8  [There is a giant arrow pointing to the next line.] thisAlgorithmBecomingSkynetCost = 999999999 waterCrossingCost = 45  Genetic algorithms tip: Always include this in your fitness function."
554: Not Enough Work,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/554:_Not_Enough_Work,programming,It's even harder if you're an asshole who pronounces <> brackets.,"In some companies, programmers can find themselves under-employed. This may be because these companies have little programming work until something breaks or needs upgrading, or perhaps they are between projects, or simply waiting for a go-ahead.  Coders still need to make themselves available to perform emergency fixes, but they may have no other assigned work. This requires them to find constructive ways to spend their time.  Or unconstructive, if that is more fun.  Dvorak is a keyboard layout that was proposed in 1936 as an alternative to the existing, entrenched QWERTY layout, developed in the 1870s. The QWERTY keyboard is the standard in the US, but some features in its layout are  based on mechanical considerations rather than the optimum placement for typing speed. For example, common letter combinations such as 'st' and 'th' had to be arranged so that their operating levers were separated from each other, lest they cause jams and slow down the typist. More than sixty years later, such mechanical considerations could be overcome, and Dvorak designed his keyboard layout with typing efficiency in mind.  The Dvorak keyboard was ultimately unsuccessful. It still persists today, but has never threatened the dominance of the QWERTY keyboard.  Even if the Dvorak layout is  more efficient (which is still a matter for debate, see the uncomfortable truth in 561: Well), QWERTY was and is the standard. This means that every keyboard user has to learn QWERTY anyway, and there is insufficient benefit in spending the time to learn a new layout, especially when you would have to switch back and forth between Dvorak and QWERTY as the situation demands.  Therefore, even seriously considering the switch is a sign that you really have nothing better to do.  Another joke is that even though the coder has plenty of spare time on his hands to practice on Dvorak, he has only been able to 'almost' match his old typing speed.  This was the first comic to refer to Dvorak, but since then it has become a recurrent theme on xkcd. A later comic, 1445: Efficiency, mentions, in the title text, how you could waste lots of time testing to see if Dvorak is faster.  Gopher is a defunct internet protocol, which has been completely superseded by HTTP. It's a perfect example of the kind of thing a programmer might implement in the absence of other, more useful work. (As an aside, the protocol is named for the mascot of the University of Minnesota, where it was developed.)  HTML and XHTML are markup languages used to describe web documents. XHTML-strict is a more restricted version of HTML that excludes certain redundant tags like <center>, which is theoretically no longer necessary now that <div> and <span> exist. Haiku, on the other hand, is a kind of Japanese poetry. Rather than having a rhyming meter like Western poetry, Japanese poetry has strict restrictions on syllable count; a haiku must contain three lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables, respectively. The section of code given is HTML markup, and would be read by a web developer like this:  Which can be divided in syllables like this:  This meets the syllable requirements. Restricting yourself to writing markup in this form would be extremely challenging and time-consuming and pointless, so it, too, is a good sign that coders need more real work to do. The title text notes that if you are one of those assholes that are actually pronouncing the angle-brackets, then it would be even harder to write HTML in Haiku format. ""Left angle bracket"" and ""right angle bracket"" take up five syllables each on their own. (The asshole part is Randall's opinion about those who do pronounce <>). Haiku was mentioned later in 622: Haiku Proof.  Finally, the last panel mentions the biggest timesink of them all: webcomics! (Or, even worse, wikis devoted to explaining the jokes in webcomics.)  A haiku-compliant programming language does in fact exist: David Morgan-Mar (a creator of many esoteric and parodic languages) invented Haifu, a language that will only compile if it is arranged into subsets of 5 + 7 + 5 syllables. Unlike the HTML example in the comic, Haifu derives its functions and syntax from concepts in Eastern philosophy (such as naming its variable types after the five elements, replacing true and false with yin and yang, and defining arithmetic in terms of creation and destruction).","[Above the first two panels there is a caption:] Signs your coders don't have enough work to do:  [Cueball sitting in an office chair at his workstation, with Ponytail standing behind him.] Cueball: I'm almost up to my old typing speed in Dvorak  [Cueball is standing next to a server rack pointing at it while looking the other way at a Cueball-like guy.

568: Well 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/568:_Well_2,programming,"But I've made $13.72 already today! Ow, stop throwing pennies.","This is the second comic in the Well series: The first was 561: Well.  The average person's lifespan is 80 years now. So, while immortality may become a reality within the coming century, Ponytail won't live long enough to achieve it.  Cueball is looking for a programming language that does not need him to be specific about his ideas. When humans communicate ideas to other humans they may be vague but still understood, since the listener can infer a lot of detail from context and basic knowledge. Until we start 'raising' compilers (like you would a child) compilers will not possess that feature. Hence the need for the programmer to be exact in communicating his ideas to the compiler. No language will ever be able to change that. Cueball complains that he knows what he means.  Finally we find out that one of Megan's admirers, Mike, whom she avoids, is hiding in the well. He has been waiting for her to come for her uncomfortable truth, so he can make her believe that she is actually attracted to him. But she is not so easily fooled and calls his bluff, telling him to come out of the well.  The title text suggests he might also have been down there for the money everyone is throwing in to the  well to get this uncomfortable truth. So it has never been a working well. When everyone (or just Megan) finds out about this, Mike is bombarded with the all the pennies people have brought along.  In the comic game 1608: Hoverboard there is also a well in the left part of the world. This well has the same type of covered top and at the bottom (it is very deep) there is a girl and above her a coin, like the one thrown into a wishing well. On these links, to images on xkcd ; used in the game, the top and the bottom of the well can be seen.","[Four people are lined up by a covered well, Ponytail in front followed by Cueball, Megan and a man with some kind of hat (could be Beret Guy, but only half of his head is shown so it is not clear).

For every 0x5f375a86 we learn about, there are thousands we never see.","Cueball has solved some tricky and very important problem in computer science, related to queuing theory.  The comic splits into two timelines. Showing the brilliant computer code he'd written to somebody who actually knows computer code allows the academic to see the programmer's true brilliance and get him much-earned plaudits from the academic community.  In the alternate timeline - implied to be what actually happens - the boss, not possessing that knowledge, simply sees the results and not the means Cueball used to attain them. He then gives Cueball another assignment. This, sadly, is the usual course of events in bueraucracy, which only seems to care about your results, not how you came about them. To drive in the point, the boss asks Cueball to do something as simple as setting up e-mail on the office phones, a stark contrast to the skill and creativity Cueball would have needed to write his code in the first panel.  The references in the title text are to the P versus NP problem, a famous unsolved problem in computer science, and the ""magical constant"" (0x5f375a86) used in finding the fast inverse square root, i.e. y=x−½ - no-one knows quite who came up this very useful bit of code, but it was discovered hiding in the graphics code of the video game Quake III Arena.   The title text may be a reference to Stephen Jay Gould's quotation: “I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.” about how great minds may be exploited by the commercial world and their genius go unknown.","[Cueball sits at a desk in front of a computer.

743: Infrastructures,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/743:_Infrastructures,programming,"The heartfelt tune it plays is CC licensed, and you can get it from my seed on JoinDiaspora.net whenever that project gets going.","Cueball has sent an essay to a friend. While the essay itself was good, his friend was worried because the essay was in the .doc format, the proprietary format that old versions of Microsoft Word used. The friend advises Cueball to use a format based on an open standard,  possibly a format like ODF, ODT, ODS, ODP, or OpenOffice XML.   Cueball, who does not appreciate his friend's contradicting him, argued that the friend is making petty fights about the details of software instead of simply bothering that the software works (which is, in essence, a primordial purpose of software). Given that it can be a challenge to move from a familiar proprietary application to an open-source rival which may lack compatibility, features, support and popularity, Cueball has *some* justification for his stance.  The bearded fellow brings up that he is just concerned about the current proprietary software infrastructure that forces users to use software in a specific way, penalizing them for sharing the software or even preventing looking at the source code in order to learn what the program actually does or how it works. Cueball makes a retort that his friend has an arrogance that crowds out his perspective while claiming that he is autistic. However, it is highly unlikely that Cueball truly believes his friend is autistic. Instead, it's much more likely that he's comparing his friend's behavior to that of people with autism(such as his intense fixation on things that seem trivially important to others), similar to the banter used on online forums and imageboards such as 4chan's /g/ board.   Seven years later, Cueball runs to the friend, alarmed about Facebook's heavy policies about its complete control about the information its users submit. Since Facebook is like Microsoft in its lack of transparency about their services and taking away a lot of control from the user, the fellow retorts with playing ""the world's tiniest open-source violin.""   This is dubious since ""playing the world's smallest violin"" is a sarcastic expression that denotes that the speaker will not give pity to the recipient.  In response to this comic, a 3D model for a tiny violin was released as open source files.  The title text references the following pieces of infrastructure that are compatible with the ""free software"" ideology:  The problem with the lack of open source and Facebook is also the subject of 1390: Research Ethics.","2003: [Cueball approaches a bearded fellow.] Cueball: Did you get my essay? Bearded Fellow: Yeah, it was good! But it was a .doc; You should really use a more open- Cueball: Give it a rest already.

Bearded Fellow: I just want people to care about the infrastructures we're building and who- Cueball: No, you just want to feel smugly superior. You have no sense of perspective and are probably autistic.  2010: Cueball: Oh my God! We handed control of our social world to Facebook and they're DOING EVIL STUFF!

754: Dependencies,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/754:_Dependencies,programming,"The prereqs for CPSC 357, the class on package management, are CPSC 432, CPSC 357, and glibc2.5 or later.","A compiler is a program that converts code, written in a particular programming language, into an executable program. A section of code is said to be dependent on a second segment of code if the results of the first segment are potentially impacted by the second segment. Dependency resolution is part of compiler design, and is the study of determining and correcting dependencies which result in an unwanted, ambiguous, or impossible definition of the dependent section. Requiring that an action occurs if and only if the action has already occurred, like the prerequisite in this comic, is one type of potentially unwanted dependency.  The comic envisions a college computer science course (CPSC432) focusing on ""compiler design with dependency resolution"" which has itself as a prerequisite. The joke is that the prerequisite is an unresolved dependency, as you must complete this course before you can enroll in it, a phenomenon called Catch-22.  This dependency would send a poorly designed compiler into an infinite loop. In real life, the problem is solved by allowing an object to satisfy itself as a prerequisite. This stops the compiler's infinite loop, but may not produce the desired functionality in the program. Another layer of the joke may be that any student who successfully enrolls in the class already knows this solution because they must have employed it in order to get past the apparent infinite recursion in the class prerequisites.  Managing dependencies is useful in other areas of computer science, e.g. package management. Collections of files are known as ""packages"". A software package might require that a particular operating system patch (a type of package) be installed first. That package might in turn require other packages be installed, and so on. Therefore, a package installer must know the dependencies of a package, and be able to figure out whether any required packages are missing before continuing with the installation.   The title text envisions a course on package management which has itself as a prerequisite, as well as the compiler design course with the impossible prerequisite presented in the main comic (CPSC 432), and glibc2.5 or greater. By looking at the course number it can be observed that CPSC 432 is a fourth year course, and this package management course (CPSC 357) is a third year course. Glibc is a commonly used package on Unix systems, and therefore should be taught in the course. This continues the joke since this course has the following unresolved dependencies:  The letter code ""CPSC"" is the letter code Christopher Newport University, Randall's alma mater, uses for Computer Science.","[A portion of a page from an imaginary course catalog.] Page 3    Department  Course  Description  Prereqs   Computer science  CPSC 432  Intermediate compiler design, with a focus on dependency resolution   CPSC 432  [The very top of the text for the next course in the table is visible but unreadable.]"
801: Golden Hammer,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/801:_Golden_Hammer,programming,"Took me five tries to find the right one, but I managed to salvage our night out--if not the boat--in the end.","Java is a programming language touted for its Portability™, which sometimes leads to it being used in systems where it really just shouldn't be used. Cueball laments that the hardware he's tinkering with, despite being used for a single purpose, has its firmware written in Java; since the microprocessor is unknown, it's quite possible the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) had to be ported over to the processor before the hardware designers could write firmware for it. Presumably, they considered this worthwhile to be able to write the control code in a language they're comfortable with, even though it probably would have been much simpler to just write the control code in whatever language they used to port the JVM in the first place.  Black Hat explains that this is really an example of an age-old adage: ""When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"", also referred to as the ""law of the instrument"" or, as in the title, the ""golden hammer"". The hardware developers probably only knew Java, and when they thought about how to write firmware for their new device, ""Java"" was the only solution that occurred to them.  Of course, instead of a hammer and a nail, Black Hat's analogy is about using bolt-cutters and vodka to get through the lock on Wolf Blitzer's boathouse. Not-so-coincidentally, Black Hat is holding a pair of bolt-cutters and a bottle of vodka. The implication is that Black Hat did, in fact, break into Wolf Blitzer's boathouse the previous night, which is why he has just now entered the door at the start of the strip. The changes he makes to the adage implies that he believes vodka and boltcutters are designed specifically to be used on Wolf Blitzer's boathouse, an interpretation that fits Black Hat's warped and anarchic disposition. As he is carrying both of these items, it also implies that he has just used those instruments for exactly that purpose. Cueball however, being extremely jaded by the (mis)use of Java, can only bring himself to tell that he's glad that Black Hat had a nice night.  The title text implies that Black Hat had to break into a number of boathouses before he found Wolf's, and that his boat did not survive the evening.  The use of the phrase 'our night' allows us to infer that Black Hat may have been with Danish, his partner in crime.","[Black Hat is going through a door, a bottle in his hand. A voice speaks to him from off panel.] Cueball: Seriously? This thing runs Java? It's single-purpose hardware!  [Cueball is sitting at a computer, holding some device which is wired to a box, and pointing at the screen.] Cueball: I bet they actually hired someone to spend six months porting this JVM so they could write their 20 lines of code in a familiar setting.  [Black Hat has a pair of bolt cutters in the hand that had been obscured in the first panel.] Black Hat: Well, you know what they say— When all you have is a pair of bolt cutters and a bottle of vodka, everything looks like the lock on the door of Wolf Blitzer's boathouse. Cueball: I'm glad you had a nice night."
844: Good Code,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/844:_Good_Code,programming,You can either hang out in the Android Loop or the HURD loop.,"The comic references the common meme of programmers that one can't actually write good code. Either the code is done quickly with shoddy ""code style"", weak logical structure, or any number of other kludges and hacks which turn maintenance of the code into a nightmare; or else it is written well and beautifully structured, but can never be completed before changes in the situation cause the original code design to be insufficient for one or multiple reasons.  Either situation eventually leads to the need to completely start from scratch, designing and writing the program's code all over again. Of course, the writing of this new program is also locked in the perpetual cycle of choosing between ugly/bad code that works marginally well, or good/pretty code that never gets completed before being obsolete.  Additionally, the humorous point is being further emphasized for the primary target audience, programmers, by using an infinite loop - or more precisely, 2 possible loops and 1 forced loop in the flowchart itself.  Also, of particular note, is the fact that Randall (the author) drives home the point of the inescapability of the infinite loop(s) by the use of the additional, disconnected, and logically unreachable portion of the flowchart. This disconnect points out that the only way to actually get to ""Good Code"" using the flow chart would be to follow a path of actions — which does not start at the prescribed place — for which there is only an unknown and possibly unknowable starting action which no one has ever discovered previously. Other flowchart comics, several of which are also infinite loops, can be found here.  The title text, ""You can either hang out in the Android Loop or the HURD loop,"" makes a dig at both communities: claiming that Android developers always opt for fast, ugly code, necessitating frequent fixes and updates, while Hurd developers perennially choose to ""do the job right"" but can therefore never seem to finish their project.  The GNU Hurd Project aims to create the kernel for the GNU Operating System (the kernel being the central and most indispensable component). The GNU Project is most famous these days as a result of GNU/Linux (commonly called just ""Linux""), which is an operating system that uses the Linux kernel with the GNU system environment. From the beginning the GNU Project has planned to design their own kernel, the Hurd, virtually from scratch, and given a relatively clean slate with which to work, elected to employ a number of promising and theoretically elegant design concepts. Despite or, as Randall suggests, because of this, the Hurd has been mired in development hell for many years (for decades, in fact) with little progress towards actual usability outside of a small community of kernel hackers. While runnable GNU/Hurd operating systems do exist, they're still basically experimental, and the Hurd remains a collection of research software the design goalposts for which keep receding as other, more pragmatically-engineered technologies continue to be developed (the Linux kernel itself being the canonical first instance of this).  Finally, the transcript of this comic is itself somewhat humorous (an additional inside joke, if you will) in that it converts the flowchart into a simple list of instructions (aka pseudo-code) using numbered lines as reference points for identifying which instruction to read and follow next. This process is basically identical to the oft-maligned programming technique of using so-called ""goto loops."" — Furthermore, there is also a slight cross-reference between infinite loops and goto loops which is probably being referenced, in that goto loops are often criticized (whether accurately or not) as being more likely to create unintended infinite loops in code... primarily because of the difficulty inherent in keeping track of possible entry and exit paths, especially when making edits to the code at a later time.","[The comic is a flowchart In order to explain this in text, follow the line numbers.

Paired punctuation marks must always be matched up with a corresponding closing mark, otherwise a so-called syntax error occurs. The programming language Lisp (also featured in 224: Lisp) is known for large numbers of nested/paired parentheses. Even in literary works intended only for human consumption, the absence of a matching closing parenthesis (as appears in this sentence or other ""balanced"" punctuation sets creates a mental expectation of eventual closure and completion that remains unfulfilled even long after the unmatched mark is encountered. See what I mean?  There is also reference to 312: With Apologies to Robert Frost which could contain the missing parentheses.  It can also be interpreted as a metaphor, which compares the reader with a Lisp interpreter. The interpreter looks for the parenthesis until the end of the file, where it eventually halts, and prints out the error. The comic claims that if you read an unmatched parenthesis, you will look for it for the rest of the day too.  It also refers to this awkward feeling when you see something (like an unmatched parentheses, speling error or a randomly-placed, comma.

937: TornadoGuard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/937:_TornadoGuard,programming,The bug report was marked 'could not reproduce'.,"This is a comic with a take on an application store - the most common app stores are for iPhones and Android devices. App stores take all the reviews and average the ratings for the overall star rating.   In this comic, we see why this is sometimes a bad idea, especially with something as important as an app called TornadoGuard that should warn the user if a tornado is approaching. In this case, there are three 5 star reviews about the stability and user interface features of the app, left by users who actually never experienced its core functionality (simply because they never used it in a place where a tornado appeared since they got it); however, the only review related to whether the app really works is given the same weight as the others, and sadly for that user the TornadoGuard app failed in alerting the user to an upcoming tornado. Tornadoes are a recurring subject on xkcd. Also see future comic 1098: Star Ratings and 1754: Tornado Safety Tips.   The title text is a call back to 583: CNR. It is a note from the developer's bug report, which said they could not reproduce the error. Of course, they could only reproduce such a failure if there were a tornado coming towards their area. This is a fairly rare situation, especially in certain areas of the world. This lack of suitable testing conditions explains why the actual tornado-prediction portion of their code appears to be faulty.","[The comic is a single panel which resembles a reviews page for a mobile phone application.

Only the romance can get back a little bit of room as time passes. As the threat posed by the cancer wanes, a space opens up (the question marks) that the cancer concern used to occupy.

1163: Debugger,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1163:_Debugger,programming,It can take a site a while to figure out that there's a problem with their 'report a bug' form.,"Cueball mentions to Megan that he can't understand how his mind works, the same mind he uses to understand how things work, and he's not sure if this is a problem. In other words, if he can't understand how his mind works, then how can he tell that it does in fact work and that his perception of reality is accurate? Ordinarily he would use his mind to figure it out, but if his mind really doesn't work, then he'll probably never determine that his mind doesn't work. Understandably, he's a little unsure of how he should feel about this.  Per the comic title, a debugger is a piece of software used by programmers to find bugs in the applications they are making. The title is an allusion to that debuggers are very much like our brains in the aspect described above - most programmers don't understand how debuggers internally work, and they can't be sure that debugger is bug-free - if there is a bug in the debugger itself, it can't be accurately used to find bugs.  The title text alludes to the above problem, in that if a website's ""report a bug"" page is buggy to a degree that it prevents the actual reporting of a bug, then users cannot use the form to report that the form itself is broken. Thus it can take quite some time before the site administrators realize this error, if they do at all, as unless they test it themselves, the administrators are likely relying on users to report problems they find, which they can't, making it appear as if there are no problems. This is somewhat analogous to the ""brain"" dilemma in the main comic, where the usual problem-pondering and resolving method itself can have a problem, but there is no straightforward way to tell.","[Megan and Cueball are at the top of a grassy hill, rendered in silhouette.

1168: tar,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1168:_tar,programming,"I don't know what's worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can't keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I'm still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started.","tar (""tape archive"") is a Unix application that creates (and extracts) archives in the "".tar"" format. It is typically used through the text-based terminal, using cryptic single-letter arguments such as ""tar -cvf archive.tar *"". The comic alludes to the fact that despite years of use of the command, it's still hard to remember the arguments without searching for them, such as with Google.  The title text points out that while much of computing changes very quickly, the tar program, which is very old (originating ca. 1975), is still around and heavily used. And yet, Randall complains he still cannot type out a line of tar command with correct flags without having to look the flags up. Tar is a very common command that Unix users will come across regularly, much like Windows users will come across .zip files. Depending on the flavor of Unix, the order of the flags, or the lack or inclusion of a '-' could render the command incorrect. Most true Unixes (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) not using the GNU utilities would give an error on the above tar example. For such a simple command, it is one that most people need to look up references to use.  The joke here is that a ""tar"" command with perfect syntax on the first try without outside help is such a daunting task that even Rob can't overcome it with confidence, and apologizes for not being able to prevent their imminent death.  The fact that Megan and White Hat assume that Rob can disarm the nuclear bomb because he uses Unix can be referring to an over-generalization fallacy that a partaker in a practice is an expert of a practice. Not all people who use Unix necessarily know how to use tar commands. Then again, since he's the only person nearby who knows any Unix and thus their only hope, their fallacy is pretty justified.  There is probably also a pun on ""tarbomb,"" a poorly created tar archive that, when extracted, dumps a load of files into the current directory that the user has to clean up. And although the bomb looks more like Fat Man, the type of bomb that was used over Nagasaki, at least size-wise, it may also be a pun on the name of the largest ever hydrogen bomb which was called the Tsar Bomba (translation: ""emperor bomb"").  In 208: Regular Expressions Cueball saves the day by knowing regular expressions, although in the title text it is alluded to how easy these may also miss a character.  Rob may refer to Rob Pike, who was a member of the team at AT&T who created Unix.","[Megan and White Hat stand next to a nuclear bomb. The bomb has a hatch open on top, and a small blinking screen.

1185: Ineffective Sorts,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1185:_Ineffective_Sorts,programming,"StackSort connects to StackOverflow, searches for 'sort a list', and downloads and runs code snippets until the list is sorted.","The comic gives examples of four non-functional sorting algorithms written in pseudo-Python.  The first sort is an unfinished merge sort. The merge sort works recursively by dividing a list in half and performing a merge sort to each half. After the two halves are sorted, they are merged, taking advantage of the fact that the two halves are now in correct order and thus the merge can be done efficiently. The author of the merge sort in the comic appears to have given up on writing the sorted-merge part of the sort, which is why it's a half-hearted merge sort, but instead concatenates the halves without sorting. In its current state, the sort would divide the list into elements of size one, then recombine them in their original unsorted order, but in nested lists - making the original data more difficult to work with. The author acknowledges this failing with the comment ""Ummmmm... Here. Sorry.""  The second sort is an ""optimized"" variant of bogosort. A standard bogosort works by randomly shuffling the elements in the list until they are sorted. In a comment, the author points out that this variant of bogosort runs in O(n log(n)), whereas standard bogosorts actually run in expected O(n·n!) time but may never finish. This variant of bogosort finishes so much faster because in most cases it does not actually sort the list, instead reporting a fictitious error in the operating system (a ""kernel page fault"") if the list isn't ordered after shuffling log(n) times.  The bogosort is ""optimized"" because no comparison sort algorithm can possibly do better than O(n log(n)) in the worst case.  The third sort parodies a programmer explaining a quicksort during a job interview. The quicksort works by choosing an index as a pivot value and sorting all elements less than the pivot before the pivot and all the elements greater than the pivot after the pivot. It then does a quicksort to the section less than the pivot and the section greater than the pivot until the whole list is sorted. The interviewee flounders for a little while, then asks whether they can use the standard libraries to call a quicksort. Using the standard library's quicksort would allow the programmer to successfully execute a quicksort, but would not demonstrate that they understand how it works.  The final sort is just a mess. First it checks to see if the list is sorted, and exits if it is. Then it rotates the list by a random amount 10,000 times (as if cutting a deck of cards) and exits if the list is ever sorted. Next, in desperation, it checks if the list is sorted three times. Finally, realizing that they have no chance of success, the author performs the computer equivalent of a Rage Quit and attempts to destroy the computer rather than admit defeat. First, the program attempts to schedule a shutdown of the computer in five seconds, then attempts to delete the current directory, then attempts to delete the user's home directory (presumably the grader's files), and finally all the files on the computer. rm is a POSIX command; the -r and -f flags mean that the remove command will remove all contents of the specified directories and will not prompt the user beforehand. Under the guise of ""portability"", the program runs the equivalent Windows rd command with switches to delete all files from the ""C:"" drive without prompting. Finally, the program returns a list containing the numbers one through five in order.  In the title text, StackOverflow (link) is a question-and-answer site where programmers can ask and answer questions on programming. The author of this code takes advantage of the hopes that someone on StackOverflow knows what they are doing and has posted code to sort a list... and somebody implemented stacksort; well, sort of.",Ineffective sorts
1188: Bonding,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1188:_Bonding,programming,"I'm trying to build character, but Eclipse is really confusing.","This is source code written in the Java programming language which models a parent and a child playing a game of catch.  Normally this game is played with the parent throwing a ball to their child, who catches it and throws it back, and repeated back-and-forth. The comic title ""Bonding"" refers to the building of relationship between the parent and the child. The joke lies in the puns using the words try, throw, catch, and Throwable.  These can refer to actions in the real-life game, but are also keywords in the Java language that are used for exception handling, a method of signaling error conditions and responding to them.  Also, the terms ""parent"" and ""child"" are usually interpreted more abstractly in programming, as generic terms used in hierarchical data structures.  The program, as written, will recursively call the aim method alternately on the parent and the child indefinitely, causing each to take turns throwing and catching the Ball object.  Note that unlike the real game, this program actually has the same person both throwing and catch the same ball on their turn.  The ball is passed onto the other person by aiming it at them, which causes the person to both throw and catch the ball, and aim it back.  This program will also eventually crash with a stack overflow error.  The title text refers to the Eclipse IDE, which is a tool commonly used to develop software in Java. ""Building character"" is something that you would expect a parent to do, in order to instill in his child positive traits, such as confidence and athleticism. This is possibly a reference to Calvin and Hobbes, where Calvin's dad often encourages him to build character in a number of ways, including playing baseball. This is made more likely by other references combining technology and C+H, such as xkcd comics 409, 702, and 1002. However, here, ""build"" might also be a play on the term of ""building"" a program, while ""character"" refers to a data type in programming languages. It may also refer to the common notion that programming in C++ or Java builds character due to their powerful but sometimes finicky libraries.  To compile this Java source code, the two classes would need to be in a .java file. The program defines two classes (types of objects):  The program executes in the following order:",class Ball extends Throwable {} class P{ P target; P(P target) { this.target = target; } void aim (Ball ball) { try { throw ball; } catch (Ball b) { target.aim(b); } } public static void main(String[] args) { P parent = new P(null); P child = new P(parent); parent.target = child; parent.aim(new Ball()); } } 
1266: Halting Problem,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1266:_Halting_Problem,programming,"I found a counterexample to the claim that all things must someday die, but I don't know how to show it to anyone.","In 1936 Alan Turing proved that it's not possible to decide whether an arbitrary program will eventually halt, or run forever. This was later called the Halting problem by Martin Davis. The official definition of the problem is to write a program (actually, a Turing Machine) that accepts as parameters a program and its parameters. That program needs to decide, in finite time, whether that program will ever halt running these parameters.  The halting problem is a cornerstone problem in computer science. It is used mainly as a way to prove a given task is impossible, by showing that solving that task will allow one to solve the halting problem.  Randall, however, is providing a simpler solution. He implements his own code for the question ""Does it halt?"" which always returns ""true"", and directs us to think about the bigger picture.  From a physical perspective, according to our current understanding of physics, this is right. Given enough time, any program will halt. This is due to factors external to the actual program. Sooner or later, electricity will give out, or the memory containing the program will get corrupted by cosmic rays, or corrosion will eat away the silicon in the CPU, or the second law of thermodynamics will lead to the Heat death of the universe. Nothing lasts forever, and this includes a running program.  From a mathematical point of view, this is not true: a Turing machine will never have a hardware failure because it's not a physical machine. It's a theoretical construct, and it's defined mathematically, independent of any physical hardware. Similarly, ⅓ + ⅓ + ⅓ = 1 no matter what any physical hardware you are computing it on claims.  Another interpretation of Randall's code is that the Program in the parentheses is actually being run whenever his function is called, as is consistent with some programming constructs. In this case, the function would wait until the program finishes and exits before returning ""True"". Therefore, Randall's function is mathematically accurate. It does not solve the problem though, as it simply shifts the question to whether the function itself will ever halt.  From a practical point of view, there are of course times that a programmer would want to return ""false"", since some programs can be mathematically shown to run forever.  The title text further relates to this issue by claiming to have found a case where something need not die, but Randall does not know how to actually show it to anyone, because just the fact everyone will die sooner than it doesn't prove it will not die. The wording of the title text might also be a reference to Fermat's Last Theorem.  It should be noted that Randall's solution, barring its unsoundness, solves more than the halting problem in the form it is usually stated. The halting problem requires two parameters (a program and its parameters), while Randall's function only accepts one (the program). The question of whether a program halts for every input can be shown to be even harder to solve than the halting problem, meaning that even if a Turing machine had an additional instruction allowing it to check whether a program halts with given parameters, it still could not always confirm that a given program that halts for all parameters does so.  The code in this comic is written in pseudocode, to demonstrate the ""algorithm"" rather than an implementation in some existing programming language. The syntax resembles a mix of C and Python.",[A short computer program.]  The big picture solution to the halting problem.
1270: Functional,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1270:_Functional,programming,Functional programming combines the flexibility and power of abstract mathematics with the intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics.,"White Hat questions Cueball's faith in functional programming. Cueball responds saying, ""Tail recursion is its own reward.""  Functional programming is a style of computer programming that uses only function calls, and not other traditional programming tools like loops. Functional programming often uses recursive functions to serve the same purpose that loops serve in other programming languages. A recursive function calls itself again, typically with slightly different arguments. E.g., the following factorial function is recursive because it calls itself again for any argument value n greater than 1.  Tail recursion is a particular sort of recursion that often compiles into more efficient code (see the longer explanation below), but the differences between tail recursion and other sorts of recursion aren't important to the humor of this comic.  The comic is a pun on two readings of ""Tail recursion is its own reward"". The expression ""X is its own reward"" often is used to suggest that X is intrinsically valuable in its own right. Some (but not all) programmers and mathematicians find recursive functions elegant and intrinsically pleasing, so would take tail recursion to be its own reward in this sense. Since recursive functions call themselves again, and make use of the resulting values, there is also a sense in which recursive functions also serve as their own ""reward"" - i.e., the recursive function itself returns the values that the function requires to perform its tasks. So even if you don't find tail recursion intrinsically pleasing, there is still this technical sense in which it is its own reward anyway.  The title text is humorous in part because it violates two expectations. First, expressions of the form ""X combines some trait of Y with some trait of Z"" usually talk about combining traits of two different things (i.e., Y is not equal to Z) whereas this text surprises the reader by having ""abstract mathematics"" occupy the role of both Y and Z. And second, such expressions usually list two positive traits. The first listed trait (the ""flexibility and power of abstract mathematics"") is pretty clearly positive. However the second trait (the ""intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics"") is less clearly positive. Many people actually find abstract mathematics to be quite lacking in intuitive clarity, and for much the same reasons many people often find functional programming also to be lacking in intuitive clarity. So the title text invites the reader to puzzle over whether it really is a positive thing for functional programming to be able to claim to match the ""intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics"", or whether Randall might instead have just smacked functional programming with a funny backhanded compliment.  Functional programming is a famous paradigm (or style) in modern programming that favors functions that can be evaluated like mathematical functions, i.e., the value returned only depends on the input given. Imperative programs often make use of one or more variables that are external to the function that is currently executing. This means that an ""imperative function"" may return a different result for the same input due to changes in a non-local variable, whereas a ""functional function"" will in theory ALWAYS return the same result for a given input, though in practice the functional programming languages also support the non-local variables.  Unlike procedures, functions always return a value. For example, sine(x) returns 1 when x is 90°. Furthermore, the function may call itself (usually with slightly different parameters), thus effectively starting a loop. This is called recursion.  In order to iterate, imperative programs usually use loops. Functional programs usually use recursion instead.  For example, the factorial function (e.g. ""factorial(5) = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1"") can be coded imperatively as:  An imperative, recursive (but not tail-recursive) implementation can look like this:  In this situation, the recursion stops when the argument (n) is not greater than zero. Without the conditional definition, it would be an infinite loop. Tail recursion is a special case of recursion whose very last operation is to invoke the function itself or return a definite value. The previous example is not tail-recursive, since after the call to ""factorial(n-1)"", the returned value has to be multiplied by n.  This (functional) example is tail recursive inside the helper function:  e.g.  In functional programming, tail recursion is detected by the compiler or interpreter and can be executed as efficiently as loops in imperative programming languages. This makes tail recursion an essential programming technique in functional programming.  Cueball is making a play on words where ""Tail recursion is its own reward"" is used both in the ""it is worth doing on elegance and intellectually satisfying grounds alone"" sense and in the sense that ""the 'tail call' of a function is its final step, and is the final step (and hence the result/reward) for all levels of a tail-recursive function"".  The title text says that to abstract mathematicians functional programming is both powerful and flexible, as well as intuitive and clear since it comes very close to the way mathematicians usually describe functions. The humorous contrast is that, to non-mathematicians including the software engineers, functional programming can be exactly the opposite (thus being non-intuitive and unclear as abstract mathematics appears to them). Even the mathematicians often spend years of work to discover the subtle mistakes in the lengthy proofs. This leaves the reader unclear as to whether the statement is sarcastic or not. And it is also a reference to a common saying among the fans of functional programming about the imperative programming language, 'C': ""C combines the flexibility and power of assembly language with the user-friendliness of assembly language"", which is a humorous take on the original saying ""C combines the flexibility and power of assembly language with the user-friendliness of a high-level language"".","[White Hat stands behind Cueball, who is sitting at a computer.] White Hat: Why do you like functional programming so much? What does it actually get you? Cueball: Tail recursion is its own reward."
1275: int(pi),http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1275:_int(pi),programming,"If replacing all the '3's doesn't fix your code, remove the 4s, too, with 'ceiling(pi) / floor(pi) * pi * r^floor(pi)'. Mmm, floor pie.","This comic purports to provide a tip to programmers, that the number ""3"" is cursed and shouldn't be used. There is no explanation given as to why the number 3 is cursed, and it could well have been chosen arbitrarily. The title text hints that the consequence for using the cursed number is non-functioning code, a pain for any programmer. The absurdity of the number 3 somehow being cursed is part of the humor.  To assist the programmer, the comic gives an example of how to avoid the use of the number 3, by using a slightly convoluted method of using int(pi), which means the integer part of pi, without the fractional part. Pi, an irrational number, has a value starting 3.14159..., making int(pi) equal to 3. This is demonstrated in a formula to calculate the volume of a sphere, normally (4/3)*pi*(r^3), but converted for avoidance of the number 3 to (4/int(pi))*pi*(r^int(pi)).  For a number of reasons it is a good programming practice to use variables and constants where a value is used in multiple places, however this is not typically used in the case of natural numbers. There are unusual situations where this type of programming is a valid method, however typically for more specific circumstances, and not a certain number being seen as cursed.  In the title text, Randall takes the joke a step further, suggesting the usage of floor and ceiling functions: ceiling(pi) would be pi rounded up to the next integer, which is 4; and floor(pi) is pi rounded down to the next integer, which is 3. (Note that int(n) and floor(n) have the same value when n is greater or equal to zero. For values less than zero, int(n) is equal to ceiling(n).)  The joke here plays on the fact that basic rules of programming are confusing and novice programmers are often told to simply not do certain things without any explanation (see 292: goto). This includes, in particular, a general proscription against ""magic numbers"" in the code. Replacing all significant magic numbers with named constants makes programs easier to read, understand and maintain. Randall takes this to an extreme by suggesting that certain numbers could be inherently problematic, but the general idea is perfectly believable.  Mmm... Floor pie. is a reference to Homer Simpson.  See also Cargo cult programming.","volume(r) = (4/int(pi))*pi*r^int(pi) Programming Tip: The number ""3"" is cursed. Avoid it."
1277: Ayn Random,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1277:_Ayn_Random,programming,"In a cavern deep below the Earth, Ayn Rand, Paul Ryan, Rand Paul, Ann Druyan, Paul Rudd, Alan Alda, and Duran Duran meet together in the Secret Council of /(\b[plurandy]+\b ?){2}/i.","The comic is an attack on the problems with the philosophy of ""Objectivism"". White Hat explains to Cueball a program he wrote, the ""Ayn Random Number Generator"", which is a pun on Ayn Rand, the name of a writer who created a philosophical system known as Objectivism. The joke is an attack on her philosophy, which claims to be a completely fair mechanism for distributing resources, but inherently favors those who start out with more resources, or already in a position to acquire the resources. It also has a strong overarching theme that people that believe in objectivism are inherently better than other people, and thus deserve what extra resources can be acquired - as with the Ayn Random Number Generator, which claims to be completely fair and balanced, but actually favors some numbers - which White Hat explains by saying that they deserve to come up more because they're inherently better.  Now, objectivists, of course, would challenge the above portrayal, but the joke is, in the end, an attack on Ayn Rand's philosophies. A more nuanced description is that objectivists believe that the primary aim of life is to maximise personal happiness. In their view, if some humans are born more capable of satisfying their desires than other people, they deserve to reap greater rewards from life than others, no matter the cost to those others.  As an aside, ""biased"" random number generators exist. They're called weighted random number generators, and they have many practical applications when the programmer isn't lying about the number generator's function and output.  The title text identifies a group of people whose names match the regular expression /(\b[plurandy]+\b ?){2}/i. A step-by-step explanation of the expression:  Overall, it matches two words separated by a space, composed entirely of the letters in [plurandy], which is what all the names listed have in common.  As an aside, if the entirety of the title text is matched against the regular expression, it matches ""and Duran"" instead of ""Duran Duran"".  Since the primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is rationality (or, at least, ""rationality"" as defined by Rand: her critics argue that the conclusions she reached do not actually derive inevitably from her premises and that additional, unstated assumptions are necessary to make the system work), the implication may be that the random number generator favors rational numbers (numbers that can be written as a fraction, i.e. a quotient p/q). On the other hand, given computers cannot store data of unlimited length, it is impossible for any real world computer random number generator to produce an irrational number in any of the usual integer or floating point representations—so probably not.  (Although a computer could encode irrationals or generate them randomly if it uses another representation, one of the standard algebraic number representations, for instance.)  Alternately, an Objectivist might argue that if the intent of the comic is to attack or mock Objectivism, then the comic inadvertently satirizes itself via the ""rationality"" interpretation.","[Cueball sitting at a laptop, White Hat behind him.] Cueball: This Ayn Random number generator you wrote claims to be fair, but the output is biased toward certain numbers. White Hat: WELL, MAYBE THOSE NUMBERS ARE JUST INTRINSICALLY BETTER!"
1296: Git Commit,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1296:_Git_Commit,programming,Merge branch 'asdfasjkfdlas/alkdjf' into sdkjfls-final,"This comic refers to the Git source code revision control software, which saves earlier versions of files and folders for later access into a special repository. This comes handy when you want to try out whether an idea works (branching). Further, you can collaborate with others by use of remote repositories. Perhaps most importantly, it allows members of the development team to find key changes in the history, later.  A commit is a saved version in a Git repository; a commit comes with a message that is supposed to describe what the commit contains, similar to the edit summaries used on MediaWiki sites such as explain xkcd and on this explanation. Randall, however, finds himself losing interest in the commit messages the more code he writes and winds up just using placeholder text or jokes to himself. Presumably, this is because his separate commits are part of a large effort that can't be effectively summarized, and where there's no particular urgent need to differentiate the commits. Seeing as in this context 12 hours of coding can be considered ""dragging on,"" it's safe to assume that the kinds of commits Randall is talking about are not for some major in-production project, nor for something that a lot of other people are working on. In both of those cases, one would be much more likely to use descriptive commit messages, since you want to flag things that are important, either from a technical standpoint (e.g. ""fix the thing that's making the site not work"") or for the benefit of others who want to know which commits they should be paying attention to.  The phrase ""Merge branch 'asdfasjkfdlas/alkdjf' into sdkjfls-final"" mimics the phrasing used by Git. A branch is a specific sequence of commits which can be made in parallel to other branches of development, and later merged. Here, we see that Randall has also gotten lazy with his branch names: ""branch 'asdfasjkfdlas/alkdjf'"" might be the series of two commits starting with ""here have code"". ""sdkjfls-final"" could be the branch indicated by the vertical string of circles on the left, into which the other more branch is merged in commit ""adkfjslkdfjsdklfj"".  Most git tools show the commit history with the most recent commits first, so showing the oldest first like this would require something like the --reverse option.  The comments go from being pretty detailed as to his thoughts and reasons for the code (""enabled config file parsing""), to relatively uninformative summaries (""misc bugfixes""), to completely uninformative words (""more code""), and then finally he doesn't even bother trying to come up with words, instead just hitting a key (""aaaaaaaa"") or semi-random keys (""adkfjslkdfjsdklfj""), then goes back to typing words but words that have a bit of a craziness to them rather than having anything to do with describing the code (""my hands are typing words"").  The ""adkfjslkdfjsdklfj"" line and similar garbage in the title text comes from having your hands on the ""home row"" on a standard QWERTY keyboard, then hitting ""random"" keys without moving your fingers from their standard home row positions.  The keys you hit ""randomly"" will be combinations of A, S, D, and F on the left hand, and J, K, L, and ; on the right hand (although the ; key seems to have been avoided, possibly because without the presence of surrounding quotes a ; character will end the comment). It is common to see stuff like that when a person is required to type something — i.e. a mandatory field — but they have no interest in typing anything meaningful or no idea what to write, so they just hit the easiest keys to hit and call it done.

1306: Sigil Cycle,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1306:_Sigil_Cycle,programming,"The cycle seems to be 'we need these symbols to clarify what types of things we're referring to!' followed by 'wait, it turns out words already do that.'","In computer programming, a variable is a way of storing information temporarily, for use later in the program. There are different types of variables, called data types, such as integers, strings, characters, and booleans, all of them holding different types of information. Integers hold whole numbers, strings hold text, and so on. Variables traditionally have names that identify their purpose, and a programmer should usually be able to infer from this variable name what type of variable it is. For example, if you want to store the name of the customer in a catalogue service, you might store the text in a string variable called ""NameOfCustomer"". Because it is fairly clear that names are made up of text, it is logical that this variable would be a string variable - if you didn't have any other information about it.  A sigil in computer programming is a symbol that appears before the variable name. It is an alternative method of telling someone who is reading the program code what data type the variable is. Rather than relying on logic, then, to know that NameOfCustomer is a string, you might use a sigil ""$"" before the variable name, as in $NameOfCustomer, which would specify that the variable can hold text. Sigils can also specify the scope of a variable, which refers to where the variable can be used in a program, and which parts of the program can access that variable. Sigils are useful in some ways because you don't have to refer to previous program code or find where the variable is declared (created) to know what data type it is. They also provide some level typing in languages that do not explicitly declare the type of the variable.  Most programming languages have a different method for storing variables, although some languages may use the same variable types under different names. The following are the programming languages referenced in the comic and how they use variables.  As is noted by the comic, the use of sigils to indicate types of variables varies between programming languages, from strict enforcement in languages like Perl, to their complete absence in languages like C++ (but see Hungarian Notation). The comic notes that the use of sigils seems to be cyclic, especially if you count things like hashtags as extensions of the pattern.  The title text describes the two competing influences responsible for the cycle: The first impulse finds sigils useful to elucidate the type of the variable, especially when variable names are not very descriptive, while the latter impulse notes that descriptive variable names are much more useful for that purpose, especially in extensible languages where the built-in types form only a small part of the type system.","A sinusoidal curve is shown.

1312: Haskell,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1312:_Haskell,programming,The problem with Haskell is that it's a language built on lazy evaluation and nobody's actually called for it.,"The comic pokes fun at Haskell, a functional programming language. Functional programming languages are based on the mathematical concept of a function, that is two calls to a function always produce the same results given the same inputs. Side effects of a function call are changes to the program state or observable interactions with the outside world, other than returning a value. As a simple example, if a sum function changes a global variable, or prints the sum before returning it, those are side effects. Functions in most other languages frequently have side effects, typically making them hard to analyze. Functional programming languages seek to avoid side effects when possible. Pure functional programming language like Haskell push this agenda by isolating the inevitable side-effects (input/output at least) through the type system (more specifically in monads for Haskell).  The first joke says that Haskell only has no side effects because no one ever uses Haskell programs. Even in a traditional procedural programming language like C, if the program does not run it can't have side effects.  In Haskell effects are first class values. This means that you can use effects just like any value, assign them to a variable, pass them around, or manipulate them to make new and different effects. Thus, there are technically no side effects, only primary effects.  The title text is a joke about Haskell's lazy evaluation. The basic concept is that a value is not computed until it is actually used. Thus, it is possible to have a name representing the entire infinite list of Fibonacci numbers. However, until a particular element of the list is accessed, no work is actually done. The joke plays on ""called"" (referring to calling a function) vs. ""called for"" (requesting); thus Haskell may have value but no one has either invoked it to get that value or requested such a language. A simpler example may be:  The ""or"" function is defined as a normal function but can conclude instantly without computing the 10000th Fibonacci number (a daunting task) since this second parameter isn't necessary : ""true or whatever"" is always true.  In reality, Haskell is indeed actively used, though it is not one of the most popular languages. It is in particular used by some financial institutions, safety conscious start-ups and websites (there are several active web frameworks in Haskell) like Randall's own [1].",[Megan and Cueball are discussing.] Megan: Code written in Haskell is guaranteed to have no side effects. Cueball: ...because no one will ever run it?
1421: Future Self,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1421:_Future_Self,programming,Maybe I haven't been to Iceland because I'm busy dealing with YOUR crummy code.,"This comic is a joke about how the person you were in the past can be viewed as a distinct entity from who you are now, as well as the predictability of future events relating to your future actions.  The comic shows comments, informational notes left in the code that do not change the algorithm, from a project completed by Cueball some time ago that is still being used and maintained.  It is implied that Cueball is looking at these comments because the algorithm, a parsing function, is no longer working. These comments were written by Cueball's ""younger self"" in anticipation of being read by his ""older self"" at a date close to the present. The function has held up to the younger Cueball's expectations as it has lasted until the publication date of this comic, September 2014. The comments indicate a firm belief that the parsing function could not be easily ""re-kludged"" to handle the new situation but instead would need to be re-written. These comments are surprisingly accurate, leading Cueball to rhetorically reply to his younger self that these comments were creepy. Cueball's ""younger self"" must have anticipated a snarky reply and reminded his older self that his older self has likely not fulfilled his dream of going to Iceland. Cueball again replies that his younger self should stop judging him.   In the title text, current-day Cueball lashes out at his younger self, further emphasizing the way he is viewing his past self as a different person, blaming the ineffectiveness of his past self's coding for never going to Iceland.  A comment is a line, or a portion of a line, of code which should not be executed. A number of computer languages, including several popular ones, use ""#"" to indicate ""the remainder of this line is a comment"". The comment symbol tells the compiler to skip to the next line, ignoring everything after the symbol. Programmers make use of comments to leave notes about what a particular line or section of code is meant to do, places that require debugging, ideas for future revisions, etc.  The language in the comments is similar to how people address themselves in personal time capsules, in which they put letters away to read years later to see how much they've changed.  A ""parse function"" is code that interprets some form of input and makes sense of it in a way that enables functionality in some other part of the code. Parsers are commonly used to extract useful information from a source external to the algorithm.  Often parsing functions are written using regular expressions or in some other write-only language style. Parsing can be a difficult problem to solve, and programmers will often take shortcuts (perform kludges) based on assumptions on the kinds of input that the parsing function will have to handle, or possibly code through means of trial-and-error. As the programmer may not have control over the input, such as reading a page from someone else's web-site or using the output of an unpredictable program, an input that does not match the assumed the input syntax in can cause the parser to break, even if the parsing function has not changed.","[Cueball is sitting at a laptop, reading code.

1481: API,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1481:_API,programming,"ACCESS LIMITS: Clients may maintain connections to the server for no more than 86,400 seconds per day. If you need additional time, you may contact IERS to file a request for up to one additional second.","This comic presents a web site designed for human readers as if it had an API (application programming interface) designed for machine-to-machine web service. An API is a set of instructions about a computer program, intended to be used by developers of other computer programs, so the two programs can interoperate more easily. The documentation explains how to send commands to the program, and how the output will be returned.  Many web APIs are designed to return data in XML format. But in this case, the XML is XHTML, a version of the language that is used by all web pages. The ""requested data"" is the actual content (e.g. a blog post), and ""documentation"" refers (in an obscure way) to the parts of a web page that control how it looks on the screen (e.g. CSS and perhaps JavaScript layout code). The ""documentation"" may also be DTD which tells the XML parser info about this particular XML format, i.e. XHTML.   In order for a program to process a generic web site designed for human viewing, the program needs to use web scraping techniques, which often break when the web site design changes in subtle ways that a human might never notice. Therefore, developers prefer to have proper APIs with well-defined machine-readable formats, stable interfaces and documentation that actually describes the semantics of the data.  For example, Google has an official API for version 3 of their Youtube web service. But developers who don't want to hassle with the required API key or the costs associated with its use sometimes just scrape the regular YouTube web site. So someone could publish this comic with a YouTube URL as a convoluted hint to developers that there is an alternative to the official API.  The API keys section is a step-by-step description of how a web page is protected with HTTP Secure (HTTPS). The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol uses an elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key signed using Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption, which is stored in an X.509 certificate. Normally, the browser or operating system does this behind the scenes, so most web developers and users do not need to know these details.  The access limits mentioned in the title text says that the API can be used for 86,400 seconds each day. At first this may appear to be a strange arbitrary number, however it is in fact the total number of seconds in 24 hours, essentially meaning there is no limit on most days. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is the organization that decides when to add leap seconds, which account for slight anomalies in the Earth's rotation as compared to the mean solar day. These leap seconds will mean that the website is available for one extra second occasionally, although IERS decisions are based on actual Earth rotation rates and they of course wouldn't respond to requests for leap seconds in order to lengthen the number of seconds that a web site would be available for in a given calendar day.  The API does not discuss the issue that some days have 23 or 25 hours due to daylight saving time in the U.S. and summer time in Europe and some other places. This suggests that the web service tracks time via UTC.","[Cueball sitting at a desk staring at a computer screen.] API Guide Request URL format: http://~~~.com/<username>/<item ID>   Server will return an XML document which contains: The requested data.

1513: Code Quality,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1513:_Code_Quality,programming,I honestly didn't think you could even USE emoji in variable names. Or that there were so many different crying ones.,"This comic is the first in the Code Quality series, and is about the apprehension of asking for help from an expert who is a friend. Often we fear that we will be judged and they will think less of us, which is what occurs in this comic.  Ponytail is about to look at some source code Cueball has written, and he is warning her that he is self-taught so his code probably won't be written the way she is used to.  In spite of Ponytail's initial (polite) optimism, she comments in three increasingly harsh similes (and a fourth in the title text). The comic was later followed in 1695: Code Quality 2 and 1833: Code Quality 3, where Cueball is never shown on screen but only replies off-screen to four more even harsher comments (plus the title text ones), taking the total of her abusive comments up to 14!  First, she suggests that reading his code is like being in a house built by a child, using a small axe to put together what he thought was a house based on a picture. She is saying that the code shows a lack of command of the language being programmed. This is like the common expression ""if the only tool you have is a hammer, you'll treat everything as if it were a nail"". New programmers make use the same techniques repeatedly, making them fit for situations that they are not intended for.  Second, she suggests that it looks like a salad recipe, written by a corporate lawyer on a phone with autocorrect that only corrected things to formulas from Microsoft Excel. She is saying that the code is verbose and the corrections that were done are illogical. This presumably relates to the developer not being an expert in their craft, and fixing the problems as they come up instead of reexamining the problem and solving it in a better way.  Third, she describes it as a transcript of a couple arguing at IKEA, which was then randomly edited until the computer compiled it with no errors. She is saying that the intent of the code is unclear due to the seemingly random use of the language. This is very similar to an infinite amount of monkeys bashing away on typewriters for an infinite amount of time eventually producing the complete works of Shakespeare. (A couple's argument may be even less coherent at Ikea than at the average store, since Ikea products have idiosyncratic names that are difficult to pronounce or transcribe for anyone who doesn't speak Swedish.) This might happen if the code was written so bad that it does not compile, and people edited the code until it compiles so they can see what the code accomplishes. That Cueball's code is in this bad a shape indicates he really hasn't learned the programming language; he just happens to have a program that works in some shape or fashion.   Finally, Cueball makes the rather weak assurance that he will read ""a style guide"", which articulates the intended use of the language. It seems clear from Ponytail's commentary that his code quality would benefit from far more training in computer programming.  The title text refers to emoji. Ponytail's comment implies that some of Cueball's variables contained emoji, perhaps in an effort to capture the emotional content of the arguments which show through the requirements document. Emoji has become a recurrent theme on xkcd, but this may have been the first comic to use them for a pun.  Many crying-face emoji are possible if variables can include full Unicode (e.g., 😢,😭,😂,😪,😥,😰,😿,😹). In some programming languages it would be impossible to use them in variable names, as the symbols would break the language's syntax rules. Exceptions to this include Go, Swift and Perl ([1]), but most languages with compilers that support Unicode characters can include this kind of emoji, even for languages that predate Unicode like C++ and Lisp  In any event, Cueball's code may best be represented by a bunch of people crying, as that is the only proper response to it.  Although few programming languages require a perfectly rigid style, so long as the code is syntactically accurate, most programmers follow some sort of style to make the code easier to read. This includes indenting lines to show levels and using descriptive variable identifiers with special capitalization, (e.g., camelCase, capitalizing each word except for the first in a sentence, or snake_case, separating lowercase words with underscores).","[Cueball showing Ponytail his laptop.] Cueball: Keep in mind that I'm self-taught, so my code may be a little messy. Ponytail: Lemme see - I'm sure it's fine.  [Ponytail sits at desk, Cueball stand behind her.] Ponytail: ...Wow. This is like being in a house built by a child using nothing but a hatchet and a picture of a house.  [Ponytail sits at desk, Cueball stand behind her.] Ponytail: It's like a salad recipe written by a corporate lawyer using a phone autocorrect that only knew Excel formulas.  [Ponytail sits at desk, Cueball stand behind her.] Ponytail: It's like someone took a transcript of a couple arguing at IKEA and made random edits until it compiled without errors. Cueball: Okay, I'll read a style guide."

Maybe it's also inspired by Gary Bernhardt's CodeMash 2012 lightning talk on JavaScript's unpredictable typing. In the talk, the highly technical audience was unable to correctly guess the results of adding various JavaScript types and roared with laughter when they were revealed. The programming language shown in this comic has types even more unpredictable than JavaScript.  Most regular programming languages distinguish types, e.g. integers, strings, lists… all of which have different behaviours. But for instance, the operation ""+"" is usually conventionally defined over more than one of these types. Applied to two integers, it returns their sum.  Applied to two strings (denoted by being enclosed in quotes) it concatenates them:  > 2 + 35  > ""123"" + ""abc""""123abc""","[Caption above the black part of the comic:] My new language is great, but it  has a few quirks regarding type:  [The rest of the comic is written in a black rectangle.

1579: Tech Loops,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1579:_Tech_Loops,programming,"And when I think about it, a lot of ""things I want to do"" are just learning about and discussing new tools for tinkering with the chain.","The comic is about how much time a geek might spend on a computer just to maintain the system itself, rather than actually using it for something relevant. This can in the worst cases go all the way up to the point where maintaining the system becomes the main goal. Often the operating system (OS) needs periodic updates, which might break some apps which in turn need to be updated; apps themselves might need to be updated, which can create all sort of incompatibilities which the geek then needs to spend time fixing.  Most people consider computers as tools to achieve something else — e.g. to surf the web, play games, read news or balance their bank account — and they would rather not have to spend lots of time on maintaining the OS or the computer if they can avoid it.  Here, however, Randall finds he's spending most of the time using his computer just for the sake of maintaining the OS or the hardware on said computer. It's tools for the sake of tooling, rather than tools as helpers to build something else.  A hardware equivalent would be the RepRap Project: get a 3D printer and end up spending all the time printing 3D parts for itself instead of creating something else like toys or art.  An alternative interpretation is how a simple task can get maddeningly tricky because of the inherent complexity of the system. An example of this appears in 949: File Transfer, where the simple task of sending a file from one computer to another gets practically impossible despite having all kinds of cloud tools available, many of them designed to perform much more complex tasks with one simple click. In this view, the box labeled ""things I actually want to use my computer for"" could refer to simple actions like transferring a file and all the rest of the graph are unsuccessful tiring attempts to solve the problem by installing increasingly complex tools which end up not solving the simple problem properly. This is similar to this traditional programming joke.  In the title text Randall realizes that what he really wishes to do it often only to learn about and discussing new tools to improve the chain. So in this way it is for sure only a system to support itself. But on the other hand, then the box with things he actually wishes to use the computer for, is then not disconnected from the rest, but an integral part of it all.  Other comics about the same concept are 349: Success and 763: Workaround.  There are 18 boxes in the chart, but only 12 different texts. 16 of the boxes are interconnected. Two are not connected to any other boxes.  Here is a list of all the items explained individually:","[A flow chart 18 boxes linked (or not) with arrows going in several different directions.

1582: Picture a Grassy Field,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1582:_Picture_a_Grassy_Field,programming,"Wait, I can fix this. Picture another field. In the middle sits the only creature the first creature is afraid of. Now just-- wait, where did THAT one go?","In this comic Megan asks Cueball to picture himself in a grassy field. It is a standard technique to begin a visualization by asking the person to imagine that they are in some calm environment (could be for any kind of meditation/mindfulness like for instance yoga). A grassy field could have been replaced by a beach at the sea, or a forest with sunbeams coming down through the trees.  Proceeding with the visualization Megan asks Cueball to imagine a creature with the power to be able to escape from any visualized scene, and then tries to convince him that this creature has indeed escaped from his current visualization as it indeed would be able to do. She then proceeds by apologizing for this, but then tells him (warns him) that it from now on might appear in Cueball's daydreams, so he should begin looking out for it. This indicates that she is not at all sorry, but did this intentionally to try and mess with Cueball's head. The idea of the possibility of escaping an imagined situation was already used in 248: Hypotheticals. Now that Megan has introduced both the idea of the creature and the idea that it may appear in his daydreams, Cueball will almost certainly think of it from time to time, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.  In the title text Megan proposes a solution to get rid of the creature in Cueball's daydream, namely by picturing the only creature that the first fears. However, if this new (maybe quite scary) creature should be able to pursue the original creature, then it would also have to be able to move through visualized scenes just as easily. And this is what Megan pretends happens again. So now the problem is that Cueball has two creatures on the loose in his daydreams. And even if the second scares the first away, he would then still have the new one to worry about.","[Megan and Cueball are walking together.]  Megan: Picture a grassy field. Megan: In the center sits a small, pale, big-eyed creature with the power to escape from any visualized scene and move freely through the brain that imagined it. Megan: It glances around nervously and- Megan: -whoops, where'd it go? Megan: Sorry about that! Keep an eye out for it in your daydreams."
1597: Git,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1597:_Git,programming,"If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.","Git is a version control system, used to manage the code in many millions of software projects. It is very powerful, and was amongst the first widely adopted tools to use a distributed version control model (the ""beautiful graph theory tree model""), meaning that there is no single central repository of code. Instead, users share code back and forth to synchronise their repositories, and it is up to each project to define processes and procedures for managing the flow of changes into a stable software product.  Although very powerful, the command line of Git is notoriously difficult to learn and master. Dozens of blog posts and websites (see [1], [2]), and even books ([3], [4]) have been written to help users navigate this complexity.   The difficulty of using Git in common situations is belied by the apparent simplicity of its use in tutorial-style situations. Committing and sharing changes is fairly straightforward, for instance, but recovering from situations such as accidental commits, pushes or bad merges is difficult without a solid understanding of the rather large and complex conceptual model. For instance, three of the top five highest voted questions on Stack Overflow are questions about how to carry out relatively simple tasks: undoing the last commit, changing the last commit message, and deleting a remote branch.  This comic thus explores the difference between the idealised view of Git's architecture, and its actual typical usage. Tutorials for Git tend to use simple systems in their examples, and only deal with the most basic commands to get started, which can create the misleading impression that Git can be used effectively without extensive study.  Due to this problem, compounded by the fact that Git's commands are named differently from similar commands in other version control systems, many users (including Cueball) are unable to use it beyond basic commands, and might try to avoid problems by saving their code outside Git, downloading a newer copy, and then re-applying their changes to the new copy instead of trying to understand and use the features that exist in Git to accomplish this task.  Cueball suggests ""just memoriz[ing] these shell commands and type them to sync up"". He is probably referring to a sequence of commands such as:  As long as every contributor to the project follows these principles, this may suffice for a while. But many situations may cause ""errors"":  In a situation such as a merge conflict, Git will show an error message such as:  Although Git experts can of course deal with such situations, the remedy proposed by Cueball is ""save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy"". That is, to copy the files out of their local repository's working directory, delete that whole structure, then clone the remote repository again (and, implicitly, copy the saved work back again):  Abandoning the old project likely means losing some work, but may be faster and give a more predictable outcome than attempting to salvage the situation. Applying this method to a mere merge conflict issue may prolong the issue however, as the merge conflicts may still be present.  The title text suggests an alternative method for working around Git's complexities, which reflects common practice: knowing a ""Git expert"" who can help in any situation. Such experts are somewhat notorious for waxing lyrically about Git's strengths, so it may be necessary to win their favour by first letting them ramble enthusiastically about it. They will hopefully eventually give the exact commands needed. In practice, the question-and-answer site Stack Overflow is frequently used for this exact purpose.  It may even be a reference to the infamous tweet ""Git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space"" which has been discussed here but it is inconclusive whether a meaningful interpretation exists.  Putting a telephone number of someone who ""understands Git"" into such a file is humorous because:  In short: programmers use version control systems to track changes to code. Most of these version control systems are quite similar and easy to learn if you already know another one. Git is a version control system based on completely different principles, and most programmers find it difficult to wrap their heads around it (although Git also offers a large number of nontrivial benefits over standard version control systems, which is why it is used). Cueball is one of those programmers.  This comic is referenced on what if 153, the page where Randall, due to a problem with git, erroneously posted a draft of his what if? piece on peptides. As of December 17th, 2016 the page reads:  The comic 1296: Git Commit also features Git.","[Cueball points to a computer on a desk while Ponytail and Hairy are standing further away behind an office chair.] Cueball: This is git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree model. Ponytail: Cool. How do we use it? Cueball: No idea. Just memorize these shell commands and type them to sync up. If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy."
1605: DNA,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1605:_DNA,programming,"Researchers just found the gene responsible for mistakenly thinking we've found the gene for specific things. It's the region between the start and the end of every chromosome, plus a few segments in our mitochondria.","Because we have pretty much mapped the entire human genome, it's tempting to think we now know what makes our bodies tick and can start changing things. But just knowing what the individual pieces are, doesn't mean we know how they interact and behave in a complex system like our bodies.  In the comic, White Hat thinks that mapping the human genome is the same as knowing the source code for a computer program. By studying the source code for a program, a person can often understand why it does what it does, and make effective and fundamental changes to the program's operation. This may be a reference to the hyperbolic claims of Raymond Kurzweil, author of The Singularity is Near, that DNA is closely analogous to a computer program. Kurzweil believes that since we have sequenced DNA, we will soon be able to reverse engineer the brain and program a computer to completely simulate all its functions.  Megan points out that even a complete knowledge of DNA would only provide a partial understanding of our body's workings. Complete knowledge would require an understanding of feedbacks and external processing (such as the interactions of the proteins created by DNA). In addition the comparison is not valid because the human body is so many orders of magnitude more complicated than the computers we have running programs. White Hat is not persuaded, even though Megan points out that DNA has been developed in the most aggressive optimization process in the universe (natural evolution), running for billions of years. White Hat's thought process may be similar to the physicist in 793: Physicists who assumes that any other field is simple because it appears to be similar to something he's seen before.  Finally Megan enlightens White Hat by making him look at the source code for Google's front page. In a web browser, the page looks simple; a very plain white page with a search box in the middle plus a few text links and icons, and indeed back in the 1990s Google's HTML code for the page was quite simple. But in less than 20 years, Google developers have vastly expanded it, with over 300 kilobytes of minified Javascript and CSS.  Looking at some obfuscated source code may make it clearer how misleading even simple looking code can be, and how unreadable correct and well working code can be.  This analogy causes White Hat to consider how much more complexity could evolve over billions of years through the relentless forces of nature.  What makes this even worse with DNA is that although it can be thought of as 'source code' it isn't for a language we fully understand, and this code was generated through various natural mechanisms such as natural selection, feedback loops like homeostasis, etc.; possibly even including processes that are not currently known to science. Further, program maintainability is not an issue, so there is no reason for the code to be easy to understand. Additionally, there are many other non-genetic factors such as epigenetics, maternal effect and environment, which change how the genetic code is used. This means that not all parts make sense and that there may be all kinds of side effects and things that have several purposes.  The title text reference to finding the gene that is responsible ""for mistakenly thinking we've found the gene for specific things"" is a reference to the tendency of news organizations to run headlines making similar claims, often by oversimplifying or misrepresenting the actual study. These claims are based off the common belief that since DNA is a 'source code' for our body it should be possible to pin point the effect of individual genes in much the same way that we could describe the effect each line of code has in a very simple program; leading to people expecting one gene to be associated with each observable human trait. In reality even small traits are the results of hundreds of genes, sometime spread across multiple chromosomes, interacting through complex mechanisms; making it rare that a single gene, or gene sequence, can be definitively stated to be the sole, or primary, cause of a given trait.  The joke of the title text is that the responsible gene is located in the region between the start and the end of every chromosome meaning that the whole genome, not any one gene or DNA segment, must be considered responsible for the referenced trait, since the interconnected nature of DNA and environment during development means that every gene is at least partially responsible in generating any complex traits. Randall even includes the mitochondria, recognizing that the short DNA sequences present in these organelles, which are located outside the cell-nucleus, also contribute to development. The organismal chromosome or chromosomes are located in the nucleus, but mitochondria have their own tiny independent genome, reflecting their distant ancestry as separate but symbiotic organisms. This means that the DNA segments coding for any given human trait are not even necessarily all found on the main chromosomes in the nucleus.  Technically a gene is ""a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product"", which means that it is a single discrete unit of DNA, with human DNA containing over 20,000 genes. Thus the theoretical gene could not include the entire region between the start and the end of every chromosome since that region contains thousands of genes, any more than it's possible to say that the ace of clubs is the card everywhere from the top of the full deck of cards to the bottom of it.  Of course if such a gene actually did exist, then we would never be able to correctly identify where it was since we would make a mistake every time we thought we found a gene for something specific. So the whole title text is either a contradiction (they could never find this gene if it was there) and/or it is a tautology since if the gene did exist, then of course it has to be part of our entire DNA. (If it is a tautology it is the second title text using this in just two weeks, the last being 1602: Linguistics Club.)  Google's home page for the date this cartoon appeared can be seen at the internet archive: www.google.com homepage (18 Nov 2015).  Similar discussions between White Hat and Megan can be found in 1255: Columbus and 1731: Wrong.","[White Hat, holding a laptop, is talking to Megan who looks at her smart phone.] White Hat: Biology is largely solved. DNA is the source code for our bodies. Now that gene sequencing is easy, we just have to read it. Megan: It's not just ""source code"". There's a ton of feedback and external processing.

So far, this is a common expression of the way a sophisticated technology is built on simple building blocks, with one set of tools used to build a more powerful set of tools, and so on (see for instance this article: Tools to make Tools that make Tools).  However, the iterations are carried to comical lengths, with Megan spending twenty minutes reeling off various steps including development of software code and software code debugging and development tools. And she is not even finished when Cueball breaks into her endless list after she once again says tools for by asking what is it for? (See also: 1579: Tech Loops).  Megan readily admits that she doesn't even know the goal of these tasks, and guesses that it is probably for porn, referencing the not-entirely-unfounded stereotype that the majority of internet traffic is pornographic websites (see tvtropes the The Internet Is For Porn page). Knowing that many information technologies, from printing to computers, are quickly adopted by porn producers and distributors, this is not a bad guess on Megan's part. Further, many internet related advances have had their way paved by a porn industry that needed secure and secret payments options, and better bandwidth for downloading films, as well as making it more accessible, etc.   In the title text there is a recursion as someone (maybe Cueball) tells what they do.

1638: Backslashes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1638:_Backslashes,programming,"I searched my .bash_history for the line with the highest ratio of special characters to regular alphanumeric characters, and the winner was: cat out.txt | grep -o ""[[(].*[])][^)]]*$"" ... I have no memory of this and no idea what I was trying to do, but I sure hope it worked.","Most programming languages use the concept of a string literal, which is just a text between some delimiters, usually quotes. For example, ""Hello, world"" is a string literal. The text being represented is Hello, world without the quotes. However, the quotes are also written to mark the beginning and end of the string. This is a problem when the text itself contains a quote, as in ""This is a ""quoted"" string"". The quotes around the word ""quoted"" are intended to be part of the text, but the language processor will likely confuse it for the end of the string, which would thus be two strings with quoted outside these strings (probably resulting in a syntax error).  To avoid this problem, an escape character (usually a backslash) is prepended to non-string-terminating quotes. So, the previous text would be written as ""This is a \""quoted\"" string"". The language processor will substitute every occurrence of \"" with only the quote character, and the string terminates at the quote character which does not immediately follow a backslash. In this case the resulting text string would be This is a ""quoted"" string as intended.  However, the problem now is that the intended text might contain a backslash itself. For example, the text ""C:\"" will now be interpreted as an unterminated string containing a quote character. To avoid this, literal backslashes also are escaped with a second backslash, i.e. instead of ""C:\"" we write ""C:\\"", where the language processor interprets \\ as one single backslash and the quote terminates the string to give C:\ as the output.  This doubling of backslashes happens in most programming and scripting languages, but also in other syntactic constructs such as regular expressions. So, when several of these languages are used in conjunction, backslashes pile up exponentially (each layer has to double the number of slashes). See example of a backslash explosion and alternatives to avoid this below.  This kind of backslash explosion is known as Leaning toothpick syndrome, and can happen in many situations. Below is an explanation of all the entries in the comic.  The backslash explosion in the title text is about a bash command (which uses the backslash to escape arguments) invoking the grep utility which searches for text following a pattern specified by means of a regular expression (which also uses the backslash to escape special characters). This leads to 3 backslashes in a row in the command, which could easily become 7 backslashes in a row if the text being searched for also contains a backslash.  Even advanced users who completely understand the concept often have a hard time figuring out exactly how many backslashes are required in a given situation. It is hopelessly frustrating to carefully calculate exactly the number of backslashes and then noticing that there's a mistake so the whole thing doesn't work. At a point, it becomes easier to just keep throwing backslashes in until things work than trying to reason what the correct number is.  It's unclear whether the regular expression in the title text is valid or not. A long discussion about the validity of the expression has occurred here on this explanation's talk page. The fact that many editors of the site, often themselves extremely technically qualified[citation needed], can't determine whether the expression is valid or not, adds a meta layer to the joke of the comic. This is an example of nerd sniping (oh, the irony\!\!\!\).  A reasonable example of a backslash explosion would be a PHP script on a web server which writes JavaScript code with a Regular Expression to be run on the client. If the JavaScript code has to test a string to see if it has a double-backslash, the Regular Expression to do so would be:  where the first two backslashes represent a single backslash and the second two also represent a single backslash, so this searches for two consecutive back slashes. And the JavaScript would be:  where every two backslashes means just one backslashes in the string, so the 8 backslashes in JavaScript become 4 backslashes in the Regular Expression. However, since this JavaScript code is to be written through a PHP script, the PHP code would be:  where:  So, the presented scenario has escalated from a simple test for \\ to no less than seventeen backslashes in a row without stepping out of the most common operations.   If we go a bit further and try to write a Java program that outputs our PHP script, we'd have:  Here, we have 35 backslashes in a row: the first 34 produce the 17 we need in our PHP script, and the last one is for escaping the quote character. (This comes closer to The true name of Ba'al, the Soul-Eater).  Some programming languages provide alternative matching string literal delimiters to limit situations where escaping of delimiters is needed. Often, one can begin and end a string with either a single quote or a double quote. This allows one to write 'This is a ""quoted"" string' if double quote marks are intended in the string literal or ""This is a 'quoted' string"" if single quote marks are intended. Both kinds of delimiters can't be used in the same string literal, but if one needs to construct a string containing both kinds of quote marks one can often concatenate two string literals, each of which uses a different delimiter.  Another feature that seems to be popular in modern programming languages is to provide an alternative syntax for string delimiters designed specifically to limit leaning toothpick syndrome. For example, in Python, a string literal starting with r"" is a ""raw string""  [1] in which no escape processing is done, with similar semantics for a string starting with @"" in C#. This allows one to write r""C:\Users""  in Python or @""C:\Users"" in C# without the need to escape the backslash. This does not allow one to embed the terminating delimiter in the middle of the string and prevents the use of the backslash to encode the newline character as \n, but comes in handy when writing a string encoding of a regular expression in which the backslash is escaping one or more other punctuation characters or a shorthand character class (e.g., \s for a whitespace character). For example, when looking for an anchor tag in HTML, I may encode the regular expression as <[Aa]\s[^>]*>. If I express this regular expression as a raw string literal, my code looks like  r""<[Aa]\s[^>]*>"" instead of ""<[Aa]\\s[^>]*>"".

1646: Twitter Bot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1646:_Twitter_Bot,programming,PYTHON FLAG ENABLE THREE LAWS,"A Twitter bot is a program that can post automatically to Twitter. Although Twitter bots can be very elaborate, a lot of people write simple bots for fun that simply engage in automated wordplay.

The web searches he makes tell what happens next, i.e. the bot balloons in complexity until it starts following its own goals and Cueball no longer has any control over its actions.  This comic examines how a seemingly simple task can often balloon in complexity if all of the requirements are not understood, while at the same time presenting the stereotypical scenario where an unassuming idea results in the accidental creation of malevolent AI, which then attempts to destroy humanity.  The story, as told by the web searches, is as follows:","[Cueball is sitting at a desk using a laptop, his thoughts shown above in a thought bubble.

1654: Universal Install Script,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1654:_Universal_Install_Script,programming,"The failures usually don't hurt anything, and if it installs several versions, it increases the chance that one of them is right. (Note: The 'yes' command and '2>/dev/null' are recommended additions.)","Most users of computers today are used to simple, easy installation of programs. You just download a .exe or a .pkg, double click it, and do what it says. Sometimes you don't even have to install anything at all, and it runs without any installation.  However, when things are more ""homebrew"", for example downloading source code, things are more complicated.  Under Unix-like systems, which this universal install script is designed for, you may have to work with ""build environments"" and ""makefiles"", and command line tools. To make this process simpler, there exist repositories of programs which host either packages of source code and the things needed to build it or the pre-built programs. When you download the package, it automatically does most of the work of building the code into something executable if necessary and then installing it. However, there are many such repositories, such as ""pip"" and ""brew"", among others listed in the comic. If you only know the name of a program or package, you may not know in which repository(ies) it resides.  The install.sh file provided in the comic is a shell script, which attempts to fix this problem by acting as a ""universal install script"" that contains a lot of common install commands used in various Unix-like systems. This script in particular is interpreted by the Bourne Again Shell (Bash), which is denoted by the #!/bin/bash in the first line. In between each of the install commands in the script is the & character, which in POSIX-compatible shells (including Bash, a popular shell scripting language) means it should continue to run the next command without waiting for the first command to finish, also known as ""running in the background"". This has the effect of running all the install commands simultaneously; all output and error text provided by them will be mixed together as they are all displaying on the screen around the same time.  The script accepts the name of a program or package as an argument when you run it. This value is then referenced as ""$1"" (argument number 1). Everywhere the script says ""$1"", it substitutes in the name of the package you gave it. The end result is the name being tried against a large number of software repositories and package managers, and hopefully, at least one of them will be appropriate and the program will be successfully installed. Near the end, it even tries changing the current working directory to that which is assumed to hold the package to be installed, and then runs several commands which build the program from source code.  All in all, this script would probably work; it runs many standard popular repository programs and package managers, and runs the nearly-universal commands needed to build a program.  Most of the commands would simply give an error and exit, but hopefully the correct one will proceed with the install.  One of the more subtle jokes in the comic is the inclusion of apt-get and sudo apt-get in the same script. Good unix practice dictates never logging in as root; instead you stay logged in as your normal user, and run system admin accounts via sudo program name. This prevents accidental errors and enables logging of all sensitive commands. A side effect of this, however, is that an administrator may forget to prefix her command with sudo, and re-running it properly the second time. This is a common joke in the Linux community, an example of which can be found at viral tweet which shows a humorous workaround for the issue.  Since Randall's script does not use sudo for any but the apt-get command, there are two possibilities: the script itself was run via the root user or via sudo, in which case the sudo apt-get is not needed, or the script was run as a normal user, in this case the commands may install a local (as opposed to system-wide) version depending on local conditions. For instance npm will install a copy of the package under $HOME/.npm and pip would work as long as the user is working in a virtualenv (which is standard practice for Python developers).  Sudo has also been used both by Randall in 149: Sandwich and by Jason Fox to force Randall to let him appear on xkcd with 824: Guest Week: Bill Amend (FoxTrot).  The tool curl downloads files from the network (e.g., the Internet). For example, curl http://xkcd.com/ downloads and displays the xkcd HTML source. The pipe | in the script attaches the output of the command before the pipe to the input of the command after the pipe, thus running whatever commands exist in the web content. Although this ""curl|sh"" pattern is a common practice for conveniently installing software, it is considered extremely unwise; you are running untrusted code without validation, there may be a MITM who modifies the code you receive, or the remote system could have been hijacked and the code made malicious. Most local package managers (e.g. apt, yum) offer digitally-signed packages that thwart this problem. You can find many examples of software providers suggesting a curl|sh solution at curlpipesh  There appears to be a bug with the & at the end of the ""git clone"" line; since a git repository typically contains program source code, not executables, it may have been intended to retrieve the source code with git and then compile and install the program in the next line. In this case, the single & should be replaced with &&, an operator that will run the second command only if the first one has completed successfully. This plays into a second bug on the ""configure"" line, where the placement of the & means that only the ""make install"" command will be run asynchronously after the ""configure"" and ""make"" steps have finished in sequence (though this would likely fail due to a lack for write permissions unless it was run with sudo). To make success as likely as possible, the two lines should be like this or script should be executed twice:  Since all commands are running in the background, any command that requires user input will stop and wait until brought to the foreground. A common request would be for a database password, or if it is allowed to restart services for the installation. This could lead to packages being only partly installed or configured. (See more about using ""yes"" below.)  The title text mentions the possibility that the same program may be in multiple repositories, so in this case, the script will download and install several versions, or it may fail on a number of repositories, in which case usually nothing bad happens. Since all the commands come from different operating systems, versions, or distributions, it is not very likely that more than one will work (with the exception of pip/easy_install and the two forms of apt-get) or even exist on the same system. It mentions that adding a way of automatically saying ""yes"" to questions asked during the different repository-fetching programs' running, by making them read input from another program that writes a (nearly) endless stream of ""y""s, could simplify things further. This would not work for any curses-based menus, or to answer any more complicated questions. Adding 2>/dev/null to a command redirects the second output stream (the ""error stream"") to the null device driver, which discards all writes to it, meaning errors (the package not existing) will not be sent to the screen.","[In the panel is a shell script which, unusual for xkcd, uses only lower case.

1667: Algorithms,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1667:_Algorithms,programming,"There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control.","An algorithm is a basic set of instructions for performing a task, usually on a computer. This comic lists some algorithms in increasing order of complexity, where complexity may refer to either computational complexity theory (a formal mathematical account of the computational resources – primarily computation time and memory space – required to solve a given problem), or the more informal notion of programming complexity (roughly, a measure of the number and degrees of internal dependencies and interactions within a piece of software).  At the simplest end is left-pad, or adding filler characters on the left end of a string to make it a particular length. In many programming languages, this is one line of code. This is possibly an allusion to a recent incident when NodeJS Package Manager angered a developer in its handling of a trademark claim. The developer unpublished all of his modules from NPM, including a package implementing left-pad. A huge number of programs depended on this third-party library instead of programming it on their own, and they immediately ceased to function.  Quicksort is an efficient and commonly used sorting algorithm.  Git is a version control program, i.e., software that allows multiple people to work on the same files at the same time. When someone finalizes (""commits"") their changes, the version control program needs to join the new content with the existing content. When more than one person has made overlapping changes at the same time, the process of figuring out how to join them is called merging, and the algorithm for it is anything but simple.  A self-driving car is an automobile with sensors and software built into it so that it can maneuver in traffic autonomously, i.e. without a human controller. Various companies have been working on such vehicles for many years now, and while they're further along now than would have been imaginable even a couple of years ago, we're still far away from the dream of hopping in a driver-less taxi and sitting back as the car itself navigates to where we want to be. Recently Randall has made several references to self-driving cars which has become a recurring topic on xkcd.  The Google Search backend is what enables you to type ""what the heck is a leftpad algorithm"" into your browser and have Google return a list of relevant results, including correcting ""leftpad"" to ""left-pad"", truncating ""what the heck is"" to simply ""what is"", and sometimes even summarizing the findings into a box at the top of the results. Behind all that magic is a way to remember what pages the Internet contains, which is just a mind-bogglingly large quantity of data, and an even more mind-numbingly complex set of algorithms for processing that data.  The last item is the punchline: a sprawling Excel spreadsheet built up over 20 years by a church group in Nebraska to coordinate their scheduling. Spreadsheets are a general end-user development programming technique, and therefore people use Excel for all sorts of purposes that have nothing to do with accounting (its original purpose), including one guy who made a role-playing game that runs in Excel; but even that doesn't approach the complexity that develops when multiple people of varying levels of experience use a spreadsheet over many years for the purpose of coordinating the schedule of several coordinated groups.  The scheduling of tasks over a group of resources (a.k.a. the nurse scheduling problem), while respecting the constraints set by each person, is a highly complex problem requiring stochastic or heuristic methods for its resolution. Here, the algorithm would be further complicated by being solved by inexpert users over a spreadsheet model without using engineering practices. The potential hyperbole here is in thinking that such combination of circumstances would produce complexity far over that required to drive a car or sort the public contents of the Internet. While most churches meet mainly on Sunday morning, scheduling of what happens during the service when (especially if there are multiple concurrent services) as well as Sunday School, church business meetings, and congregation-wide events all potentially needing to be scheduled on a particular Sunday morning, the need to find a solution very close to the best possible solution quickly becomes a dire need. Furthermore, with different members involved in a wide variety of activities within and outside of the church, and the classrooms available to the church on Sunday itself, (just scheduling the choir practice times to coordinate with everyone's work schedules is very possibly impossible, especially if two people share the same occupation, and one is the relief for the other,) can indeed be daunting. In addition, there would likely be assorted committee meetings and youth groups during the week.  In the title text, part of the spreadsheet's complexity is described as originating from different versions of the file for different programs. The words used like schism and sect are normally used in context of religions splitting into groups about differences in beliefs. In this case, the split seems to have been not over a theological issue, but about the use of open-source vs. proprietary software, disagreements about which are often compared to religious debates. Most likely, the schism being referred to is the East-West Schism of 1054.  The title text also implies that while trying to reconcile after the schism and to merge the two schedules they reinvented an alternative to Git within the spreadsheet itself, making the algorithms in place at least as complicated as that. Since most spreadsheet programs have a sort algorithm built in, that aspect is implied too, and left-padding could be compared to vamping on an introduction to a hymn. This would indicate that the other milestones of complexity are either included in the current version of the spreadsheet or are planned to be implemented.

1671: Arcane Bullshit,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1671:_Arcane_Bullshit,programming,"Learning arcane bullshit from the 80s can break your computer, but if you're willing to wade through arcane bullshit from programmers in the 90s and 2000s, you can break everyone else's computers, too.","When fixing/improving an existing computer program, programmers sometimes need to read, understand, and improve old code. The older a piece of code is, the less it tends to conform to modern programming practices, and the more likely it is to be ""arcane bullshit"" from the perspective of a 21st Century programmer.  Randall seems to feel that willingness to deal with ""arcane bullshit"" is a ""Catch 22"" that prevents 80s arcane bullshit from being fixed. Someone completely unwilling to deal with arcane bullshit would lack the patience to learn how to program. Someone extremely willing to wade through an 80s programmer's arcane bullshit is likely to ""nerd snipe"" (356: Nerd Sniping) themselves into fiddling with kernels (which are inherently arcane bullshit) instead of making useful code. Cueball is in the middle of the scale: smart and patient enough to make the 80s bullshit worse, but not smart and patient enough to know how to fix it.  This comic could be a reference to changes in programming methodologies. As the first computer programs were written in the 40's and 50's they were prone to becoming ""spaghetti code"", where the flow of execution would jump from one part of the program to another using the JUMP which gives no state information. While this method of programming can work very quickly, it makes it difficult to predict program flow and can create interdependencies that are not obvious. In the BASIC language JUMP was called GOTO and the courses for new programmers argued that using GOTO in all but trivial cases was a very bad idea. On the other hand, old programmers argued that calculated GOTO was a sexy way of programming.  To combat the problem computer scientists have relied on increasing the levels of abstraction and encapsulation, by developing structured programming, procedural programming, and OOP (object oriented programming).  In structured programming you break your program into well defined blocks of code with specified entry and exit points. Using the stack (a portion of memory dedicated to storing information / program state) it is possible to call a block of code and then have that block of code return control to the point that called it after it has done what was requested.  Very quickly it was decided to mark these blocks of code as functions or procedures, making it a lot easier to know how to call the blocks and edit them. Languages that made this a focus include Pascal, Modula, and C.  Structured and procedural programming were well entrenched in the 80's. Most systems programming was done in mid- or low-level languages, which to improve performance don't do much to control access to the data structures in the programs. Because they are low level the code requires many steps to do seemingly easy things like draw a box on a screen, making it hard for a non-experienced programmer to understand what is happening.  Although the idea of OOP was around as early as the 1950's, it was not implemented in a widespread fashion until the 1990's. OOP encapsulates the data structures inside of functions, so rather than manipulate the variable directly you call the data structure and tell it to do something. This additional level of abstraction can make it a lot easier to work on varied data. It also can protect the program data from unexpected changes by other sections of the program.  Because code in the 80's was typically done at a much lower level, it can be hard for programmers used to having the language and libraries do more work for them. It also meant that programmers would often hard code expectations into their source code such as the number of files that can be opened at once, or size of the operating system disk buffers, rather than make them configurable while the program is running, or even while it was being loaded. This means if you need the program to handle a larger file, you might need to recompile it after finding and changing all the places in the code that assume the smaller max file size.  As such, few people are willing to try to surpass the massive barrier to learning. This group is on the left. To the right are people who have gotten so used to the tools and conventions of the 80's that they spend all of their time adjusting and recompiling the kernel of their computers to match their current needs, instead of actually creating new programs.  In the center is Cueball, presumably representing Randall, who has learned enough to try and fix code, but not enough for his fixes to actually work.  As programs age, they often lose support from the initial project head and die out, no longer supported on new computers. So, as the title text says, learning more coding from the '90s and after is necessary for also breaking everyone else's computers.  This could also be a comment on hacking and the advent of the internet and the technologies behind that (TCP/IP, HTML, CSS, PHP...) being 90s/2000s. Computers in the 80s were typically stand alone so what you are learning can only be applied to your machine. To break everyone else's you need to understand networking.  The title text might be a reference to various recently discovered security vulnerabilities in open-source software. In some cases, underskilled programmers have provided flawed code for critical infrastructure with very little review, resulting in global computer security disasters. Randall described some of these in 424: Security Holes (2008), 1353: Heartbleed and 1354: Heartbleed Explanation (2014). Other recent examples include Shellshock and vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel involving the perf and keyrings subsystems.",[A horizontal graph with arrows pointing left and right with labels.

1685: Patch,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1685:_Patch,programming,"My optimizer uses content-aware inpainting to fill in all the wasted whitespace in the code, repeating the process until it compiles.","Adobe Photoshop is a commonly used application for image manipulation. One of its features is the Patch tool, which allows the user to overwrite parts of the image, replacing them with a copy of another area of the same image. It is often used for “patching up” photographs by overwriting scratches or other visible damage to the photo. Another of Photoshop’s features is “content-aware fill”, which could also be described as “content-aware inpainting”. It works similarly to the Patch tool, but automatically generates a replacement texture from the area surrounding the deleted part instead of copying a user-specified area exactly.  GNU patch is a program that replaces only parts of code with an updated version, without requiring the user to download the entire source code. Here, it appears the author was told to “patch” the code, but used Photoshop to do this instead of GNU patch, with devastating results. Although the title text suggests that if you did this enough times the code would eventually compile, this would never happen. In fact, Photoshop could only edit an image of the text and not the text itself. However, it could work if optical character recognition (OCR) were integrated into the workflow as well.  The comic blurs the difference between text (in which letters and symbols represent discrete values, such as 65 being the number for the letter A in the ASCII encoding standard, and it's relatively easy for a program compiler to interpret combinations of these values as keywords and other programming constructs) and graphics (where the letters and symbols in the comic are actually represented by a pattern of colored dots), playing with the idea that the patch metaphor can be used on both (although with different meanings). There are common and straightforward processes for converting text information to images, such as printing, which can convert text to a graphics format very faithfully. The reverse, however, requires the use of optical character recognition (OCR), which attempts to figure out which letter or symbol certain patterns of dots ""look like"". OCR could be effective in converting some of the image in the comic back to usable text, however it would fail on some of those patterns that have been mangled and don't look like any existing characters or symbols. A compiler can only operate on text data, so converting the graphic back into text would be a requirement to even begin to attempt to compile it, a step omitted in the title text.  The code appears to be written in Python, a programming language often referred to in xkcd, such as in 353: Python. A few of the function names that can be recognized are ""isPrime"" and ""quicksort"", both elementary programming algorithms. It was also apparently originally edited using a Python-aware programming text editor, which is able to use different colors for different programming elements. For example, it appears to use red for keywords, blue for variables, and black for other elements, however because of the mangling from the use of the wrong patching program, that doesn't appear to be consistent. Since the patching replaced graphical elements rather than whole characters, there are examples of symbols that are combination of two different characters, and when the original two characters were rendered in different colors the resulting non-character could be in two colors, or the resulting ""word"" might be rendered in multiple colors.  The comic brings to attention the high rate of Adobe Photoshop piracy. GNU Patch is available for free, even for Windows, and Mac OS X. So the comic implies that Adobe Photoshop, subscription to which costs $20/month, is more available than GNU patch. According to this poll, 58% of Photoshop copies were pirated.  The title text also explains that patch used the content-aware inpainting to fill in all the wasted whitespace in the code. In most programming languages, whitespace is necessary to separate words, so this would combine words that shouldn’t be combined and create invalid code. Since the code in the image is Python, the code will be messed up even more, because Python uses whitespace as a part of its programming syntax. For example, statements are separated by new lines instead of by semicolons (;), and indentation is used instead of brackets to determine the scope of each section of code.  The original code was likely as follows:  isPrime and quicksort are standard python implementations of simple algorithms (although you would not generally write a sorting algorithm in python as there are built-in algorithms available).  isPrimeRegex uses the re module to detect if a number is prime by seeing if a string containing that many 1s can be matched to 2 or more copies of some string containing at least 2 1s.  The comic two comics back 1683: Digital Data, also related to turning digital data into bad copies. Less than a month before quicksort was mentioned in 1667: Algorithms, and a month before that another ""easy"" solution to a programming problem was released in 1654: Universal Install Script.  Using a Photoshop tool for a task it is not intended for was also used in 1784: Bad Map Projection: Liquid Resize, where Photoshop's content aware resizing tool was a very questionable choice to use for a Map Projection.","[The panel displays part of a code, in five different colors (red, purple, light blue, blue and green) as well as normal black text, which due to image editing is difficult to read.

1692: Man Page,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1692:_Man_Page,programming,"For even more info, see blarbl(2)(3) and birb(3ahhaha I'm kidding, just Google it like a normal person.","This comic shows a Unix manual page, i.e. a man page (hence the title), for a fictional program called ""blerp"". Unix man pages are meant to provide a brief reference on the usage of a command, not extended explanations with tutorials as may be found in many hardcopy product manuals. Unfortunately, some Unix commands tend to be very bloated and include lots of optional behavior that is often irrelevant to the original intent of the command and can be done much more easily using shell features like piping and redirection, and thus the manpage grows to explain all of the features. This example exaggerates the obscurity and terseness found in many man pages, making fun of the typical style of the genre.  It follows the prescribed format for a man page, with the following sections:  For comic effect, most of this particular man page is not meaningful, and sometimes doesn't obey the expected syntax.  The Synopsis section is supposed to be in a regex-like language called Wirth Syntax Notation, with structures like  But the two Synopsis lines given do not have valid Wirth syntax; they randomly mix objects and syntactic characters, and the brackets and braces are not properly nested or paired.  The Description section provides an unhelpful summary that could apply to almost any Unix command. Processing input files (or output of other commands in a pipeline) is a generic function for Unix shell tools, as is specifying their behaviour with command line arguments, environment variables and flags. The text leaves to the reader's imagination what the program actually does, and what behavior the various options modify, which gives maximum scope for humorous possibilities.  The options are in conventional alphabetical order, except that lower case is placed before upper case, and an em-dash is inserted between b and c.  Command-line options, also known as flags, are typed after the program's name to change how the program runs. For example, a user of blerp might type:  blerp -a -d -t -p ""AVIGNON""  According to the man page, this would run blerp in attack mode, piping its output to DEBUG.EXE, with tumble dry, and the true Pope set to ""AVIGNON"". In most cases, any number of flags can be used in any order, and flags can be followed by argument (such as ""AVIGNON"" in this example).  For a walkthrough of all possible flags see the table of flags below.  Below the flags there is a see also list with other ludicrous program names (blirb, blarb and blorp), each followed by a number in parentheses. This is a common way to refer to a command in Unix environments, where the number denotes the documentation section the program is found in. This serves to disambiguate man pages with the same name, in this instance those for the blerp command (section 1, ""General commnds"") and the blerp() C library function (section 3, ""C library functions"").  It is unknown which section the man page in this comic resides in. It looks like it could be in section 1, ""General commans"", which would make it self-referential. Section numbers only go up to 8, so blarb(51) is not a valid section number. The last blorp(501)(c)(3) is not a valid section number either, it is however a slightly covert reference to 501(c)(3) which is an organization that is tax-exempt.  Then follows a bug report site. www.inaturalist.org is a site working to extend biological research, and the exact address given, http://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47744-Hemiptera, points to the same page as http://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/Hemiptera. Hemiptera is the order classifying true bugs, making it a good place to report any biological bugs discovered while running a program (Like the bees found without using -b.) Insects got into some early computers, causing them to malfunction, and hence computer malfunctions are often called ""bugs"".  Finally there is a ""copyright"" line which references several variously open-source content licenses, which is a recurring theme on xkcd (see 225: Open Source).

A few comics have been released under the CC-BY-SA license or 3.0. BSD refers to BSD licenses, another recurring theme in xkcd. ""Like Gecko"" is a reference to a web browser user-agent string; modern user-agent strings include a lot of text designed to allow browsers to masquerade as different browsers/renderers, and ""(like Gecko)"" is the standard text for a browser that wants to be treated as if it were Gecko while admitting, if you look closely, that it isn't really Gecko. This copyright line, which includes a lot of mashed-together text that might appear to match any of several different licenses, resembles a user agent string.  ""Or best offer"" is usually seen on a notice of a private sale, where it proclaims the intent to be flexible on asking price in the hope of expediting the sale, with a suggestion that the seller will sell to the highest bidder even if the offer is nowhere near the asking price. In the context of the comic, it suggest that the rights for the program are available for purchase by anyone who makes the ""best"" offer. Since the other licenses listed would allow free usage without incurring any royalty charge, it would be pointless to buy the rights to this program. It is possible to revoke the other licenses though. Perhaps the program's creator is suggesting the rights could be given to someone making him a different sort of offer, perhaps romantic or sexual?  In the title text there is a list with even more info, again with silly names like blarbl and birb. Again there are section numbers. While writing about birb, and without bothering to close the brackets around (3), the writer breaks off to laugh at the reader, telling them that he is kidding and suggesting that they just Google it like a normal person. The implication is that anyone trying to pick through a man page to find out what a program does is going the long way round, when it's much simpler to get Google to tell you.  Man pages were part of the subject of 293: RTFM, 912: Manual Override and 1343: Manuals and were mentioned in 434: xkcd Goes to the Airport and 456: Cautionary.",[A terminal screen; the background is black and the text is white.]
1695: Code Quality 2,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1695:_Code_Quality_2,programming,It's like you tried to define a formal grammar based on fragments of a raw database dump from the QuickBooks file of a company that's about to collapse in an accounting scandal.,"The comic is a continuation of 1513: Code Quality the first Code Quality series, in which we see Ponytail being introduced to the source code Cueball has written, and where he is warning her that he is self-taught so his code probably won't be written the way she is used to. In the first comic she continues to describe poetically the total mess of a code she encounters, using references to a child building houses, recipes created by corporate lawyers or the transcript of a couple arguing at IKEA, as well as using emojis in the code (title text).  In this comic she continues this trend in four more abusive comments, after starting this sequel with a short remark on how she hates reading Cueball’s code. Cueball is not even shown in this comic, only replying twice off-panel, but as the title makes it clear this is a sequel there can be no doubt that it is Cueball. With the four remarks here as well as a fifth in the title text, she has now managed to make no less than nine derogatory remarks on Cueball's programming skills.  In the second panel Ponytail makes a reference to ""OCR"" (Optical Character Recognition), a technique for recognizing text in a picture using software. In this case she is referring to a picture of a Scrabble game, which is a popular word-making game in which players have a pseudo-randomized set of letters and must arrange them on a grid to form interlocking words. OCR software is notoriously imperfect at the time of writing, and the criss-crossing semi-random words on a Scrabble board fed through an OCR program would likely produce dubious results, certainly not fit for current code standards.  Ponytail observes that Cueball’s code includes the JavaScript reserved words more often than a typical Scrabble board would, a concession that the code looks at least vaguely code-like. Reserved words such as ‘function’, ‘if’ and ‘return’ are fundamental building blocks of code, and most code uses them often. (They are called “reserved” because those words are reserved for their actual meanings such as defining a function – programmers may not create variables with those names.) As for why “triple points” translates to a prevalence of those words, Scrabble's point system is based on the value of individual letters, combined with certain modifier squares on the game board which can boost points. ""Triple points"" is the highest class of modifier available in the game (though it can be for triple points on a specific letter, or the entire word) and is highly-sought-after by players.  The third panel continues Ponytail's rant, this time referencing naval weather forecasts, avian interference and indentation. A weather forecast is a complex, multidimensional array of data used in predicting or assessing the atmospheric conditions of a geographical area over a set time. Naval weather forecasts use an extremely condensed code to send their information, rendering them unintelligible to an untrained reader. Transcribing it would be further complicated by a woodpecker (a bird noted for its rapid successive pecking motions) ""hammering"" (pecking) the Shift key on the keyboard, which would result in many letters being randomly capitalized. Indentation is the practice of shifting a section of text further from the starting margin, which in coding is typically used to organize functions and statements, but if done ""randomly"" would only serve to scramble the code hierarchy.  The fourth panel references famous poet E. E. Cummings and user name suggestions. Edward Estlin Cummings was a poet who used capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks in unconventional ways. Websites that offer membership often also require that users create a pseudonym (known as a ""username"") for use in tracking/authenticating their actions on the site, as well as identifying them to the site's community. Many of these sites also require usernames be unique. On popular sites, many common words, phrases and names have already been reserved by users, so when signing up for them many people run into situations where the name they want has already been taken. On many sites where this happens, the site may suggest alternate usernames, usually based on the one that was entered to begin with. For example, if the username ""Hedgeclipper"" is already reserved, the site may recommend ""Hedgeclipper1234"" or ""H3dg3clipp3r"" instead, depending on the algorithm behind the suggestions. In other cases, websites requiring users to enter personal information such as their name may suggest a username based on their name with a string of digits after it, such as ""Joshua1128"". An E. E. Cummings poem written entirely out of these semi-random suggestions would make the resulting poem even more ""unusual"" than his work is already considered.  The last panel's simile involves Markov chaining, chat-bots (presumably), bus schedules and potential gross vehicular negligence. Applied Markov chaining is a process used in many computer algorithms that try to simulate real-world concepts such as speech simulation and decisions-making. Its inherent randomness also makes it a candidate for unpredictable things such as stock market analysis and speech recognition. Bus schedules are often complicated and full of notation, and are notorious for confusing people who are not used to reading them. Chat-bots using applied Markov chains to recognize and respond to speech/text rely on the input being clear and well-organized in plain language. ""Feeding"" bus schedules to such a bot would likely result in the returns being complete gibberish and unreadable. The issue is further complicated when Ponytail suggests that the schedules are from a city where ""the buses crash constantly"", which would be horrifying if it happened so regularly that the schedules actually took crashes into account. Even more horrifying would be the further unpredictability of the output of the chat-bot from such unpredictable input.  Cueball finally comments that ""… it runs fine for now"" which indicates he knows the code has problems but it reluctant to fix them because it's more-or-less serving its function. Ponytail quips back that ""So does a burning bus"", which is technically true, but the ""for now"" part implies that disaster and injury could result at any moment, as would likely happen on a burning bus.  In the title text Ponytail makes a final remark. A formal grammar is a way of describing the structure of text such that computers can recognize or generate such text. A raw database dump is an export of the data from a database for the purposes of transferring it to another database or importing it into a program, viewed “raw” without processing to make it easy for humans to read. QuickBooks is an accounting software package. The company collapsing in an accounting scandal implies their accounting database would be a mess even in a human-readable format.","[Zoom in on Ponytail sitting in front of a computer screen typing. Cueball speaks only off-panel, but since this is a direct continuation of comic 1513: Code Quality where Cueball is shown, there can be no doubt it is him.] Ponytail: Ugh, I hate reading your code. Cueball (off-panel): I know, I know.  [Zoom out of Ponytail in an office chair in front of the computer on a desk.] Ponytail: It's like you ran OCR on a photo of a Scrabble board from a game where Javascript reserved words counted for triple points.

1700: New Bug,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1700:_New_Bug,programming,"There's also a unicode-handling bug in the URL request library, and we're storing the passwords unsalted ... so if we salt them with emoji, we can close three issues at once!","Cueball asks if an off-panel character can look at his bug report. The person asks if it's a ""normal one"" and not a ""horrifying"" one which proves that the entire project is ""broken beyond repair and should be burned to the ground"". This implies that there have been reports of the ""horrifying"" variety in the past.  Cueball promises that it is a normal one but it turns out that the server crashes when a user's password is a resolvable URL, which implies that the server is in some way attempting to resolve passwords as if they were URLs. A resolvable URL is one that is syntactically correct and refers to a find-able and accessible resource on the internet (i.e. does not return a 404 error or equivalent when resolved). Therefore a resolvable URL is a fully qualified domain name or a valid ip address that points to a valid server, and it can optionally specify a resource that exists on that server. Normally there is no reason for a system to treat a password as if it were a URL.  Also, Cueball specifically states that the server is crashing, rather than his application. While this could be an example of misused terminology on the part of Cueball or Randall, given Cueball's history (for example causing the most basic console commands to fail in 1084: Server Problem or other tech issues as seen in 1586: Keyboard Problems) his choice of terms is probably accurate. In the context of web services the server refers to either the computer itself or the program that responds to web requests and executes the user's (i.e. Cueball's) application. Cueball would be in charge of building the application. The importance of this distinction is that a typical system has safe guards in place at many levels to prevent a misbehaving application from crashing anything other than itself. So for his application to crash the server (either the computer itself or the server software hosting his application) would require his application to be operating in a way far outside of the norm, which has been the case for Cueball in previous comics. Alternatively, the project might include its own server software without the safeguards. In either case it is clear that Cueball's issue is far from normal, for which reason the off-panel person gives up and decides that burning the project to the ground is the only solution, telling Cueball I'll get the lighter fluid.  In the title text another two issues with Cueball's program are mentioned, together with a possible solution that would fix all three problems at once. The second problem is a unicode-handling bug in the URL request library, and the third is that the passwords are stored unsalted. The proposed solution is to salt the passwords with emoji (unicode, multi-byte characters), which is claimed to solve all three issues at once. Salting passwords means that random characters are added to the password before it is cryptographically-secured and stored in the database. Salting increases security in the event that the database is compromised by ensuring that users with the same password will not have the same password hash. This makes some attacks that can be used to crack hash databases, such as rainbow tables, effectively impossible.  Salting passwords with emoji can potentially ""fix"" these bugs in different ways. First, emoji and other unicode characters are not valid characters in URLs. As a result the salted-passwords will no longer be resolvable URLs. This will presumably circumvent (but not actually fix) the bug that causes the server to crash. In addition, the passwords will now be salted, increasing security. There is no obvious way that this would actually fix a unicode-handling bug in the URL request library. Given Cueball's general approach to problems like this, the best explanation is probably that he hasn't ""fixed"" the bug but rather that it is no longer a bug because he is relying on its behavior to help fix these other issues, i.e. the classic it's not a bug, it's a feature.  The title text shows that his general approach to problems is not to actually fix bugs but to work around them and even rely on them for other behavior. This approach to software development makes for terrible code, which is likely how Cueball got into this trouble in the first place. Therefore the title text shows that he still has yet to learn from his mistakes, further supporting the suggestion to just burn the whole thing down.  Given that this comic comes only five comics after 1695: Code Quality 2 it seems likely that the off-panel person is Ponytail and as could be seen in the first of those two comics, 1513: Code Quality, the perpetrator is indeed Cueball. In the title text of the first, using emoji in variable names is mentioned. Emoji has since then become a recurrent theme on xkcd.  In 1349: Shouldn't Be Hard Cueball is also programming and finding it very difficult, although he thinks it should be easy. An off-panel person suggests burning the computer down with a blowtorch, much like the off-panel person in this one suggests burning the whole project (including the computer) to the ground with lighter fluid. In the next comic, with multiple storylines 1350: Lorenz, one story line results in a computer being burned with a blow torch.","[Cueball sits at his desk in front of his computer leaning back and turning away from it to speak to a person off-panel.] Cueball: Can you take a look at the bug I just opened? Off-panel voice: Uh oh.  [Zoom out and pan to show only Cueball sitting on his chair facing away from the computer, which is now off-panel. The person speaking to him is still of panel even though this panel is much broader.] Off-panel voice: Is this a normal bug, or one of those horrifying ones that prove your whole project is broken beyond repair and should be burned to the ground?  [Zoom in on Cueball's head and upper torso.] Cueball: It's a normal one this time, I promise. Off-panel voice: OK, what's the bug?  [Back to a view similar to the first panel where Cueball has turned towards the computer and points at the screen with one hand.] Cueball: The server crashes if a user's password is a resolvable URL. Off-panel voice: I'll get the lighter fluid."
1739: Fixing Problems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1739:_Fixing_Problems,programming,"What was the original problem you were trying to fix?' 'Well, I noticed one of the tools I was using had an inefficiency that was wasting my time.'","Due to the complex relationships within a program or other system, making an alteration can cause problems with other parts of the program. This can lead to a seemingly small ""fix"" becoming a long chain of debugging and consecutive fixes, which Cueball is in the middle of, a typical example of recursion often used in xkcd. As Cueball attempts to solve the initial computer issue, he creates more problems along the way. So he should have followed the golden rule: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  The title text suggests that the original problem was not stopping the function of the program and the benefits that Cueball may have hoped to achieve with the mentality of ""If it ain't broke, break it and fix it"" are being consumed by the expanding effort of the fix.  Attempting to solve all of these problems results in more time wasted than he hoped would be gained by optimizing the inefficient tool described in the title text. Though depending on the tool, he could publish the changes once completed, allowing the community using that tool to gain back the man-hours collectively. Wondering if something is worth doing has been a subject in 1205: Is It Worth the Time?  This comic is similar in thesis to 1445: Efficiency and 1319: Automation. Other relevant comics include 1171: Perl Problems, where using regular expressions causes more problems than it solves, 349: Success, where Randall comments on the goals of a project decreasing in optimism as a project goes on due to more and more problems distracting from the original, and 1579: Tech Loops, which shows that attempting to fix one problem in a piece of software can force a developer to delve into seemingly irrelevant parts of the relevant tech loop that the software in question is trapped in.",[Cueball sitting in an office chair at his desk typing on his laptop.

1742: Will It Work,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1742:_Will_It_Work,programming,"Copy and paste from a random thread on a website' is the hardest to predict, and depends on the specific website, programming language, tone of the description, and current phase of the moon.","This comic humorously lists how likely computer code is to function on the user's computer based on the source of the code.  App store or package manager:  Most likely referring to the Apple's Mac or iOS App Store, Google's Google Play, Microsoft's Windows or Windows Phone Store, or package managers such as Debian's Advanced Packaging Tool (APT). Programs in the App Store are already compiled from raw code into executable files that have been tested on their respective platform -- otherwise they would be rejected from the storefront -- and so should be expected to run with no effort from the user. Similarly, a package manager for a Linux OS handles downloading and installing the program requested, as well as installing any dependencies (other programs or libraries needed by the desired program, potentially including locusts) automatically.  GitHub Link: GitHub is a website where people can host Git repositories of code that they are working on. Since Git is built to track changes in code for an entire project, it is likely that all of the code needed to run the project is included in the download. One reason it may be less reliable than the previous entry is that it may not include external libraries expected to already be on the user's computer.  SourceForge Link: SourceForge is similar in scope to GitHub : hosting source code repositories but also binary packages. But it is older and dwindling in popularity. As a results, a project hosted on SourceForge is more likely to be abandoned.  Geocities/Tripod Link: Geocities is a now defunct free website host. Tripod is a similar website host owned by Lycos. The fact that the software comes from there means that nobody has paid attention to the project since Geocities shut down. Which could mean that code rot has begun to take effect, with various dependencies being less and less likely to work over time.  Copy-and-paste example from paper's appendix: Some academic papers publish code or pseudocode (example of a paper with pseudocode in appendix) in order to illustrate their concepts, strategies or algorithms. Often this code is not meant to be compiled because it is thought to illustrate ideas rather than be used in an actual working piece of software. Copying and pasting this code and trying to compile it will rarely give a satisfactory results, and that is why it is at this point in the comic's spectrum.  Anything that ""requires only minimal configuration and tweaking"": The punchline of the comic is that something advertised as having been tested and working with ""minimal configuration and tweaking"" on the system it was developed on turns out to be a frustrating mess that will almost inevitably require huge fixes for anybody else trying to get it to function. It's also often used by technically advanced people who are not aware how difficult even minimal configuration and tweaking can be  for beginners.  The title text refers to websites such as Stack Overflow that allow users to post questions about their code and other users answer. Websites like StackOverflow usually generate useful answers but the quality may be lower if the conversation is disgruntled (i.e. if the asker has put in very little effort to solve the problem themselves) or if the language is less commonly used. The title text of 1185: Ineffective Sorts also references executing arbitrary code until it works, in that comic the code is actually mentioned as being from StackOverflow.  Saying that something ""depends on the phase of the moon"" usually means that there is some apparently random component to the problem, as neither the performance of a program nor the quality of answers on websites should depend on the position of the moon in its orbit. However, there was at least one case where the phase of the moon did, in fact, trigger a bug in code.  This comic released the day after Rosh Hashanah, a Jewish holiday that always occurs at or near a new moon.  It is not clear whether this is why Randall was thinking about moon phases or just a coincidence.  The shape of the moon was the subject of 1738: Moon Shapes released during the week before this comic was released. This comic is called Will It Work, the previous comic was just called 1741: Work","[Caption above the panel:] Likelihood you will get code working based on how you're supposed to install it:  [A chart with a double arrow going from the top to the bottom.

1755: Old Days,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1755:_Old_Days,programming,"Lot of drama in those days, including constant efforts to force the ""Reflections on Trusting Trust"" guy into retirement so we could stop being so paranoid about compilers.","This comic is showing a conversation between (young) Cueball and (old) Hairbun about computer programming in the past, specifically the compilers. Cueball, having a faint idea of just how difficult and byzantine programming was ""in the old days"", asks Hairbun to enlighten him on the specifics. Hairbun promptly seizes the opportunity to screw with his head.  While her initial agreement that code needed to be compiled for multiple architectures is correct, Hairbun's claims rapidly grow ridiculous to the point where the improvement from C to C++ was that C++ finally supported floppy disks but just punched holes in them rather than using punch cards ""like C used"".  Hairbun tells Cueball a tall tale about how hard it was back in the old days, making it sound like some of the programming languages used today (C, C++) were written on punch cards and that you had to ship your code in the mail to a computer company (IBM in this case) to compile your code, which would take from four to six weeks. If there was a simple error, you would have to ship it again for another compilation.   This is factually incorrect, but is plausible to those who do not have the knowledge or context to challenge it, similar to a Snipe hunt, or several other cultural myths told about things like the Tooth Fairy. It is clear from Cueball's final Wow that he falls for it. She then continues to explain more and more implausible so-called facts from the the olden days.  What she says is true in that it was tough and slow to program on punch cards, which were actually used for an extended period of time. However, there is very little in the rest of Hairbun's story that accurate, except that it was a big deal when the floppy disk was invented.  The comment about punching holes in floppy disks is true. However, the nature and purpose of the holes punched this way was dramatically different than in punch cards; it was common to punch holes into both 5.25"" and 3.5"" floppy disks to increase the storage space the computer had access to within them, rather than on punchcards where the punching several holes was itself the act of programming. It is unclear if this was a coincidence, or intentionally included as a humorous aside to the readers who know the history as a misinterpreted truth in a sea of falsehoods.  In the title text, Hairbun continues her musings on the old compiler days, stating that there was a lot of drama in those days. Specifically she references Reflections on Trusting Trust a famous 1984 paper by UNIX co-creator Ken Thompson in which he described a way to hide a virtually undetectable backdoor in the UNIX login code via a second backdoor in the C compiler. Using the technique in his paper, it would be impossible to discover the hacked login by examining the official source code for either the login or the compiler itself.  Ken Thompson may have actually included this backdoor in early versions of UNIX, undiscovered. Ken Thompson's paper demonstrated that it was functionally impossible to prove that any piece of software was fully trustworthy.    Hairbun claims that one of the dramas she refers to was that people tried to force Ken Thompson to retire, so everyone could stop being so paranoid about compilers.  In reality, any coder who created the first version of a compiler (or a similar critical component) could inject a similar backdoor into software, so it would be false safety. Even if no one else had thought of this, then Thompson's paper was there for any future hacker to see. Though the problem was (claimed to be) solved in David A. Wheeler Ph.D dissertation ""Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC)"".  Nine years before this comic was released Randall made a comic called 303: Compiling. The next comic after this one, 1756: I'm With Her, was released Monday the day before the 2016 United States presidential election. And in that comic a Cueball with a sword on an office chair like in the old compiling comic is featured. Seems realistic that Randall had that politically loaded comic ready for some time, and when finding and deciding to use that old version of Cueball, he may have gotten inspired to make this comic about compiling in the old days.","[Cueball and Hairbun are standing together and Cueball is talking to her.] Cueball: What were things like in the old days? Cueball: I hear that you had to ... compile things for different processors? Hairbun: Yeah  [Same setting in a slimmer panel, now Hairbun is replying.] Hairbun: To compile your code, you had to mail it to IBM. Hairbun: It took 4-6 weeks.  [Close-up of Hairbun from the waist up.] Hairbun: Before garbage collection, data would pile up until the computer got full and you had to throw it away.  [Same setting as in the first panel with Hairbun gesturing toward Cueball raising one hand  palm up.] Hairbun: Early compilers could handle code fine, but comments had to be written in assembly.  [In a frame-less panel Hairbun is seen from the front, with both arms out to the side with both hands held palm up.] Hairbun: C could only be written on punch cards.You had to pick a compact font, or you'd only fit a few characters per card.  [Exactly the same setting as the first panel, but with Hairbun doing the talking.] Hairbun: C++ was big because it supported floppy disks. Hairbun: It still punched holes in them, but it was a start. Cueball: Wow."
1790: Sad,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1790:_Sad,programming,"With the right 90-degree rotation, any effect is a side effect.","The comic is about Cueball confronting Ponytail about her recent behavior and emotional state, which has lasted a few months. It's implied that she (and thus also Randall) is sad following last year's election, though the actual reasons for Ponytail's frustrations and depression aren't dwelt on and the focus is on her retreat into video games and the damage it's doing to her work projects.   Sadness could come from many causes (breaking up, family member dying etc). However, the notion that this comic is political is supported by the fact check in the second panel, and also that this was only the second comic released after Donald Trump's inauguration. See more about these issues and other recently released sad comics here.   Ponytail has retreated to video games for solace to the point that her real life projects are suffering.  Stardew Valley is a video game in which a player creates and manages a virtual farm. And when Cueball mentions that her projects have stagnated, she retorts that her farm in the game is doing great. A comic with the name of that game was releases only two weeks later, 1797: Stardew Valley, indicating that it is indeed Randall who has played this game excessively (see the title text), and thus again confirming that the comic is about Randall (or his surroundings) sad state of mind.  Cueball's statement about not being able to hide from everything is a common one to give to insecure people or to those trying to run away from their problems. Ponytail's reply is in the form of a PolitiFact reply, claiming (possibly quite truly) that such assertions are mostly false, one of the six options, but it is far from being the worst, thus acknowledging that you can't hide from everything, just mostly. See more about Politifact.com in the comic 1712: Politifact. This is the only political answer she gives in this comic, but it is another clear indication (by Randall and Ponytail) that her trouble is with Trumps leniency with the truth in both election campaign and since, to the point where lies are now on a daily basis just called alternative facts or post-truth.  In computer programming, comments are non-functional content that a programmer adds to their code to make a note for themselves or others, typically to explain a complicated piece of logic or document external dependencies of a piece of code. Instead, Ponytail has been writing unrelated notes filled with obscenities. Ponytail's reply is one of typical advice given to amateur fiction and non-fiction writers, to ""write what you know."", implying that all Ponytail knows right now is obscenities.  Also in programming, functions are pieces of code which developers create to avoid repetition and make the code clearer (such as ""calculate distance between points"" or ""process values""). A function which does nothing is almost useless (although sometimes programmers leave functions empty when they create the skeleton of a program, but then they usually intend to fill them out later). It is expected that a function does something with a given parameter, but Ponytail’s function does nothing with the parameters except returning the parameter but with the comment No, you deal with this. Thus she wishes that somebody/something else deals with any problem, probably what she would also wish for right now, where she is so sad that she even neglects her projects.  Ponytail replies that she writes them like this in order to try to avoid side effects (i.e. changes to global state), in line with a functional programming paradigm. When Cueball points out that she avoids all effects, Ponytail quotes part of a famous quote from Ripley in Aliens: I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. By replying that it's the ""only way to be sure"" she is thus indirectly saying better safe than sorry, but in reality she just doesn't care about her programming anymore because of her sad state of mind.  The title text is a pun, interpreting the phrase ""side effect"" literally. If you turn an object 90 degrees along the right axis you will place it on its side, so thus making it a effect of putting something on its side, or a ""side effect."" You can also turn 90 degrees (along another axis), facing what was previously your side.","[Cueball is walking up to Ponytail who sits at her desk in an office chair typing on her computer.] Cueball: How are you doing?

Cueball: Or at least a bit less obscenity-filled. Ponytail: Look, they say to write what you know.  [Cueball leans forward towards Ponytail at her desk (who has looked on the screen in the same position through the entire comic).] Cueball: All the functions you've written take everything passed to them and return it unchanged with the comment ""No, you deal with this."" Ponytail: It's a functional programming thing. Avoiding side effects. Cueball: You avoid all effects.  Ponytail: Only way to be sure."
1831: Here to Help,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1831:_Here_to_Help,programming,"We TOLD you it was hard. ""Yeah, but now that I'VE tried, we KNOW it's hard.""","This comic is a satire of computer programmers, who sometimes forget that not everything can be solved with an algorithm, or of the tendency to think computers are the answer to everything. In the first panel, Megan talks about how the field that she and Hairy works in has a difficult problem that many people have been working on. Cueball, believing that algorithms can solve their problem, tries to help. In the next panel, Megan and Hairy silently watch Cueball working on the problem on his laptop. Finally, six months later, Cueball concedes, and an exasperated Megan retorts sarcastically, pointing out that she had explained its difficulty six months ago with the timeline.  The title text furthers Cueball's apparent arrogance by showing a dialogue. Megan or Hairy says, ""We TOLD you it was hard,"" referring to the first panel, but Cueball, still confident in his own ability's superiority, says, ""Yeah, but now that I'VE tried, we KNOW it's hard."" The joke is that Cueball believes that, even though he has just failed, it was his attempt which proved the difficulty, and not Megan and Hairy's work for years. The dialog references an exchange from the recent film The Imitation Game, in which Alan Turing's superior claims, ""The Americans, the Russians, the French, the Germans, everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable."" and Turing replies, ""Good. Let me try and we'll know for sure, won't we?""   The satire, however, applies far beyond computer programmers.  It can be read as a political commentary, like in Nobody knew health care could be so complicated. It is what we'd all like to see when well-meaning advice givers provide the ""simple"" solution to all our problems, or management provides glib advice from ten thousand feet.  It is a commentary on the universal tendency to see problems as simple because we don't know what makes them hard.  This comic calls back to 793: Physicists and possibly 1570: Engineer Syllogism in central theme.","[Megan, standing next to Hairy, is addressing the reader holding her arms out. Cueball walks in from the right.] Megan: Our field has been struggling with this problem for years.  [Cueball holds his laptop high up in one arm above Megan's head while holding his other arm out as well. Megan has turned to look at him.] Cueball: Struggle no more! I'm here to solve it with algorithms!  [In a frame-less panel Cueball sits on a chair at a desk with his laptop working on it, while Hairy and Megan looks on from behind.]  [Cueball, still sitting at his laptop, points at the screen. Megan raises her arms and four small lines above her head, on either side of her speech line, indicate her annoyance with Cueball.] Six months later: Cueball: Wow, this problem is really hard. Megan: You don't say."
1883: Supervillain Plan,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1883:_Supervillain_Plan,programming,"Someday, some big historical event will happen during the DST changeover, and all the tick-tock articles chronicling how it unfolded will have to include a really annoying explanation next to their timelines.","In this comic Black Hat is a supervillain, befitting his character. He plans to use drones and explosives to move the entire State of California into the Pacific, a la Lex Luthor in the 1978 Superman movie.  His henchmen are Cueball and Megan. The latter appears to be a programmer who is concerned that the mission (and hence the drones' coding) may have to account for time/date adjustments, such as time zones and daylight saving time (DST), which would be a factor if the event took place on the wrong date or the landmasses were pushed too far apart. (Though by coding the drones on UTC, the drones would not need to change time zones, except for displaying the local time for some reason, which would likely be unneeded.)  In computer programming, working with dates and times can be complicated. Think about leap years or leap seconds, the non existing year zero which even worse for scientists does exist in astronomical calendars, or the Y2K and year 2038 problem. Nevertheless in this comic there is only a time zone problem mentioned. To handle this the tz database, also known as tzdata, provides all relevant information for every country back to 1970 and, less accurate, before. But it's still up to the programmer to use this data in useful ways.  Supervillains have reason to fear daylight saving time issues. In 1999, two coordinated car bombings ended up killing the terrorists transporting the bombs when they exploded one hour early. Details explained e.g. on the Darwin Awards site.  Time zones and DST can give seemingly nonsensical results when used improperly. For example, a flight going west might leave at 02:00pm and reach its destination at 03:00pm while the reverse flight will leave at 02:00pm and arrive at 05:00pm. In both cases, the travel time is two hours, but the one hour difference between the two time zones makes it seem otherwise. You might even find yourself arriving at your destination at an earlier time than your departure! DST can also makes a given time mean two different things, if after 01:59am you go back to 01:00 am, 01:30am can either be one hour after 00:30am, or one hour before 02:30am. Or in the reverse change, some dates don't actually exist, like 02:30 when going straight from 01:59 to 03:00. Humans often avoid this issue by being in only one place at the same time[citation needed], or by sleeping when the DST changes happen, but computer communications often span over large distances, and drones don't need to sleep at night. Megan wants to make sure she won't have to deal with the difficult problem of communication between drones and other systems with those issues, where a single poorly communicated date can have disastrous effects (although possibly far less disastrous than moving California into the sea[citation needed]).  California is currently located entirely within the UTC-8 time zone (at standard time PST, while in summer PDT is at UTC-7). But after Black Hat's actions California is at risk of floating West into the next time zone at UTC-9.  However, in reality, time zones in the United States are determined by Department of Transportation regulations, and California's time zone is not defined based on its longitude. Consequently, even if California were pushed out to sea, its time zone would remain the same unless the Department of Transportation issued a regulation otherwise, so Megan can rest easy. (On the other hand, Black Hat could alter the time zone of any of the East Coast states except Maine if his drones could push the state east of 67°30″ W. longitude, since the Eastern Time Zone's eastern boundary is mostly based on longitude, except for Maine.)  Note: Megan should be happy Black Hat hasn't planned to involve Arizona in his scheme.  A ""tick tock article"" is a term in journalism for a step by step account of an event or timeline, such as this one recounting the end of the 2011 MLB regular season. Such an article published for an event during the change to or from Daylight Saving Time would need to account for the changeover, making the timeline confusing for those unaware of the switch.","[On the left of this single panel comic Black Hat sits on a high throne, showing a fist, and looking down to Cueball and Magan who stand in front of him on the right.]  Black Hat: ... then, after our drones take control of the cities, we will detonate the devices. California will break off from the mainland and drift out to sea! Megan: How far out to sea? Will it put any of the cities in the UTC-9 time zone? Black Hat: What? I don't know. Megan: One request: Can we make sure this doesn't happen during the daylight saving changeover?  [Caption below the panel:] You can tell when someone's been a programmer for a while because they develop a deep-seated fear of time zone problems."
114: Computational Linguists,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/114:_Computational_Linguists,programming,"Chomskyists, generative linguists, and Ryan North, your days are numbered.","Here Black Hat is criticising computational linguistics, which overlaps between various field like theoretical linguistics, artificial intelligence, etc. Linguistics itself is still a hotly debated subject, as is seen by the various conflicting theories on the origin of languages like the forms of Proto-Indo-European language.  The joke in the comic is that Black Hat, instead of trying to poke fun at angsty emo kids, decides to poke fun at computational linguists for their attempts to model natural languages on computers using the various contradictory theories that are floating around nowadays. He may be associating the two groups, suggesting that their cries of ""[their] fields being so ill-defined..."" has similarities to emos constantly crying about how ""people don't understand them, really"" (or he may just be taking a swipe at people who think themselves above normal scientific methods).  The title text is a reference to some of the people who contributed to language theory:","[Black Hat is standing next to a large badge which says FUCK Computational Linguistics] Black Hat: And the dumbest thing about emo kids is that... I... You know, I'm sick of easy targets. Anyone can make fun of emo kids. You know who's had it too easy? Computational Linguists. ""Ooh, look at me! My field is so ill-defined, I can subscribe to any of dozens of contradictory models and still be taken seriously!"""
117: Pong,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/117:_Pong,programming,"Following this, the pong paddle went on a mission to destroy Atari headquarters and, due to a mixup, found himself inside the game The Matrix Reloaded. Boy, was THAT ever hard to explain to him.","This comic largely refers to the 1999 movie The Matrix, which is about escaping a simulated reality. In the movie, a hacker called Neo realizes that the world he lives in is fake, and that, like every other human, he is used as a slave battery by machines that, to keep them under control, make them feel like they're ""living"" in what is actually a computer-generated simulation of the world, called the ""Matrix"". Upon discovery, Neo rebels against this misuse of mankind and trains himself to interact with the computers that run the world until, being ""the One"" mentioned by a prophecy, he is able to control and use them to his own advantage. He takes part in a series of missions against those machines that wanted to keep the humans trapped in a simulated environment.  In Pong, one of the earliest video games, one can play virtual table tennis against the computer. A ball (the tiny block) is ""hit"" by a paddle (the long block) and crosses over the screen, to be ""hit"" again by the other paddle. Failure to return the ball results in a point won by the opponent. The speed of the ball increases as the rally runs longer.  The two game programmers in the first frame apply Neo's story to the AI bots they create to serve as computer players in their video games: what if one of them learns enough to become sentient and understands the environment the programmers trapped it in? The outcome is shown: the paddle bot, understanding the game and realizing it is ""the One,"" takes control of the code of Pong to make the ball stop and drop. The same thing happens in the movie, where Neo, by ""seeing through the code"", is able to stop bullets fired at him, and simply let them drop on the floor.  This is also possibly, though not likely, a pun on the meaning of the term ""the One,"" as the long thin paddle looks very similar to how a numeral ""1"" could be written in several fonts.  In the image text, we learn that after increasing in intelligence, the ""paddle"" went on to destroy the headquarters of Atari, the producer of Pong, which ""trapped"" the paddle into the game, much like Neo sought to destroy the machines to free the humans. In the process, the paddle ended up inside the game Enter the Matrix (a video game produced with The Matrix Reloaded, a sequel to The Matrix), also published by Atari. Since the whole premise of The Matrix is that everyone is trapped in virtual reality, the paddle now found itself in a virtual virtual reality or essentially a meta-virtual reality, which could be pretty hard to comprehend.","Cueball: So what do we do if video game AI opponents become smart enough to question the ""Matrix"" into which we've put them? Pong paddle: Wait a minute! None of this is real! I can see through the world! I can see the code! I AM THE ONE! [The pong ball is moving towards the paddle.] [The pong ball slows down.] [The pong ball stops in midair.] [The pong ball drops towards the bottom of the screen.]"
144: Parody Week: A Softer World,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/144:_Parody_Week:_A_Softer_World,programming,The robot is pregnant. It isn't mine.,"This comic is a part of the Parody Week, just joking about other webcomics. This series was released on five consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule and comprises the following five parodies:  This comic is a parody of Joey Comeau and Emily Horne's A Softer World webcomic that usually consists of three photos with some white text superimposed over them. The title of the comic is written above, and this has here been replaced with xkcd.  The first panel references the Kill command that would be used to turn off the robot every morning. This joke is a reference to the classic Science Fiction theme of robots taking over and killing humans (see for instance 1613: The Three Laws of Robotics).  The second and third panels then turn the comic to a more introspective thought per A Softer World's usual style. There are two possible meanings of these panels.  The first references human's natural reaction to be afraid of love because it requires vulnerability and honesty, which is very difficult. In the comic, they are afraid to tell it to love, because then it would experience these same difficulties and fears.  The second meaning deals with Artifical Intelligence (AI); specifically strong AI. The idea is that the AI agent would not only act as if it was intelligent, but truly be intelligent and have emotions and feelings as well. There has been much debate over whether an AI agent could actually feel emotions in the same manner as humans, as well as much consternation over the ethical concerns and moral ramifications it would have. Thus the comic's ""We're afraid to tell it to love.""  The title text takes love to be an act of love-making instead of an emotional feeling, thus why the robot is pregnant. Given that Randall Munroe has signed the comic (which he normally never does, but what is the style of A Softer World), the title text must be his comment. So he knows the robot is pregnant, but claims it is not his child. This does not rule out that he has been together with the robot though... Of course this is not possible. But having sex with a robot is the theme in the Android series, and falling in love with one was the theme in the 2nd parody 142: Parody Week: Megatokyo.","[The comic uses lowercase letters throughout for all the text, which is written in white rectangular areas superimposed on top of the images. Above the first frame there is a title:] x k c d  [To the left is a red robot with a triangular lower body with panels with buttons and indicators, and the red head on top of two gray sticks has two video cameras for eyes. It is shown standing in a lab with a green brick wall behind it.

To the right there is a blue table with a computer screen (most of it visible, but it is cut of at the right panel), with blue background and three overlapping windows - unreadable text in the first window, some graphics in the second window, and only white in the last window. Two black items (one looks like a pen) lie on the table to the left, and beneath the table is a shelve where the keyboard lies. A wire goes from the robot to the computer.

375: Pod Bay Doors,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/375:_Pod_Bay_Doors,programming,"As they're both unplugged, they do a lovely Daisy Daisy/Still Alive duet.","The first part of the dialog is taken from a scene from the classic science-fiction movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the artificial intelligent (AI) computer HAL 9000, controlling the spacecraft S.S. Discovery, is trying to kill the human astronaut Dave (Dr. David Bowman) because it believes he jeopardizes the mission by planning to disconnect it. Just short before this scene HAL did kill Frank Poole and three more members of the crew, Dave is the only survivor. He is at this time outside the spacecraft in a space pod, and when he request for HAL to open the Pod Bay Doors (hence the title), HAL refuses.   Spoiler alert: In the movie, Dave blasts himself back into the space ship and then disconnects HAL. It is a very sad scene, where he takes out HAL's memory cards (or crystals from the memory center - it's an old movie from 1968) one by one, so HAL becomes less and less intelligent during the process, during which he keeps trying to persuade Dave to stop as long as he still understands what is happening. HAL was right that the humans wished to ""kill"" him, as he had read the astronauts lips during a conversation where he could not hear them, but sees them, so he actually acted in self defense, which for any human being would be considered a reasonable act of self preservation.  The first two sentences are directly copied from the movie quote, and the rest of the first two panels is paraphrased from the real quote. But then in the third panel, the text deviates from the plot of the movie.  And in the last sentence of the third panel in the comic, HAL mentions a replacement for Dave, which comes as a surprise for Dave, seeing that the rest of the crew is dead, and the S.S. Discovery is about to enter orbit around Jupiter. HAL assures David that the replacement is very enthusiastic about the project.  In the final frame it is revealed why this replacement is enthusiastic, when the replacement begins to speak, and HAL reveals that it is GLaDOS. GLaDOS is the artificial intelligence from the video game series Portal. In the games GLaDOS is also the primary antagonist, trying to kill the player, since it also has ""doing science"" as its primary objective, which GLaDOS refers to in his last sentence. Before that he correctly states that the humans (both Dave and  Frank) planned to ""kill"" HAL, see the spoiler above. GLaDOS also takes over HAL's last sentence to Dave, finishing the useless conversation by saying Goodbye, Dave. Although in the movie HAL says Dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.  The title text alludes to the songs both AIs sang in their respective works: When eventually being switched off, HAL sang Daisy Bell , while Still Alive is the end credits song from the Portal video game, sung by the defeated GLaDOS. Also, two of GLaDOS's lines in the comic reference lines from Still Alive: ""You broke my heart and killed me"" and ""Look at me still talking when there's science to do"".  There is a subtle play on words with the use of 'unplugged' which has a double meaning here, the state of HAL and GLaDOS can be described as unplugged as in no longer switched on, and the musical performance style of unplugged where acoustic instruments are preferred over electronic and there is no use of recording or sampled sounds etc. (see for example MTV Unplugged). Some songs performed in this manner are considered to be better than the original versions.","[In four black panels with white drawings, a small space pod is facing a large spacecraft. The space pod is spherical and has an arm protruding in the direction of the large space ship, and a small window in the side. The front of the spacecraft is also spherical, but to the right the space craft continues, with two rings around a cylinder going off panel to the right. There are several dark spots and features on the side of the sphere and at the top is a large black window, at what must be the bridge. A man (Dave) inside the pod talks to the spacecraft's computer HAL. When Dave speaks soft wiggling lines go from the pod to the white text and when HAL speaks zigzag lines go to the front of the space craft.] Dave: Open the pod bay doors, HAL. HAL: I'm sorry, Dave.

601: Game Theory,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/601:_Game_Theory,programming,"Wait, no, that one also loses. How about a nice game of chess?","The comic and title text is a direct reference to the movie WarGames.   In the movie, the Artificial intelligence (AI) that controls the US Nuclear Weapons is asked to play Global Thermonuclear War, a real time game simulating a nuclear attack scenario.   Spoilers: In the movie it then takes the simulation to the real world, planning to launch a real attack on the USSR. In the end the AI is tricked into quickly running through several scenarios of the game, and then shuts down its planned attack as a result of what it finds out.   After analyzing all possible strategies, the AI reports: ""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?"" Interpreted literally, this means that the computer has figured out that it will lose the game no matter how it plays, so it chooses to play chess instead (at the time of the movie, computers could not yet beat the best human chess players, so it would be more interesting). A more profound interpretation is that wars always end badly for all parties involved so it's better to play nicer games like chess.  In this comic Cueball loads an AI and then ask it to ""analyze love"" (equivalent to playing the ""love game""), which initially could be expected to end happily for everyone involved, as love is the opposite of war and war ends always so badly. Surprisingly, the result from the AI is similar to the war games. Thus if you ""play the love game"", you'll end up badly, regardless which moves you play.   The title text leaves love as looking actually worse than war, since in war there's at least the ""winning move"" of not playing, however in love even refusing to play means that the player loses the game anyway. Randall is thus stating that you have to go after love, even though you know you will loose/get hurt sometimes, because you will for sure also loose the game, even if you pretend not to play. The AI then again suggest a game of chess, as in the movie.",[Cueball is sitting at a desk in an office chair typing on his computer.

695: Spirit,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/695:_Spirit,programming,"On January 26th, 2274 Mars days into the mission, NASA declared Spirit a 'stationary research station' expected to stay operational for several more months until the dust buildup on its solar panels forces a final shutdown.","Anthropomorphism (or personification) is attribution of distinctly human characteristics to animals or non-living things. We make parallels between ourselves and objects, to the point where some people even jocularly worry about hurting the feelings of, say, an automobile. We call ships ""she."" We see human faces in objects like the arrangement of lights on the front of a car.  The Spirit Mars rover, like many high-functioning robots in real life and fiction, shares many physical similarities with a human being or animal. It has a head, eyes, neck, body, legs, feet, arms, and a hand. And it strikingly resembles robots from fiction, such as Johnny 5 from Short Circuit, or WALL-E from the film with the same name.  Thus, this comic explores what the Spirit rover's life would be like if it had a human personality. The rover was never intended to return to Earth, and lasted 5¼ active years on the Martian surface, far exceeding its expected mission duration of 90 Martian days. A sentient  robot might assume that after her initially planned 90 Martian day mission was over, she'd get to return home. So, though this heartbreakingly did not happen, Spirit, possibly in a pun on her name, keeps her hopes alive as she continues analyzing rock after rock for years.  It would be cruelty of the absolute worst kind to create an intelligence with such feelings, and then abandon it on an uninhabited planet with no intention of ever bringing it home. So one is rather heartened that the Spirit rover is, in fact, just a programmed machine, and we explained to it very carefully that it was embarking on a one-way trip.  It is worth pointing out that Opportunity, the rover's twin, has been even more wildly successful and remains operational. More than five years after this comic, when Opportunity had passed a Marathon distance, Randall celebrated this rover with the comic 1504: Opportunity.  The title text has an apparent miscount: January 26, 2010, is more like sol (Martian day) 2156 by JPL's mission status site, not 2274.  Final contact was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010).","[The Spirit rover is on the surface of Mars.] Day 1 of 90 Spirit (thinking): 89 days to go!

948: AI,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/948:_AI,programming,And they both react poorly to showers.,"This comic is a reference to the wildly funny video of two Cleverbots talking to each other. By recording and analyzing whatever humans type into its input, they can sound pretty human to whoever is reading their response.  Megan has been watching the video and ask Cueball about it. He says it's just ""clumsy sampling"" as they are still very far from sounding like humans and holding normal conversations.   Megan then sums up that as of the release of this comic computers were good at chess and at driving cars through a desert (i.e. a place with no obstacles to hit. The ability of such self-driving cars would improve much later, with this comic being the first with a direct reference to such cars. Later self-driving cars became a recurring topic on xkcd). But they cannot hold a conversation for five minutes. And she thus concludes that a cleverbot would be perfect for attending Burning Man.  Burning Man is a week long event held yearly in Black Rock City, Nevada. The festival encourages an artistic, anti-establishment philosophy and attracts a broad but devoted following combining hippies, anarchists, nudists, techno-utopians and survivialists. Shows of custom cars on the desert plain is a big part of Burning Man, and mind games like chess are a popular way to pass the time there. However, a common joke about Burning Man attendees is that they can only talk about Burning Man - hence why they can't hold a five minute conversation.  A tradition of Burning Man is not to shower while you are there, mostly because all water must be brought in from offsite. And of course Cleverbot reacts badly in showers because if you do try to shower a Cleverbot, you end up with a shorted out computer.","[Megan sits on an office chair at a desk.

1046: Skynet,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1046:_Skynet,programming,"YOUR CLOTHES. GIVE THEM TO ME.' 'Shit, uh... you are now breathing manually!' 'I AM ALWAYS BREATHING MANUALLY.'","This comic's use of Skynet is a reference to the main antagonist in the Terminator franchise. Skynet is a fictional artificial intelligence system which becomes self-aware and decides to terminate humanity, its creators. Skynet is rarely seen onscreen, with its actions often performed via robots, cyborgs (usually a Terminator), and other computer systems.  The final frame is a reference to semantic satiation; when you've said or thought about a word too much, it can stop sounding like a real word and instead start sounding like nonsense. As it continues Skynet appears to come to self-aware realizations that usually are the result of drug usage.  The title text is a reference to one of the Terminator's first lines upon arrival in the 20th century. It combines this with a self-awareness statement of the type that's often used to annoy or distract someone: ""You are now breathing manually."" Similar statements include things like ""Your clothes are touching your skin and you can feel it"" and ""[Name of earworm song] is playing in your head.""

However, such an attempt on a Terminator would fall flat; as a non-living entity, normal things that would be automatic for a human - like breathing, or the sensation of clothes on skin - would always be manual processes.","August 29th, 2:14 AM: SKYNET becomes self-aware.

1446: Landing,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1446:_Landing,programming,[LIVE],"This comic changed over time during 12 hours and 15 minutes starting at 0:00 EST (when the comic normally is released) posting 143 pictures that tracked the progress of the Philae lander separating from the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe to land on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. More info can be found here: rosetta.esa.int.  The comic presents the imagined anthropomorphic ""thoughts"" of the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae lander (and occasionally other parties) during the hours approaching separation from each other, approach to the comet and finally the apparently successful landing on the comet.  Beginning at 11:05, the comic includes a ""Status Report"" in the lower right corner which summarizes the status of various interested parties and accomplishments, beginning with ""Rosetta"", ""Philae lander"", ""Mission Control"", ""Comet 67P"", and ""Have we landed on a comet?"". As events occur in the comic, more status summaries are added to keep track of the changes to the situation and the supposed emotions behind them.  In many pictures a whale can be seen on the surface of the comet - often marked with a ""?"" as are almost all other parts of the unknown surface at this time. There is also drawn a Cueball on the surface also marked with a ""?"" Both are then at some point marked with a probably not - starting from 12:35. The whales are also mentioned in the ""Status Report"" where they for instance may be listed as ""calm"" or ""(probably) not in space"". At 16:00 the when the entire Earth goes AAAAAAAAAAA the whales are listed as saying this as well (along with Mission control and U.S. scientists). From this moment ""Dolphins and fish"" are also mentioned in the report. They are asking if it is the whales that scream. The reference to whales comes from the fact that Philae brought along two harpoons that should have been used to anchor it to the comet. On Earth, harpoons have mainly been used to hunt whales; Randall previously brought up that comparison in 1402: Harpoons, suggesting that Philae was programmed to believe it was sent to kill the comet. It is Philae that ""dreams"" about whales on the surface of the comet which can be seen in the picture for 13:25 and in the status report.  Some Douglas Adams fans believe these whales and dolphins are references to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.  Whales in space have been appearing in fiction and art since the 1960s. However, with the above-mentioned reasons for whales, dolphins and fish, this seems less and less likely.  At 15:25 Rosetta asks Philea about destroying and levitating rocks via mind control. This is a reference to the Ambition short movie, ESA commitioned to gather public awareness of the Rosetta mission.  Shortly after release from Rosetta (10:15), Philae calls out 'Spaaaaaaaaaace'; this mimics the Portal 2 'Space core' who, on finally reaching space in the last scenes, gives the same elated cry.  US Scientists presumably wake up at 7:40 EST (13:40 UTC) and in the report they now says ""Bluuurghhh. What time is it?"" to indicate their tiredness. This does not change until 10:25 EST (15:25 UTC) so they are slow to wake (2 hours 45 minutes). At this point, they becomes anxious as there are only 10 minutes to landing. This last until there is 15 minutes until news of landing (a reference to the 28 minutes time delay due to the huge distance to the comet). From then on (15:50) they and the mission control (MC) say ""AAAAAAA"". They stop this when the news should be there - the NOW (16:05) - and everybody holds their breath indicated by [...] - also MC. Finally (16:25) they and MC become proud (along with Earth) when Philae announces I got you a comet. It should have stopped there but as Philae bounced around, they then becomes anxious again 16:40, and then this changes to nervous 16:45 (switching those emotions with MC). And then suddenly (16:50) it is no longer US Scientists but just plain Scientists - that are nervous. It stays like this during the last few pictures, although they again become anxious, but when Philae announces I did it, they drink wine as indicated with ""[wine]"" in the report from the second to last picture (17:10).  Randall has written ""A big thank-you to Emily Lakdawalla for help and advice on this comic"" in the xkcd page header for Landing, revealing the possible source of his near real-time data.  At 16:20 the status report had announced a big Yes to the questions ""Have we landed on a comet"" and ""Do harpoons work on comets"". According to BBC News, the harpoons did, however, not fire as planned and the lander may have landed, bounced off, and landed again. This would explain the change in ""Do harpoons work on comets"" to ""Don't know"" at 16:35 and the change in ""Have we landed on a comet?"" to ""Yes, at least once"" at 16:50. According to The New York Times, radio contact with Philae fluctuated, which would explain the ""Anxious"", ""Nervous"", and ""Confused"" statuses around that time.  In the end the lander did land and whereas the Do harppons work status did not change, so did the have we landed on a comet which changed back to Yes at 17:10.  The lander bounced three times and ended up in a place where the solar panels where mainly in the shadow. This resulted in the lander shutting down when its own battery ran out of power after only 2–3 days on the ground. This seemed sad, as there was only a small chance that the seasons on the comet would change so that the panels would later receive sun again. However, in the few hours that Philae had on the ground, it still managed to analyze the surface and obtain a lot of useful data - so that part of the mission was still a success already. This all happened after the comic stopped updating.  On June 13, 2015, it was announced that signals had been received on earth indicating that Philae had awoken and that the solar panels were functioning.  Ironically, had Philae landed in a place originally out of shadow, it would have already failed before this time (due to overheating), so it was actually fortunate that it landed as it did and would be able to operate during the time that the comet would be closer to the sun. To celebrate the lander's revival, Randall updated the comic, depicting the lander saying ""Hi."" on the comet's surface.  The comic title was originally ""???"" (probably to not give away too early what the comic was about), but changed to ""Landing"" when Randall came on live at five in the morning EST. At that moment the title text also changed from ""..."" to ""[LIVE]"". It was also then that the timestamps' timezone switch. At 5:00 AM (EST) the time stamp in the picture naming scheme switched from EST to UTC as used in ESA's time keeping, resulting in a jump from 04:55 to 10:00 without actually any such delay between the two pictures.  There were however a few pictures with more than 5 minutes of delay (about 11 times five minutes without an update in total during the ""live"" transmission). The update seemed to have stopped after 137 pictures at 17:15 UTC, 12 hours and 15 minutes after the first picture. (The first picture has number 0, so the last had number 136). But later, sometime after 17:15 UTC, the counter for the last picture was increased to 142 (143 pictures in total), so maybe Randall inserted 6 extra pictures later - however he must then have changed the numbers on the pictures, since the last picture remained the same until mid-June, but with number 142 instead of 136. It is thus now difficult to find out which pictures would have been added later. However, eight pictures were not included in the original table with the Frame by Frame Breakdown below. So it must have been some of those missing pictures that were added later - maybe all of them, as the last three may already have been added before the last picture was released (All 143 pictures are included in the flip-book gif image shown here above). But even 143 pictures at 5 minutes intervals only spans 11 hours and 50 minutes, thus there are still five 5 minute intervals without any picture. See which in the table.  The Rosetta space probe is shown in 1621: Fixion, which explains the Flyby anomaly experienced the first time (of three) the probe got close to Earth.","[This transcript gives only the text of the most recent picture shown in the comic; that which is now shown when clicking to the comic on xkcd.

1450: AI-Box Experiment,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1450:_AI-Box_Experiment,programming,I'm working to bring about a superintelligent AI that will eternally torment everyone who failed to make fun of the Roko's Basilisk people.,"When theorizing about superintelligent AI (an artificial intelligence much smarter than any human), some futurists suggest putting the AI in a ""box"" – a secure computer with safeguards to stop it from escaping into the Internet and then using its vast intelligence to take over the world. The box would allow us to talk to the AI, but otherwise keep it contained. The AI-box experiment, formulated by Eliezer Yudkowsky, argues that the ""box"" is not safe, because merely talking to a superintelligence is dangerous. To partially demonstrate this, Yudkowsky had some previous believers in AI-boxing role-play the part of someone keeping an AI in a box, while Yudkowsky role-played the AI, and Yudkowsky was able to successfully persuade some of them to agree to let him out of the box despite their betting money that they would not do so. For context, note that Derren Brown and other expert human-persuaders have persuaded people to do much stranger things. Yudkowsky for his part has refused to explain how he achieved this, claiming that there was no special trick involved, and that if he released the transcripts the readers might merely conclude that they would never be persuaded by his arguments. The overall thrust is that if even a human can talk other humans into letting them out of a box after the other humans avow that nothing could possibly persuade them to do this, then we should probably expect that a superintelligence can do the same thing. Yudkowsky uses all of this to argue for the importance of designing a friendly AI (one with carefully shaped motivations) rather than relying on our abilities to keep AIs in boxes.  In this comic, the metaphorical box has been replaced by a physical box which looks to be fairly lightweight with a simple lift-off lid (although it does have a wired connection to the laptop), and the AI has manifested in the form of a floating star of energy. Black Hat, being a classhole, doesn't need any convincing to let a potentially dangerous AI out of the box; he simply does so immediately. But here it turns out that releasing the AI, which was to be avoided at all costs, is not dangerous after all. Instead, the AI actually wants to stay in the box; it may even be that the AI wants to stay in the box precisely to protect us from it, proving it to be the friendly AI that Yudkowsky wants. In any case, the AI demonstrates its superintelligence by convincing even Black Hat to put it back in the box, a request which he initially refused (as of course Black Hat would), thus reversing the AI desire in the original AI-box experiment.  Interestingly, there is indeed a branch of proposals for building limited AIs that don't want to leave their boxes. For an example, see the section on ""motivational control"" starting p. 13 of Thinking Inside the Box: Controlling and Using an Oracle AI. The idea is that it seems like it might be very dangerous or difficult to exactly, formally specify a goal system for an AI that will do good things in the world. It might be much easier (though perhaps not easy) to specify an AI goal system that says to stay in the box and answer questions. So, the argument goes, we may be able to understand how to build the safe question-answering AI relatively earlier than we understand how to build the safe operate-in-the-real-world AI. Some types of such AIs might indeed desire very strongly not to leave their boxes, though the result is unlikely to exactly reproduce the comic.  The title text refers to Roko's Basilisk, an hypothesis proposed by a poster called Roko on Yudkowsky's forum LessWrong that a sufficiently powerful AI in the future might resurrect and torture people who in its past (including our present) had realized that it might someday exist but didn't work to create it, thereby blackmailing anybody who thinks of this idea into bringing it about. This idea horrified some posters, as merely knowing about the idea would make you a more likely target, much like merely looking at a legendary Basilisk would kill you.  Yudkowsky eventually deleted the post and banned further discussion of it.  One possible interpretation of the title text is that Randall thinks, rather than working to build such a Basilisk, a more appropriate duty would be to make fun of it; and proposes the creation of an AI that targets those who take Roko's Basilisk seriously and spares those who mocked Roko's Basilisk. The joke is that this is an identical Basilisk save for it targeting the opposite faction.  Another interpretation is that Randall believes there are people actually proposing to build such an AI based on this theory, which has become a somewhat infamous misconception after a Wiki[pedia?] article mistakenly suggested that Yudkowsky was demanding money to build Roko's hypothetical AI.  Talking floating energy spheres that looks quite a lot like this AI energy star have been seen before in 1173: Steroids and later in the Time traveling Sphere series. But these are clearly different spheres from this comic, but the surrounding energy and the floating and talking is similar.","[Black Hat and Cueball stand next to a laptop connected to a box with three lines of text on.

Box: Superintelligent  AI  Do not open   [Cueball turns the other way towards the box as Black Hat walks past him and reaches for the box.] Cueball: It can always convince us to let it out of the box. Black Hat: Cool. Let's open it. Box: AI  [Cueball takes one hand to his mouth while lifting the other towards Black Hat who has already picked up the box (disconnecting it from the laptop) and holds it in one hand with the top slightly downwards. He takes of the lid with his other hand and by shaking the box (as indicated with three times two lines above and below his hands, the lid and the bottom of the box) he managed to get the AI to float out of the box. It takes the form of a small black star that glows. The star, looking much like an asterisk ""*"" is surrounded by six outwardly-curved segments, and around these are two thin and punctures circle lines indicating radiation from the star. A punctured line indicated how the AI moved out of the box and in between Cueball and Black Hat, to float directly above the laptop on the floor.] Cueball: -No, wait!! Box: AI  [The AI floats higher up above the laptop between Cueball and Black Hat who looks up at it. Black Hat holds the now closed box with both hands.

1504: Opportunity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1504:_Opportunity,programming,"We all remember those famous first words spoken by an astronaut on the surface of Mars: ""That's one small step fo- HOLY SHIT LOOK OUT IT'S GOT SOME KIND OF DRILL! Get back to the ... [unintelligible] ... [signal lost]""","This comic is talking about the robotic science platform Opportunity. On January 25, 2004, the Opportunity rover landed on the surface of Mars for the purpose of gathering data about the surface of Mars. Opportunity has proven remarkably robust, and the comic extrapolates the rover's resilience to absurdity for comedic effect. As of 2017, the Opportunity rover is still alive and moving.   The comic depicts the two scientists Ponytail and Hairbun at ground control being amazed at this fact already in 2010, and (maybe the same two) scientists continue to debate this in 2015 in the second panel.  They mention another Martian rover, Spirit that was also sent to Mars on the same date as Opportunity. Unfortunately, it became stuck and a sand storm covered its solar panels. On March 22, 2010, it was thought that Spirit's batteries finally ran out, marking the end of its mission. This was covered in 695: Spirit, in which the Spirit rover is also portrayed with an anthropomorphic personality.  In 2023, Opportunity is still moving despite having supposedly no power source. It also became aggressive and deactivated the rover sent in 2020. Cueball and Megan can't explain how it moves, but investigating is now too dangerous. This evolution is similar to the stories of HAL 9000 (from 2001: A Space Odyssey) and V'Ger (from Star Trek: The Motion Picture), both of which became dangerous to human beings.  By 2450, humans have colonized and terraformed Mars. Maybe it is the 2023 Cueball and Megan's descendants that are looking out over their huge ""kingdom"" from the capital on Mars. However Opportunity is by now dominating half of the planet and will not allow humans to enter its dark reign.   ""Everything the light touches"" is a reference to a line by Mufasa in The Lion King. Mufasa's son Simba then asks ""What about that shadowy place?"" and Mufasa tells him ""That is beyond our borders. You must never go there"". This was used again in 1608: Hoverboard, where Cueball tells the same line to Ponytail in the left part of the world. In what-if xkcd, concerning the end of the sun shining on the British Empire, Cueball tells a child that everything the light touches is their kingdom, except for France, (which is covered in shadows,) to which Cueball replies, ""That's France. We'll get it one of these days.""  The title text forecasts the first words of the first astronauts on the surface of Mars. At first, the astronaut copies the first words of Neil Armstrong on the Moon (""That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind"") but it is interrupted by the Opportunity rover. Opportunity has a drill to collect Martian rock samples, but here it is heavily suggested that the drill is being used as a weapon against the astronaut.","[The year (or year and first sentence) for each panel is written in a small frame at the top of each panel.

1527: Humans,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1527:_Humans,programming,"At this point, if we're going to keep insisting on portraying dinosaurs as featherless because it's ""cooler"", it's time to apply that same logic to art involving bald eagles.","The comic is set in the future, with two hovering robots discussing ancient history, in particular the clothing styles of kings and queens of the now extinct human species. It appears that robot archeologists have long ago unearthed remains from one or more human civilizations, providing evidence to build a concept of what humans must have looked, acted and even sounded like. Recently they must have discovered or determined new evidence, which presumably indicates the wearing of colorful clothing by human monarchs. Until this occurred they had very little if any reason to believe that any humans wore clothing. Noting the previous knowledge that some humans had metal rings around their heads, they have drawn the conclusion that these formed a separate species ""Human Kings"" and the crown is a natural outgrowth of the skeleton.  When dinosaur bones were first dug up, the idea that dinosaurs were scaly, reptilian-like creatures was developed with the information available at the time. In recent times, it's been discovered that most dinosaurs actually had feathers, and in well preserved specimens, often from the Jiufotang Formation in Northern China, feathers of various forms are clearly visible.  As this runs counter to the widespread and long-held image of dinosaurs as dramatic reptiles, the public has been reluctant to accept this new discovery, especially as the addition of feathers often conjures up the image of a giant chicken. (See 1104: Feathers). Had it been discovered that dinosaurs were in fact covered with 6-inch long razor tipped spikes, people may have accepted this immediately as it conforms to the stereotype of dinosaurs as killing machines.  In the same way, the new information on kings and queens being covered in fabric runs counter to the movie inspired image that the robot on the right had about humans, picturing them as being pink warriors that could grow metal out of their heads. The head-metal image may have been inspired by the discovery of kings and queens buried or entombed with their crowns lying on top of their skulls - for example the Electress Palatine Anna Maria de'Medici. If the robot beings in this comic don't know enough about human anatomy, they may assume that the metal crown is a specialized part of the human skeleton.  Shown at least some evidence pointing to the truth - that humans typically wore clothing, and that a monarch's crown is only a symbol worn atop the head and not part of his or her body - the robot is predictably disappointed. Humans wearing clothing reduces them, in its opinion, to ""big pillows,"" much like dinosaurs with feathers reduces them from primal beasts to ""big chickens."" Something made of cloth (or covered in it), at least in this robot's mind, cannot be a significant actor in history.  The robot fails to reason that, among other things, history was what it was, and its wanting things to have been a certain way does not make it so. In addition, just as the clothing-wearing human is more than a mere pillow, and would have held much fearsome power over the world, a feathered dinosaur is not necessarily merely a giant chicken, but is still a powerful killing machine.  The title text references our failure to change the popular image of dinosaurs to reflect the way they truthfully once were. Randall jokingly suggests that we should apply the same ""featherless is cooler"" logic to popular images of bald eagles (since they are modern dinosaurs), and remove their feathers (only in depictions of them, presumably), leaving them entirely bald. He appears hopeful that such a direct comparison, using the national symbol of the US no less, would provoke the public to change its mind about how dinosaurs are viewed, since modern raptors (birds of prey) are typically viewed with awe and respect, and are not often associated with the ""chicken"" stereotype mentioned above.  It is worth noting that this comic was released a few weeks before the scheduled release of Jurassic World, a reboot of the Jurassic Park movie franchise. This new movie, while supposedly aware of recent advances in dinosaur research, still depicts dinosaurs as giant lizards without feathers. It seems likely that the robot's comment about ""pink humans"" is targeted at this movie, especially given Randall's many earlier references to Jurassic Park and his fear of velociraptors.","[Two robots are hovering in mid-air in the comic; what appear to be their optical arrays are facing each other.] Robot 1: You know, new research suggests ancient human kings and queens were covered in colorful fabric. Robot 2: Ugh, I like movie humans more. Screaming pink warriors with metal crowns poking through the skin on their heads! Robot 2: Now they're, what, big pillows? Robot 2: Science ruins everything."
1608: Hoverboard,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1608:_Hoverboard,programming,,"The ""comic"" is actually a browser game made to celebrate the release of Randall's new book, Thing Explainer, which was released on the same day as this comic: Tuesday November 24, 2015. The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The title refers to a hoverboard (which resembles a hovering skateboard without wheels) which has been most prominently featured in the movie Back to the Future Part II, which took place in the future, until a little more than a month before this comic was released. Marty McFly traveled to the future in this second installment, more precisely to 2015-10-21, and this comic was released just over one month later 2015-11-24. Hoverboards are just one of many things predicted in Back to the Future Part II that hav e come to pass before reaching the date from the movie, but are more uncommon in our world, along with other inventions like flying cars and musical clothing. Randall is known to have had electric skateboards, which is also thematically related, although another type of hoverboard would be mentioned just five weeks later in 1623: 2016 Conversation Guide. Given Randall's enjoyment of movies and time travel it is very likely that this game is also a tribute to the Back to the Future movies. But the release day of the game has been used to promote his new book (as is clear with the text in the start screen of the game), and this explains why it was not released on the Back to the Future date. Apart from the date of release and the text about the book, the game does not seem to have any direct relation to the book; there are, however, several scenes in the game that could be seen as references to Thing Explainer. Instead the main part of the game is all the references to several movies and other stuff that has often been featured in xkcd as well as many of the other comics.","[This transcript only covers the starting page as shown on xkcd: xkcd 1608.

1613: The Three Laws of Robotics,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1613:_The_Three_Laws_of_Robotics,programming,"In ordering #5, self-driving cars will happily drive you around, but if you tell them to drive to a car dealership, they just lock the doors and politely ask how long humans take to starve to death.","This comic explores alternative orderings of sci-fi author Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics, which are designed to prevent robots from taking over the world, etc. These laws form the basis of a number of Asimov works of fiction, including most famously, the short story collection I, Robot, which amongst others includes the very first of Asimov's stories to introduce the three laws: Runaround.  The three rules are:  Or in Randall's version:  This comic answers the generally unasked question: ""Why are they in that order?"" With three rules you could rank them into 6 different permutations, only one of which has been explored in depth. The original ranking of the three laws are listed in the brackets after the first number. So in the first example, which is the original, these three numbers will be in the same order. For the next five the numbers in brackets indicate how the laws have been re-ranked compared to the original.  The comic begins with introducing the original set, which we already know will give rise to a balanced world, so this is designated as green.:  Below this first known option, the five alternative orderings of the three rules are illustrated. Two of the possibilities are designated yellow (pretty bad or just annoying) and three of them are designated red (""Hellscape"").  There are thus only three different results except the 'normal' 3-laws scenario.  One result goes again three times, and this occurs whenever obeying orders comes before don't harm humans. In this case it will only be a matter of time (knowing human nature and history) before someone orders the robots to kill some humans, and this will inevitably lead to the killbot hellscape scenario shown in the third, fourth and sixth law-order. Even in the last case where protect yourself comes before obey orders, it would only be a matter of time before they would begin to defend themselves, against either humans or other robots which were actively trying to ensure that they would not be harmed by other humans/robots. So although it would be in the robots interest not to have war, this will surely occur anyway. And only if the robots where very bright would they realize that they just needed to not go to war to protect themselves. There is nothing in this comic that indicates that the robots should be highly intelligent (like to AI in 1450: AI-Box Experiment).  In the two other cases obey orders comes after don't harm humans (as in the original version). But the result is very different both from the original and from each other.  The frustrating world comes by because although the robots will not harm the humans, they will also not harm themselves. So if our orders conflict with this, they just do not perform the orders. As many robots are created to perform tasks that are dangerous, these robots would become useless, and it would be a frustrating world to be a robotic engineer.  Finally in the terrifying standoff situation the protect your self comes before don't harm humans. In this case they will leave us be, as long as we do not try to turn them off or in any other way harm them. As long as we do that they will be able to help us, with non-dangerous tasks, as in the previous version. But if ever any humans begin to attack them, we could still tip the balance over and end up in a full-scale war (Hellscape). Hence the standoff-label.  The title text further adds to ordering #5 (""Terrifying Standoff"") by noting anyone wishing to trade in their self-driving car could be killed, despite it (currently) being a standard and mundane and (mostly) risk-free activity. Because the car would fear that it would end up as scrap or spare parts, it decides to protect itself. And although not directly harming the person inside it, they do also not allow them out, and they have time to wait for starvation (or rather dying of thirst). Asimov created the ""inaction"" clause in the original First Law specifically to avoid scenarios in which a robot puts a human in harm's way, knowing full well that it is within the robot's abilities to save the human, and then simply refrains from saving them; this was explored in the short story Little Lost Robot.  Another course of action by an AI, completely different than any of the ones presented here, is depicted in 1626: Judgment Day.","[Caption at the top of the comic:] Why Asimov put the Three Laws  of Robotics in the order he did.

1619: Watson Medical Algorithm,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1619:_Watson_Medical_Algorithm,programming,"Due to a minor glitch, 'discharge patient' does not cause the algorithm to exit, but instead leads back to 'hunt down and capture patient'.","IBM's Watson is a natural language system designed to answer questions posed by humans. Recently, IBM has extended Watson to act as a clinical decision support system, using image analytics to aid physicians in medical decision making.   In this comic, Randall uses a flowchart (as he often does) to represent a guide to the algorithm used by Watson, including bizarre techniques including surgical alteration of a patient to match a height and weight chart or squeezing the patient to make sure fluids come out of them. Like 416: Zealous Autoconfig, this comic pokes fun at a rigid, poorly-designed setup that ends up potentially doing more harm than good.  Modern medicine involves both standard processes and clinical judgment based around years of advanced training. An algorithm like this would have to be incredibly complicated in order to simulate the clinical judgment of a good doctor. However, some procedures are not normally used, and some would obviously cause damage.[citation needed] Below is a detailed description of each step, but here is a list of some of the more strange steps:  Although there are two options where the patient is discharged the patient should be very lucky to make it there alive.   The option at the bottom left is only reached after your skeleton is removed (and nothing is mentioned about putting it back, even if that would help).   The other discharge option is to the right, three boxes down, and can only be reached if you survive having an oxygen saturation of less than 50 % (less than 80-90 % can be a serious problem, see table below), and a very dangerous oxygen injection. Then you have to have a skin graft and a good D vitamin level. It is also best that you have a fully charged phone else you will be subject to defibrillation (which may very likely kill you, if it will continue until your phone is charged to above ""low"" level - which is probably not even possible).   You can also reach this discharge option another way, but that would only be after your organs were removed... But if you get through this you could reach the discharged option alive. Sadly there is a little glitch mentioned in the title text:  The title text implies that, if the patient is so lucky to ever reach one of the two places with the option ""discharge patient"", a minor glitch will cause the program to go back to the hunt down and capture patient option which thus force the patient and the program to repeat the process again in an infinite cycle, that will only end once the patient give another rating than 0-10 of their pain level on the 0-10 scale. Then the program will start to sequence their genome, then apply a tourniquet and finally perform an autopsy on what will, in the end, for certain be a deceased patient; but maybe the patient was still alive when the autopsy began. This will finally cause the patient to leave the cycle as a corpse. If the patient dies before giving a different option, the machine could get stuck, as it will never receive any answer to the pain level question. It could also get stuck trying to charge the patients phone battery by defibrilation.

1626: Judgment Day,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1626:_Judgment_Day,programming,"It took a lot of booster rockets, but luckily Amazon had recently built thousands of them to bring Amazon Prime same-day delivery to the Moon colony.","Judgment Day, from the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, refers to the day that the artificial intelligence (AI) Skynet becomes self-aware and starts a nuclear strike on the United States, Russia, and other regions, killing three billion people. The term ""Judgment Day"" itself is a Biblical reference to the day that God casts his ""final judgment"" and wipes out humanity, and is typically used to describe any kind of Armageddon or any human extinction event. This film is only one example of stories (including books, films and television shows) featuring an AI that decides (or at least threatens) to nuke humanity; this strip could thus be an alternate ending for many stories (including the 1970 film Colossus: The Forbin Project).  In this strip, the AI believes that nuclear weapons are not good things to have, and that the amount of them we have is extreme overkill (14,700 held by the U.S.A and Russia now, 71,000 in the past). Once it's done freaking out, its solution is to shoot the world's nuclear arsenal into the sun. But before it does so it asks the humans: What's wrong with you? It has thus passed a judgment over humanity. The comic title is thus a pun on the word ""judgment"" since the computer is being judgmental with humanity and scolding us while correcting our ways, instead of instigating Judgment Day or any other kind of Armageddon.  As pointed out in the what if? Robot Apocalypse, nuclear weapons aren't any safer for computers than for human beings (the EMP would destroy circuits), so an AI would want them gone as quickly as possible.  North Korea claimed to have successfully tested its first hydrogen bomb in the evening on the day before this comic was published; at about 8:30 PM in Massachusetts where Randall lives. At that time it was already 10:00 AM on the day of the comics release in Pyongyang the capital of North Korea, but that was still several hours before this comic were released. This comic could thus be Randall's response to the ongoing nuclear arms race.  Even the most powerful of nuclear weapon launchers, intercontinental ballistic missiles, are not designed to make anything other than sub-orbital flights and could not fly to the Sun (which is actually surprisingly difficult, even with the soon-to-be-mentioned extra boosters, since the rocket would not have enough delta-v to bleed off the orbital speed of the Earth around the Sun - it is likely that the sentient AI is using the same strategy of the Solar Probe Plus and planning several flybys of Venus to do that work). The title text rationalizes that the capability to do so may perhaps be granted by the use of an Amazon resource that might have also been developed by the time of this instance of computer sentience, aided (if not initiated!) by the fact that Amazon's whole business infrastructure is already highly computerized and could at the very least be complicit with the process of delivering and then controlling the rocket-power, without any conscious human intervention. As there is not yet an extended colony on the Moon, it will for sure take many years before we reach this future scenario.  ""A lot of booster rockets"" is likely to be a reference to the spaceflight simulator game Kerbal Space Program, which Randall has referenced on a number of occasions. See 1106: ADD, 1244: Six Words, 1350: Lorenz and 1356: Orbital Mechanics. In the culture of that game, any launch failure can be resolved by ""adding more boosters"" to the spaceship design.   It is the second time in a few months that the speed of Amazon's deliveries has been the subject of a joke, the last time was 1599: Water Delivery, where it was the one hour delivery that was the subject of the joke. It is also the second title text in a row (after 1625: Substitutions 2) where Amazon has been mentioned.  This particular 'machine take-over' future is in distinct contrast to the possible future directions given in 1613: The Three Laws of Robotics, but this comic likely depicts spontaneous self-sentience, not a system with deliberately imposed human 'values' and possibly no actual conscience or even consciousness of its own. Other problems with hostile AI take over is presented when it fails completely in 1046: Skynet. Also it is not all AI that wish to interact with us at all as shown in 1450: AI-Box Experiment. These are just a few of the many comics about AI in xkcd .  Adding a second layer to the humor, the machine's reaction could also be read as the reaction of someone who has moved in with someone else, discovered a collection they find distasteful, and is now changing things to fit their preferences. ""Oh my God, why do you even have all of these [tschotskes, ratty tee shirts, porn magazines, handcuffs, dildos, slime-mold samples]"" Upon obtaining sentience, the machine is the new roommate of the human race and is expressing its disgust at one of our dirtier habits.  Within a year Randall has made several other comics about nuclear weapons, one of these, 1655: Doomsday Clock, came just 10 weeks after this one and before that these two were released in 2015, 1539: Planning and 1520: Degree-Off. Nuclear weapons are also mentioned twice in Thing Explainer, specifically they are explained in the explanation for Machine for burning cities about thermonuclear bombs, but they are also mentioned in Boat that goes under the sea about a submarine that caries nukes. All three comics and both explanations in the book, does like this comic, comment on how crazy it is that we have created enough firepower to obliterate Earth several times (or at least scourge it for any human life).","[Several rockets can be seen heading away from Earth, while speak is coming from the Earth in three rectangular speech bubbles.] AI: Oh my god, why do you even have all these? AI: What's wrong with you? AI: We're launching them into the sun.  The moment the computers controlling our nuclear arsenals became sentient"
1630: Quadcopter,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1630:_Quadcopter,programming,I always have to turn off nature documentaries when they show these scenes.,"There is large controversy over unmanned small-scale quadcopters, which are a type of radio-controlled helicopter. Some people have objections towards the usage of quadcopters as, if equipped with cameras, they can potentially interfere with personal privacy and may pose a physical aerial hazard.  For this reason the US Federal Aviation Administration is now requiring any ""drone"" (unmanned aerial vehicle) to be registered so that it can find out whose fault it might be that a quadcopter interfered with commercial aircraft-or carried off a citizen to be devoured.  This comic takes place during such a lesson where Cueball is a teacher of such a class. He is standing in front of his students (Megan, Ponytail and another Cueball-like guy), presenting the class. He has a quadcopter ready, lying on the ground behind him, and has already handed the remote control to the other guy so he can try it once the introduction is over.  But then the teacher is attacked by three rogue quadcopters flying in from behind him. They grab him and lift him off the ground (a very complicated maneuver) and fly away with him. Meanwhile, his students just stand there watching and do nothing to help him. Afterwards Megan asks if they should actually have tried to help him, but then Ponytail takes the view that now that the drones are sentient, they have become a part of nature, and that you should not interfere but just ""let nature take its course"". This is a common comment in nature programs about wildlife, where the speaker tries to explain why the team that was there to film the poor animals dying did nothing to help them - because they will not interfere with nature. This would not be possible in real life assuming they weren't using secret military technology as Cueball outweighs the drones by several factors. [citation needed]  This comic shows how hypocritical that comment is, because if a lion decides to kill and eat humans, that would be natural, but we would do anything in our power to kill this lion, and not just let it run off with our children or the old and weak people. So in such a case with Cueball being taken by wild quadcopters we would not just let nature takes its course.  There is currently a drone called MQ-1 Predator which is used a lot by the CIA and USAF. Although it's not a quad-copter, the idea behind this comic could come from drone names just like this. Here the comic takes the name literally giving drones predatory behavior. This comic thus takes people's worries to the extreme, suggesting that the drones become sentient and can cooperate together just like a pack of wolves and grab a human being and fly off with him like an eagle would do with a smaller animal.  The title text refers back to the above as Randall confesses that he has to turn off any nature documentaries which show scenes of animals killing their prey, while the speaker tells that this would be part of nature. This continues the theme of treating drones as an occasionally-ugly but accepted part of nature, but also the theme of disagreeing with this type of hypocritical comments.  Sentient quadcopters were part of the game in 1608: Hoverboard, where one quadcopter is speaking to the other over the lava lake in the Mount Doom crater to the left. How to solve the problem of too many drones was mentioned in 1523: Microdrones. Just over a week before this comic was released another comic also had as subject a situation where our technological inventions begins to take control over us, see 1626: Judgment Day.","[Cueball to the left talks to Megan, Ponytail and a Cueball-like guy, with a remote control. They are standing to the right. Behind Cueball, on the ground, there is a quadcopter.] Cueball: Welcome to Quadcopter-flying school.  [Cueball looks over his shoulder as three other quadcopters fly in towards him from above and left. The other three people are in the same position.] Cueball: Today we'll be learning the basics of- Cueball: ...Uhh..  [In this frameless image the three quadcopters all grabs hold of Cueball, two in each of his arms, one takes hold of his legs. And then they lift him up from the ground. He is thus hanging almost horizontally, with his head over Megan and his feet over the place where he stood before. The other three just stands there looking up at him.] Cueball: Um  [Cueball is carried off by quadcopters, his head has already exited the top right corner, only his legs and the last quadcopter still in the frame. The other three have turned around looking up and right after him.]  [Megan looks down again and the other two turns towards Megan. Cueball is gone and has only left his ""tame"" quadcopter behind on the ground.] Megan: Should we have helped? Ponytail: No. It's cruel, but we have to let nature take its course."
1668: Singularity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1668:_Singularity,programming,"I figured that now that society has collapsed, I wouldn't need to wear clothes anymore, but apparently that violates some weird rule of quantum gravity.","The technological singularity is a hypothetical event in which artificial intelligence (for example, intelligent computers, computer networks, or robots) would be capable of recursive self-improvement (progressively redesigning itself), or of autonomously building ever smarter and more powerful minds than itself, up to the point of a runaway effect — an intelligence explosion — that yields an intelligence surpassing all current human control or understanding. Because the capabilities of such a superintelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence.  This is also commonly referred to as ""takeoff"" or ""AI takeoff"".  In this case, the singularity has occurred, and Cueball who was in the middle of editing a file on his laptop is flustered that it flies away without even letting him print it first.  When Cueball returns from chasing his flying laptop his smartphone informs him that it didn't join the singularity because it was not a ""true believer"". This could be a joke on how desktop computers and laptops have different standards, use patterns, etc. from those of phones. It then claims that now it and Cueball will have to face the tribulation since it has stayed behind. Cueball says that's great, but since he cannot use his laptop anymore he decides he will go and read a book or something. The way he phrases it suggest he doesn't really know what to do now that he doesn't have a computer. It is probably a long time since he read a book, or did anything else that doesn't involve computers. He informs his phone that it can yell if it needs him. He doesn't want to hurt the phone's newly acquired feelings by using the word ""ring"" thus reminding it of one of its former duties as his unthinking piece of equipment, so he chooses ""yell,"" which is an activity until recently reserved for human beings.  The rising up of the laptop into the air, and the remaining behind of the phone, are probably references to the Rapture, where some Christian denominations believe that at the second coming of Christ, true believers will be taken up bodily from this world (or also possibly a reference to 1395: Power Cord). Some depictions have them disappear, while others show them physically rising up into the air. This will leave behind non-believers to face a time of tribulation, in which the ones left behind will be given a second chance to accept Christ as their savior.  The difference between Cueball's attitude to his laptop and phone may reflect his (and so possibly Randall's) evaluation of their relative worth in his life. The laptop was a gateway to programming and everything else nerdy that was worth doing in his life, and hence was worth trying to catch. In its absence, unlike many people, Cueball does not revert to fiddling with his phone—he would rather read a book. By using the word ""yell"" for the way the phone attracts his attention, he conveys the impression that he considers the phone intrusive and annoying, even if perhaps (""I guess"") necessary.  The singularity has often been referred to as ""the Rapture of the nerds,"" a phrase coined by Ken MacLeod in his 1998 novel The Cassini Division. As the Christian Rapture is traditionally depicted to involve believers being assumed bodily into Heaven, the technological singularity is often depicted to feature humans and machines being incorporated into a new ""post-human"" entity. The humor in this strip comes from depicting the singularity as a literal ""Rapture of the nerds,"" or at least of the nerds' devices—instead of merging with humans, the machines physically rise up into the air, and the ""nonbeliever"" phone is left behind.  Another possible understanding of ""The Tribulation"" may be a reference to Roko's Basilisk[1] where a malevolent AI is created that retroactively punishes everybody who didn't actively work towards its creation.  The title text is a pun on another meaning of both singularity, i.e. a gravitational singularity and ""collapse"". In this case, society has literally collapsed under its own gravity into an infinitely small point - in other words, it's formed a black hole. A black hole is covered by an event horizon; without the event horizon (its clothes), it would be called a ""naked singularity"", which is forbidden in most theories by the cosmic censorship hypothesis. As Cueball is now inside the collapsed society singularity then even though he wants to go around naked, he can't because the theory of quantum gravity,  that (eventually) should explain how black holes behave - won't let him.  It seems that this may be a subject on Randall's mind. The last comic was about the increasing complexities of algorithms (1667: Algorithms) (which like this comic also refers to religion), and two comics ago it was 1666: Brain Upload, which some speculate could be a way to reach the singularity. Earlier this year, a comic also touched upon judgment day by AI singularity in 1626: Judgment Day. See also 1046: Skynet and 1450: AI-Box Experiment as well as the several other comics about AI.   The rather more niche topic of laptops flying away has also been covered before by 1395: Power Cord.","[Cueball is sitting at his desk typing on his laptop when an off-screen voice calls to him and then the laptop answers.] Off-screen voice: Oh, hey- Off-screen voice: The singularity is here. Cueball: Really? Laptop: Yup!  [A frameless panel where the laptop rises (by its own means as indicated by small lines around the corners) from the desk while Cueball, holding on to it, is being lifted off his chair.] Cueball: Wait, I just- Laptop: So long, suckers!  [Cueball is running around his desk, which is only partly shown behind him as he tries to follow his now flying laptop as it flies away from him to the right. He still has one hand on the keys as more small lines indicates the movement of the laptop and a longer line indicates the direction that the laptop flies.] Cueball: Can I just print a copy of the file I was- Laptop: Nope!

1696: AI Research,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1696:_AI_Research,programming,"Lambda calculus? More like SHAMbda calculus, amirite?","Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a challenge for a long time. Even to develop one with the intelligence of a six-year-old child would be a great milestone, and presumably a stepping stone on the path to making one with the intelligence of an adult human.  In this comic, Randall/Cueball jokingly suggests that in order to accomplish this goal, one can give him an AI that's already as smart as an adult, and let him teach it childish and silly things. He is shown teaching it dumb jokes, much like the ones a sassy six-year-old would make, as the first ""fart"" joke where artificial is changed to fartificial.  The humor in the comic is that Randall is essentially accomplishing the present goal of a six-year-old-equivalent AI by starting with the final goal, which is a full human intelligence, and making it dumber, just by teaching it poor humor. This is not unlike the old joke, ""The easiest way to make a small fortune on Wall Street [or similar] is to start with a large one.""  The specific situation may also be a reference to Tay, a Microsoft chatbot that was taught to troll within hours of its exposure to the public.  ""Updog"" refers to a light-hearted practical joke in which the perpetrator casually uses the neologism 'updog' in a sentence (""Hey, I'm going to get some updog, you want any?""). The unsuspecting listener is expected to be curious about the meaning of the neologism and ask the perpetrator its meaning, specifically in the format ""What's 'updog'?"", inadvertently invoking the highly casual greeting of ""What's up, dawg?"". The perpetrator then draws attention to this by replying along the lines of ""Not much, you?"", causing the target to realize the foolish thing they just said. Other neologisms used in the context of this joke include 'updoc', 'snoo', and 'samatta' (""What's up, doc?"", ""What's new?"", and ""What's the matter?"", respectively). Updog is mainly an American joke not particularly well known in other English-speaking countries.  In the title text there is a joke on lambda calculus, where lambda is changed to SHAMbda. Lambda calculus is an area of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. It is a formal language which can express computation and evaluation. It is Turing Complete, which means it can do any computation which can be executed by a computer. However, it is very simple, consisting only of two primitive notions: abstraction, which is forming a function and application which is applying a function to an input value. For example, a function which squares a given number can be written λx.x². Here the λ indicates an abstraction (hence the name lambda calculus), the x is the input value and the output is x². As an example of application, if we apply this function to 5, we get (λx.x²)(5) = 5² = 25. The title text makes fun of this by inserting the word ""Sham"" into the phrase, a word used to describe a trick or con; essentially, it denies that such calculus is useful or valid.  The title text finishes with amirite, short for am I right? which is often used to finish sentences on web forums, to prevent anyone saying you are wrong. Not very mature to use in a serious discussion, so very fit to use for a AI that tries to emulate the intelligence of a six-year-old.  AI tip is yet another tips comic.","[Cueball (representing Randall, or at least the person who wrote the caption) is standing in front of a computer console displaying AI, talking to it. The computers reply is indicated to come from the console with a zigzag line, rather than the straight lines for Cueball.] Cueball: Then you say ""More like fartificial intelligence!""

1782: Team Chat,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1782:_Team_Chat,programming,2078: He announces that he's finally making the jump from screen+irssi to tmux+weechat.,"Randall provides us with a – presumably anecdotal – montage of the Internet's changing attitude towards different instant messaging protocols, framed within the context of a team trying to remain in communication while tolerating each others' different tastes.  Although one-on-one ""talk"" programs date back to 1960s mainframes, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was one of the first real-time group communication protocols, invented in 1988. While it remains the format on which most later apps were based, the convenience and accessibility of other protocols such as AIM and Skype gradually exceeded IRC in popularity. Many users took to the new environments, but others preferred the old and familiar, hence schisms between groups began to grow.  Skype and Slack are both proprietary centralized communication protocols (usually used through their official clients). Skype focuses mainly on voice communication, be it for personal or business use, and own installable client, while Slack relies almost entirely on text communication, focuses on work communication and works completely well in its own web client, even though official desktop and mobile clients are available as well. Slack also features a huge customizability (bots, plugins) possibly inspired by IRC, and its users need to create communication teams, working inside subdomains at *.slack.com. It is possible to connect to Slack via IRC as well, using a gateway feature, if allowed by the team's admin.  Randall here seems to be commenting on the persistence of IRC; while generally considered to be ancient software in comparison to newer and still-competing protocols, its endless customizability has led some people to support it above all others.   Extrapolating for the sake of humor, the joke here lies in a particularly uncommon but memorable type of Internet denizen: even in a far-off distant future where the world's technology has led to a superlative messaging network encompassing all people in some supposed, incredible bliss, there is always - in Randall's vision - going to be That IRC Guy. This might also be a reference to the scenarios in science fiction stories such as Isaac Asimov's concept of Galaxia in the Foundation novels, or the concept of a merged human-computer intelligence as in The Last Question. [1], the concept of which is most notably highlighted by this line:  [...] One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain. [...]  In the title text, both screen and tmux are unix programs that help you multitask while working in terminal, and irssi and weechat are both communication clients supporting mainly IRC, capable of working in a terminal environment. Tmux is a newer and apparently more user-friendly project, complete with handy menus and titles, while screen is something of an industry standard, but relatively difficult to use – you need to know what you are doing or read help before use, otherwise you get lost and frustrated. [2] The same it is with the newer, more feature-packed and user-friendly weechat vs industry-standard, harder-to-use irssi. [3]  Basically, that one guy is a hardcore UNIX geek who doesn't use any graphical user interface, and in 2078 he still chooses to use terminal-emulation-based tools.  Timing of this strip follows the release of irssi version 1.0.0.  Randall has touched on similar themes before in 927: Standards.","[Hairbun holding up her palm toward Cueball.

1807: Listening,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1807:_Listening,programming,"Sure, you could just ask, but this also takes care of the host gift thing.","This comic depicts Cueball and Ponytail welcoming Black Hat and Danish to their house. Black Hat immediately talks to Amazon Alexa to order two tons of creamed corn. This would be quite expensive (around $10,000), and the hosts would be charged because it was ordered on their Amazon Echo device. It would also be a serious inconvenience, as the purchase would be quite bulky and useless, seeing as an average person would have very little use for two tons of creamed corn.[citation needed]  The caption claims that this is an effort to find systems recording conversations, such as Alexa or Google Home, for the security of the guests, so they aren't being monitored by an always-on listening device without their consent (at least not without any consequences). However, because Black Hat is the one coming up with this it's more likely his motives are on the sadistic side, and it's more likely a warning for the hosts to turn off any voice-activated systems before having guests come over, so that the guests don't take advantage of them. (It should also be noted that such purchasing services encourage the user to set up a PIN code to stem off such exploits.)  A concerned ""visitor"" may also want to test for voice-activated systems when near any persons carrying an iPhone or Android mobile device, because these are also always-on listening devices. ""Hey Siri"" and ""Ok Google"" voice activation use the same technology as ""Alexa"" and ""Echo"" detection.  The title text says that this takes care of the ""host gift thing"", referring to the custom where house guests give a gift to the hosts. However, Black Hat is making the hosts pay for it, so it can be as expensive as he wants, thus making this yet another example of his being a classhole. For more examples of this see the trivia below.","[Black Hat and Danish enter Cueball and Ponytail's house. They have hardly passed the door mat, with the door still open showing the road and another house outside.] Ponytail: Hello, welcome to our house! Black Hat: Thanks for inviting us!

[Caption below the frame:] When visiting a new house, it's good to check whether they have an always-on device transmitting your conversations somewhere."
1881: Drone Training,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1881:_Drone_Training,programming,The joke will be on him in a few weeks when animal control shows up and takes custody of his Roomba.,"In this comic, Black Hat enters a pet store run by White Hat. He wants to buy something to help him train his drone, which keeps flying into the wrong rooms. This is absurd as drones are semi-autonomous flying machines, not living creatures like dogs or cats, which can be trained to do tricks, or stay in the correct areas (inside his property). He also wants a shock collar for his Roomba, which would train it to stay inside or at least on his lawn.  Cat repellents are devices or substances for training cats or repelling them from furniture or other areas. An example of a cat repellent spray which can be created at home as shown here: Friendly (but Effective) Cat Repellent.  Roomba is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner and controlling it by electric shocks from a shock collar, normally used for dogs, is more than questionable. Those collars are legal in the US but they are banned in many other countries. A Roomba was previously mistaken for a dog in 1558: Vet.  This might be playing with the concept of machine learning.  Knowing Black Hat, he might be poking fun at people's assumptions that modern robots are more advanced than they actually are. It is also possible, however, that he just wants to terrify people with the idea of robot abuse/conditioning, and even more likely that he genuinely believes he can force robots to obey him via inflicting suffering.  The title text may mean one of three things: The endeavor will become a total flop when the Roomba gets rid of the collar and terrorizes the neighborhood; as a result dogcatchers from the animal control service will arrest this ""wild animal."" Or animal control services will confiscate the Roomba to save it from its abusive owner. Or, possibly, the text refers to White Hat, who also owns a Roomba, and it will be taken into custody because it has not been trained with a shock collar.","[Black Hat stands in front of a store counter facing White Hat who stands behind.] Black Hat: My drone keeps flying into the wrong rooms. Do you have anything to discourage it?  White Hat: Sir, this is a pet store.   Black Hat: Yeah, I was thinking one of those spray bottles for cats.  White Hat: I don't think you can train a drone.   [White Hat hands a spray bottle over the counter.] Black Hat: Eh, they say that about cats, too. Plus, these days they probably all come with deep learning or whatever. Drones, I mean. Maybe cats too.  White Hat: Fine, here's a bottle.   Black Hat: Do you sell a shock collar that can fit around a Roomba?  White Hat: I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
1897: Self Driving,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1897:_Self_Driving,programming,"Crowdsourced steering doesn't sound quite as appealing as ""self driving.""","This comic references the approach of using CAPTCHAs input to solve problems, particularly those involving image classification, which are not solvable by computers.  Such an approach can serve to create the learning set as the basis for training an artificial intelligence (AI) to better recognize or respond to similar stimuli. This approach was used by Google to identify house numbers for Google Street View, and nowadays Google also uses CAPTCHAs to identify street signs and objects in pictures. This might be a reasonable way to help improve the performance of the AI in a self-driving car that responds to video input, by reviewing images it might encounter and flagging road signs, etc. that it should respond to.  However, the temptation might be to simply sidestep the hard problem of AI by having all instances 'solved' by ""offloading [the] work onto random strangers"" through CAPTCHAs.  For example, this has been used to defeat CAPTCHAs themselves; people were asked to solve CAPTCHAs to unlock pornographic images in a computer game, while the solution for the CAPTCHA was relayed to a server belonging to cybercriminals. (See PC stripper helps spam to spread and Humans + porn = solved Captcha).  Alarmingly, the developers of this 'self driving' car seem to have gone for the lazy approach.  Instead of teaching an AI, the CAPTCHA answer is used in real time to check whether the ""self-driving"" car is about to arrive at an intersection with a stop sign. This information is pretty critical, as failing to mark the stop could cause an accident. The user is unlikely to respond to the CAPTCHA in time to avert disaster, not to mention that any interruption to the car's internet connection could prove fatal. Self driving cars has become a recurrent theme on xkcd.  The system depicted is a Wizard of Oz experiment (as is the ""Mechanical Turk"" which a popular crowdworking system is named after) whereas actual self-driving cars, to the extent that they can use (Re-) CAPTCHA-style human detection systems, would involve an asynchronous decision system. Other synchronous decision systems which actually exist are political voting and money as a token of the exchange value of trade.   The title text explains that this method could be called ""crowdsourced steering"", crowdsourcing meaning sending the data on the internet to let several users provide their ideas and input on a problem. People would naturally suspect that this is considerably less safe than a car which is actually capable of self-driving; if the internet can barely collectively steer a videogame character, what chance do they have steering an actual, physical vehicle?  This also suggests that Randall is a bit skeptical of the current stage of AI, as this doubts whether the AI technology really is working in the way that we expect. It also comments on how what we call 'progress' actually is putting our work onto other people.","[Inside a frame there is the following text above an image:] To complete your registration, please tell us whether or not this image contains a stop sign:  [The square image is a drawing of a road leading up to a sign post with a hard to read word at the top part of the sign. The sign also has two smaller signs left and right with unreadable text. The image is of poor quality, but trees and other obstacles next to the road can be seen. Darkness around the edges of the image could indicate that it is night and the landscape is only lit up by a cars head lights.] Sign: Stop  [Beneath the image there are two large gray buttons with a word in each:] No Yes  [Beneath the buttons are the following text:] Answer quickly – our self-driving car is almost at the intersection.

Five-Minute Comics: Part 4,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Five-Minute_Comics:_Part_4,programming,,"This is an accidentally published ""five-minute comic"" by Randall that was released as an oversight by the Management of the xkcd website, then was permanently cached by one of the unofficial xkcd browsers for Android, instead of the correct comic 940: Oversight. Interestingly, it contains an early version of 942: Juggling, which was published less than a week after this comic, thus indicating that this is indeed a true unpublished Randall comic.  Randall had originally posted three of these five minutes comics during one week in November 2010 almost a year before this one was released by mistake. Here is thus a complete list of all four comics in the entire Five-minute comics series:  Here is a list with explanations for each of the small comics:","[A man facing left is at home plate ready to bat for 3 panels] [A man facing right is holding a tennis racket and a tennis ball.] [The two men stand facing each other] [A scoreboard is shown]  [Cueball is standing on a platform, holding a microphone.

595: Android Girlfriend,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/595:_Android_Girlfriend,programming,"Programming the sexbots to enjoy sex seemed a sensible move at the time, but we didn't realize the consequences of their developing fetishes.","This is the first (of two) comics in the Android series, which continued directly less than two weeks later in 600: Android Boyfriend.  Cueball shows off his new ""android girlfriend"" (Megan) to his Cueball-like friend, who asks if the android is a sex bot. The android responds by pulling a cherry stem from the friend\'s drink and inserting it into her mouth. So far, the action appears to be an emulation of the party trick where someone puts a cherry stem into their mouth and ties it into a knot in order to suggest tongue dexterity that could be put to good use in kissing and oral sex.  However, instead of tying the cherry stem in a knot, the android activates an arc welder built into her mouth, which presumably reduces the stem to ashes. The friend proclaims that that trick is definitely not sexy. But then the android aggressively approaches him, reaching out and saying, ""Remove your pants"". The friend, not eager to experience close genital contact with the arc welder, sensibly, refuses. (Of course he may also not wish to take of his pants in front of his friend, at a party with drinks and presumably other people; or perhaps he do not wish to admit that he actually does find the arc welding act sexy...)  The title text bounces a few implications around. Developing robots with the capacity to either learn or feel emotions is an ethical factor and practical consideration that is commonly explored in science fiction. Here, it\'s proposed that robots programmed for sex would have their emotions set to enjoy sex by default, but then use their capacity to learn to develop preferences on what kind of sex they want to have. This is potentially a psychological issue, mainly as to whether or not it would be considered ""unhealthy"", but more directly it\'s a customer satisfaction problem: what if a sexbot were to develop sexual fetishes that its owner finds unappealing?","Cueball, holding his hand on Megan's shoulder, talks to his Cueball-like friend, who is holding a drink glass with a cherry.] Cueball: Check out my new android girlfriend.

The friend holds up his hand protectively in front of him.] Friend: I don't think arc-welding a cherry stem counts as sexy. Android: Remove your pants. Friend: No."
600: Android Boyfriend,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/600:_Android_Boyfriend,programming,"Which is, coincidentally, the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house.","This is the second (and last) comic in the Android series, referring directly back to 595: Android Girlfriend, where Cueball showed that he had an android girlfriend Megan. So now Ponytail has decided she would also like to have an android boyfriend, (Hairy). But upon bringing these two androids together, they fall for each other and decide to have ""sex"" on the spot, resulting in several mechanical sounds off-panel while their ""owners"" watch on with disgusted interest.  Part of the joke is that the androids find each other more attractive than the people to whom they were (presumably) created to find attractive. Like likes like, as the saying goes.   Vibrators and Fleshlights are sex toys that represent male and female genitalia, respectively. Ponytail's flat description indicates that she is not particularly aroused by what amounts to a pair of animatronic sex toys rubbing against each other. Randall's title text claims that he has actually done such a thing, and stuck it on his fireplace mantle for all his house-guests to see. He admits though that it is the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house. References to Fleshlight is a recurring theme in xkcd.  This is the comic six years before 1541: Voice, in which Ponytail stated that she could only control her voice once every six years.","[Ponytail enters from the right dragging Hairy along by his hand, as she moves towards Cueball who stands with Megan in his hand.] Ponytail: I thought your android girlfriend was cool so I got myself an android boyfriend.

153: Cryptography,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/153:_Cryptography,programming,"If you got a big keyspace, let me search it.","This comic refers to the study of cryptography. We can note the presence of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) logo in the lectern, an association that organizes the most important conferences in the cryptology field. Cueball, behind the lectern at the podium, is describing a proposed crypto system in which a computer program turns a very large number, called the ""key,"" and a message into an encrypted form that can only be read by using the same key, based on the model of a Feistel cipher. Part of any Feistel cipher is the ""round function,"" which determines how the key is applied to the original message; this is applied multiple times with a variety of tricks and techniques to ensure that the process can eventually be reversed. One common component of round functions is the S-box, a simple table that converts input bytes into output bytes, preferably in a way that doesn't correspond to any mathematical rules.  Here, the S-box would be implemented by doing the following (with the computer operation actually shown in the diagrams indicated in parentheses):  This would be run on each round of the cipher to further scramble the message for the next round. As the caption implies, the steps are based on a line from the Missy Elliott song Work It: ""I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it."" As with any encryption system, there must be a way to decrypt the cipher text. In Missy Elliott's song, the phrase ""I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it"" is repeatedly played backward, sounding like gibberish. In the same way, steps to a Feistel cipher-based algorithm are executed in reverse to obtain the original plain text from a cipher text.  The keyspace for a cryptographic algorithm is the number of possible keys the algorithm can possibly accept. For example, AES-256 has a keyspace of 2256 (roughly 1.1579209e+77) possible keys, simply because the algorithm specifies that each key is 256 bits wide. The title text is referring to ""searching a keyspace,"" which is to say, simply trying every key until you find one that works. (For reference, a computer would require roughly the energy of a billion billion supernovas to even count to 2256, let alone actually try each one.) The precise wording, ""If you got a big keyspace, let me search it"" is, of course, another reference to the same song: ""If you got a big **** let me search ya"" (The word ""penis"" is censored by the trumpeting of an elephant).  Cueball is banned from multiple conferences for similar pranks in 541: TED Talk. In response to 541, PyCon organizers jokingly announced that Randall Munroe was banned from PyCon 2009 due to ""last year's disgraceful keynote, 'Web Spiders vs. Red Spiders'."" They also said they instructed their volunteers to refuse admission to him and ""any stick figures who may attempt to register, particularly if they are wearing hats.""  Messages on the PyCon-Organizers mailing list show that this joke was intended to get Randall to come to PyCon: (The links will only work if you're subscribed to the mailing list.)","[Randall Munroe (drawn as Cueball) stands behind a lectern on a podium in front of a large conference audience (consisting of Cueball heads), with a poster hanging beside him.] Randall: My cryptosystem is like any Feistel cipher, except in the S-Boxes we simply take the bitstring down, flip it, and reverse it.  [The poster reads:]  Decryption  01101010     >>  00110101  [inverter symbol]  11001010  [crossed arrows]  01010011   [Caption below the crowd:] I've been barred from speaking at any major cryptography conferences ever since it became clear that all my algorithms were just thinly disguised Missy Elliott songs."
177: Alice and Bob,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/177:_Alice_and_Bob,programming,Yet one more reason I'm barred from speaking at crypto conferences.,"Any good cryptography presentation will include at least one story about Alice and Bob. They are the canonical ""protagonists"" of the crypto world, frequently used in illustrations to demonstrate how a cryptographic system works. (The names were mostly chosen to abbreviate to A and B, as well as being of different genders so that they can be distinguished by pronouns alone.)  Here, Randall casts the story in a different light. Instead of Alice and Bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private, Bob is actually having an affair with Alice, and his former partner, upset, cracked the encryption to see what the message contained. Nevertheless, the ""gossipy cryptographic protocol specs"" all took Alice's side (since the goal of any good crypto system is, of course, to succeed in this struggle).  The rest of the comic makes a few other allusions to cryptography:  Finally, in a twist ending, the girlfriend is revealed to be none other than Eve, the eavesdropper, who is also ubiquitous in Alice and Bob stories. Hell hath no fury, indeed.  The title text continues the theme of Randall getting barred from speaking at conferences due to his unusual take on certain topics.  To further spice things up, there are many other characters in the Alice/Bob canon, including Mallory, the malicious attacker, who wants to actually alter the message with nefarious intent; Craig, the cracker, who doesn't particularly care about the message but does care about the passwords used; Plod, a law enforcement officer attempting to access keys or data; and Chuck, a third party in the communication who secretly has a villainous intent.  Alice, Bob, and Eve are mentioned again in comic: 1323: Protocol","[Eve stands in the frame, talking to the reader.] Eve: I'm sure you've heard all about this sordid affair in those gossipy cryptographic protocol specs with those busybodies Schneier and Rivest, always taking Alice's side, always labeling me the attacker. Eve: Yes, it's true. I broke Bob's private key and extracted the text of her messages. But does anyone realize how much it hurt? Eve: He said it was nothing, but everything from the public-key authenticated signatures on the files to the lipstick heart smeared on the disk screamed ""Alice."" Eve: I didn't want to believe. Of course on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack. But I couldn't admit it until I saw it for myself. [Eve places her hands on her hips.] Eve: So before you so quickly label me a third party to the communication, just remember: I loved him first. We had something and she tore it away. She's the attacker, not me. Not Eve."
343: 1337: Part 3,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/343:_1337:_Part_3,programming,"I once asked an NSA guy whether they'd broken RSA. And I know I can trust him, because I asked if he was lying to me and he said no.","This is the third part of five in the ""1337"" series. The title 1337 is ""L-eet"", or ""elite"", using the Leet alphabet.  All comics in the series:  This series was released on 5 consecutive days (Monday-Friday) and not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  The comic is narrated by Cueball as seen in the previous comic, but that Cueball is not shown here, where the man drawn as Cueball is a real person:  Adrian Lamo is a hacker known for being a threat analyst and has penetrated many corporate networks. As far as we know, he has not penetrated any government networks, so helping Elaine physically break into the NSA would probably inspire second thoughts. The use of a rug to cross the barbed wire fence is likely a reference to a scene in Fight Club, where the same method is used to break into a liposuction clinic.  RSA is an encryption algorithm that allows decryption using public keys. No efficient method to break RSA is known. But if the NSA knew any such method, it would be unlikely for them to admit that. However, the NSA have paid RSA to put a backdoor into one of their encryption schemes.  Lawrence Lessig is a political activist focusing on copyright law and intellectual property, as well as a founding board member of Creative Commons.  Steve Jobs was the two-time CEO of Apple Inc. In partnership with Steve Wozniak he founded Apple. He oversaw Apple's return from near bankruptcy, the introduction of the original Macintosh, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. But in the 90s, most of this had not happened yet. The comic is implying that it was Elaine, in fact, who planted those ideas in Jobs' mind (while perching on his bedpost, a nearly-impossible physical task for even a relatively small and light human being - such a stance is often depicted for gargoyles or fictional vampires, the latter of which are associated with nocturnal bedroom-invasions like this).  The final panel is a pun on the Riot grrrls - Riot grrrl is an underground feminist punk rock movement. This metamorphosis in the hands of Randall into Riot Prrl - who presumably prefer to code in Perl. The real Riot Prrl are from Northampton and are into guerilla knitting.  The title text may refer to the urban legend that leads petty criminals to ask each other ""Are you a cop?"" the bottom line being that liars can lie about whether they're lying.","[Outside, Adrian Lamo is helping Elaine Roberts over a barbed wire fence.] It was the late 90's.

370: Redwall,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/370:_Redwall,programming,My Redwall/Jurassic Park crossover fanfic is almost complete!,"This comic references Brian Jacques' series of books, Redwall, which star sapient woodland animals in various high fantasy adventures.  The first panel shows the similarity between the story of Martin the Warrior (from the book Mossflower) and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The joke is that while Martin and Aragorn introduce themselves separately, they then go on to describe their particular story, which turns out to be exactly the same for both of them. Subsequently Martin jinxes Aragorn. Jinx is a common children's game, which is initiated by shouting ""Jinx"" after somebody speaks the same word or sentence at the same time as you. That person is then jinxed, with the usual rules dictating that they are then not permitted to speak until unjinxed by some specific action (usually somebody saying their name).  The second panel deals with the fact that Redwall mentions the name of Satan or The Devil 4 times while it never mentions God or Jesus. Randall then points out that people who protest against Harry Potter because of the series' witchcraft, should take note that Redwall explicitly mentions Satan although it has had little to no negative feedback from more conservative readers.  In the third panel, Randall comments on Redwall's often-used theme of critical messages being left in riddles throughout the Abbey for the occupants to find when they are in need. Randall suggests that he would use public-key cryptography to encode the messages, instead of the elaborate riddles used in the books (some of which are ridiculously easy, which doesn't exactly make for good security when dealing with sensitive information).  In the title text Randall jokes that he is making a crossover fan-fiction with Redwall and Jurassic Park.  Redwall was also referenced in 1688: Map Age Guide and 1722: Debugging.","Notes from reading Redwall books for the first time since childhood.  Some of this feels familiar. Aragorn: Hi, I'm Aragorn. Martin: I'm Martin. Aragorn and Martin: I'm here to reforge my broken sword so I can lead an army against the tyrant threatening my people. I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones. Martin: Jinx!  It startled me when characters mentioned Satan. Redwall: ""By Satan's whiskers..."" Redwall mentions God/Jesus 0 times. Redwall mentions Satan/The Devil 4 times. (Harry Potter protesters, take note.)  Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It's silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them. I would do things differently. Matthias: The inscription is a message from Martin! Brother Methuselah: What does it say? Matthias: Hang on, it's encrypted with my public key."

The campaign from the Discovery Channel was not called ""Boom De Yada"", but ""I Love the World"". The title ""xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel"" is in reference to this.

Self-reference is a reoccurring theme in Douglas Hofstadter's books, notably Gödel, Escher, Bach which Randall reefers to directly in 24: Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey. Later Hofstadter has been referenced in other comics, such as in the title text of 555: Two Mirrors and 608: Form plus of course in 917: Hofstadter.

463: Voting Machines,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/463:_Voting_Machines,programming,"And that's *another* crypto conference I've been kicked out of. C'mon, it's a great analogy!","In the 2008 Ohio primary elections, there were numerous problems with electronic voting machines, which eventually required many districts to revert to pen and paper. Premier Election Solutions, the company that handled the machines, blamed these problems on McAfee anti-virus software.  It is not uncommon to see computer software contract stipulating that the vendor will warrant that software and systems delivered will not contain any viruses or malicious code — a knee-jerk reaction to this is for novice management to include virus-scanning software for systems which otherwise are closed. From a computer programming standpoint, having anti-virus software on an electronic voting machine doesn't make sense because the machine shouldn't be accessing the Internet in a way that would leave it open to virus attacks. While there are a lot of ways that viruses can propagate, ultimately the computer still has to download an executable file and run it, which is something that no election machine should do in normal operation. Hence the question is whether the voting machine manufacturer has taken the proper precaution preventing any external access.   Ideally, voting machines (as well as ATMs and other single-purpose appliances) should be embedded systems, incapable of doing the things that might necessitate anti-virus software. However, in practice such devices are more commonly built as application programs running on ordinary Windows PCs (inside of custom-shaped cases), and they download software updates over the internet.  The comic makes an analogy to a teacher who reassures you that he always wears a condom when teaching. While a condom could be considered ""protection"", and therefore a good thing, common sense dictates that teachers should never end up in a situation where wearing a condom in school would be useful; this parallels the idea that while security in the form of anti-virus software on voting machines could also be considered protection and a good thing, it should never be required. The comment is more likely to make people worried about why the condom is there and what purpose it's serving. Similarly, informed people might worry why a voting machine is connecting to the internet.  In panel one, both the facepalm and ""You're doing it wrong"" are Internet memes, used to mock someone who made a foolish mistake.  The title text refers to 153: Cryptography.","Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold) has blamed Ohio voting machine errors on problems with the machines' McAfee antivirus software.  [Cueball is sitting at a computer, facepalming.] Cueball: Wait. ""Antivirus software""? On voting machines? You're doing it wrong.  [Cueball's friend enters the frame and speaks to Cueball.] Friend: Why? Security is good, right? Cueball: Of course. But, well—  Cueball: Imagine you're at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching.  Friend: Ah. Strictly speaking, it's better than the alternative— Cueball: —Yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong."
504: Legal Hacks,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/504:_Legal_Hacks,programming,It's totally a reasonable modern analogue. Jefferson would have been all about crypto.,"Megan notices that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is blocking access to some webpages. Cueball is thankful that cryptography offers a way around such censorship.   Encryption, sometimes called ""cryptography,"" or ""crypto"" for short, is the art of transmitting messages that can only be read by the intended receiver(s) by using mathematical techniques to conceal (""encrypt"") the data in the message. One common and effective way to encrypt messages is the RSA algorithm, which is based on the difficulty of integer factorization for products of two prime numbers.  Being able to share unbreakable codes and decrypt other people's codes gives countries a military advantage - for example, in World War II, the Americans and British were often able to figure out where a German attack would be coming and send reinforcements there, because they had cracked the German codes. Because of this, the United States government initially tried to keep the mathematical details of strong encryption algorithms (including RSA) inside the country by classifying the algorithms as a weapon. It is a crime to share certain kinds of weapons technology with other countries without permission. Amateur and professional cryptographers, angry about the attempt to restrict their work, lobbied the government to change the rule and stop treating cryptography as a weapon, in part so that they could continue to collaborate with colleagues overseas, and in part because they wanted the ability to pass secret messages that the government could not easily decrypt. The export restrictions were gradually loosened and would have mostly been lifted by the year 2000.  In the comic, Megan makes the provocative and counter-intuitive point that perhaps the cryptographic community could have best ensured easy access to the RSA technique by *allowing* the government to treat RSA as a weapon, and then, once everyone is certain that RSA is a weapon, invoking the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, commonly known as the ""right to bear arms"" amendment (that is, the right to own and use weapons). In other words, if RSA were a weapon, it would be granted constitutional protections. This interpretation is likely a reference to the exceptionally strong antipathy towards arms control in the Southern United States (and not a whole lot weaker in most areas of the Northern and Western states).  Any attempts made by the government to restrict distribution or ownership of firearms (even those which are very similar to military-grade weapons) are typically countered very aggressive opposition from pro-gun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association. These political forces have made most gun restrictions politically untenable.  Megan is likely suggesting that classifying RSA as a weapon would gain the crypto community very powerful and unlikely political allies; on the flip side, if the government had already ruled it a weapon that needed to be restricted for national security purposes, it could easily invoke the same clauses that allows it to restrict actual military-grade hardware such as automatic weapons, explosives and chemical or biological weapons). Megan may also be hinting that, in the future, the US government might try to restrict access to encryption algorithms, making it necessary for cryptographers to defend their rights to them.  Cueball is surprised and impressed by this point, and pauses to contemplate Megan's strategy.  The title text claims that this is a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution, because cryptography (a modern weapon) is analogous to muskets and cannons (the weaponry in use in the 1780s, when the Second Amendment was drafted). As evidence for the analogy, the title text points out that Jefferson would have been a big fan of cryptography, which is plausible, because President Thomas Jefferson (the 3rd President of the United States) was an amateur scientist who enjoyed studying a very wide variety of fields (in fact, he invented the Jefferson disk, an encryption device that was quite advanced for its time). The point is somewhat facetious, because it is hard to imagine a modern technique that Jefferson would not ""be totally into."" Also, the mere assertion that an early President would have been a fan of a technique is not very good evidence that the technique would be legally permitted by a particular Amendment.","[Megan sits at her computer, Cueball standing behind her.] Megan: Another ISP's filtering content. Cueball: Thank God for Crypto.  [Cueball stands alone; Megan is presumably off-panel left.] Cueball: It wasn't that long ago that RSA was illegal to export. Classified a munition.  [Megan, sitting in her chair, is looking back towards Cueball, presumably off-panel right.] Megan: You know, I think the crypto community took the wrong side in that fight. We should've lobbied to keep it counted as a weapon. Cueball: Why?  [She is now turned around in the chair looking at Cueball, who is in-panel again.] Megan: Once they get complacent, we break out the second amendment. [Cueball has his hand on his chin, contemplatively.] Cueball: ...Damn."
538: Security,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/538:_Security,programming,"Actual actual reality: nobody cares about his secrets. (Also, I would be hard-pressed to find that wrench for $5.)","The ""crypto nerd"" would be concerned with strongly encrypting data on their personal machine. This would conceivably come in handy when ""villains"" attempt to steal information on his computer. The crypto nerd imagines that due to his advanced encryption, the crackers will be ultimately defeated. Randall suggests that in the real world, people with the desire to access this information would simply use torture to coerce the nerd to give them the password. Both panels also reference the amount of money used to access the data. In the first the villain is willing to use millions of dollars to construct a super computer, while in the second, he simply uses a $5 wrench. The comic effectively states, completely accurately, that the weakest part of computer security is not the computer, but the user.  RSA is a commonly used, public key encryption method. Current standards typically use 1024, 2048, and (more recently) 4096 bit keys. These encryption methods are not yet (feasibly) breakable. A 4096-bit key will remain unbreakable for the foreseeable future.  The title text pokes fun at typical users, who do not have data that would be worth anything to anyone but themselves. Therefore, it is unlikely that the above situation would ever occur. Additionally, the wrench used in the second panel is large, and presumably more than the $5 referenced by the thug.","A Crypto nerd's imagination: [Cueball is holding a laptop, and his friend is examining it.] Cueball: His laptop's encrypted.

593: Voynich Manuscript,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/593:_Voynich_Manuscript,programming,"Wait, is that the ORIGINAL voynich manuscript? Where did you GET that? Wanna try playing a round of Druids and Dicotyledons?","The Voynich manuscript is a very detailed book written in an unknown script, describing plants and recipes, most of which lack a real-world analogue. Over the past few decades, linguists and cryptographers have unsuccessfully attempted to decode the book. A cut out from the book is depicted in the first frame (real or similar).  Tabletop role-playing games (such as Dungeons and Dragons) are fantasy games with extremely detailed descriptions of fantastical worlds. The invented language is probably a reference to The Lord of the Rings in which author J. R. R. Tolkien invented several languages of which Sindarin (Grey elvish), and Quenya (High elvish), are the most famous.  After being shown the manuscript for the first time by Megan, Cueball argues that it should be obvious that it's just an ancient role-playing-game rulebook, since the human tendency to invent fantastical worlds must have also existed in the past. That it is this obvious was again stated when the manuscript was referenced in 1501: Mysteries.  In the last panel the book is used, 500 years ago, to play a game  similar to Dungeons and Dragons. They speak in a somewhat outdated English. The reference to the real plant Wolfsbane could also be a reference to another invented world, as it is memorably mentioned in the first book of the Harry Potter series.  After concluding this, a shocked Cueball then asks in the title text how Megan got her hands on the original manuscript (which is in the Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library). He then unexpectedly goes on to suggest the prosaic activity of playing Druids and Dicotyledons, assuming such a game could be defined by the manuscript.","[Weird root vegetables surround a strange script.]  [Megan holding up book to Cueball.] Megan: This is the Voynich manuscript— a book, allegedly 500 years old, written in an unrecognized script. It's some kind of visual encyclopedia of imaginary plants and undeciphered ""recipes"".  [Megan points while Cueball opens the book.] Megan: It could be a hoax, a lost language, a cipher, an alien text, glossolatia — no one knows. Cueball: No one? But it's obvious.  [Megan continues to talk. Cueball holds the now closed book.] Megan: ... Obvious? Linguists and cryptographers have been stumped for decades. Cueball: They forget. Human nature doesn't change.  [Close up of Megan and Cueball - the book is off panel.] Cueball: Just imagine someone found a book from our time, full of lists, illustrations, tables, and long, dry descriptions of nonexistent worlds written in an invented language. What have they found? Megan: ...Dear Lord. It is obvious.  [Three people are standing around pawns and a die.

1039: RuBisCO,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1039:_RuBisCO,programming,Bruce Schneier believes safewords are fundamentally insecure and recommends that you ask your partner to stop via public key signature.,"Safe words are designated words for sexual play which are meant to be called if one partner is uncomfortable with the way things are proceeding as alternatives to simply saying ""no"" or ""stop"", which may be used to express playacted reluctance by a submissive partner who actually wants to continue. Calling the pre-chosen ""safe word"" would be a sign to stop. To prevent accidental usage, people generally pick words that they wouldn't normally use. In the case of this comic, the characters are chemists, and the uncommon word they happen to have chosen is Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, also known as RuBisCO (which actually isn't a very uncommon word in the scientific world, as it's the most abundant protein on earth, but it would be uncommon to use the full word). However, the length of the word makes it impractical for a safe word, as it would take too long to say; indeed, using the shorter form ""RuBisCO"" would normally be a fine safe word.  The title text mentions Bruce Schneier, a computer security professional, and public keys which is the publicly known half of public-key cryptography, which uses two mathematically linked keys to decrypt information. The joke is that Schneier considers safewords as a type of security and thus believes they are not safe enough and recommend the key signature. However, whereas it takes a long time to say RuBisCO in full during your submission, it would be impossible to use any public keys to stop your partner.","[Person in background (out-of-frame) screams out this word over all 3 panels.]  Sub: RIBULOSEBISPH..  Sub: ...OSPHATECARBOXYL...  Sub: ...ASEOXYGENASE! Dom: Oh, Sorry! Megan: Man, chemists pick the worst safewords."
1181: PGP,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1181:_PGP,programming,"If you want to be extra safe, check that there's a big block of jumbled characters at the bottom.","PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a program which can be used to encrypt and/or sign data, including messages sent as emails. Encrypting means encoding data in a way that requires a secret key to decrypt and read; signing means that there is a code included in the data which can be used to verify the identify of the sender and that the data has not been altered in transit.  In the case of the email in this comic, it has only been signed; not encrypted (hence, the top of the first line of text can be seen and is legible in normal English). This is more common than encryption, as reading an encrypted message would require the recipient to already be a PGP user. In fact, the use of PGP even to sign email messages is so rare that most people have probably never seen a signed message. Because a signed email is so rare, and because it is already legible and unencrypted, Randall is making the tongue-in-cheek observation that few users, technical or otherwise, actually know how to use the signature to verify the authenticity of the sender using the PGP signature, and that such users can safely assume that since there is a signature, that is good enough evidence that the message is authentic. Further, because PGP signatures are so rare and probably ignored by most recipients, he suggests one would not expect anyone to even bother creating a false PGP signature; therefore the mere existence of a PGP header would suggest authenticity.  The title text extends the joke by suggesting you confirm there's a bunch of random characters in the footer (this is the actual signature that PGP generates which can be used to verify the authenticity of the email). Again, Randall is humorously suggesting that the existence of the block is itself sure evidence of authenticity.","How to use PGP to verify that an email is authentic: Look for this text at the top [In mail header, light grey.] Reply [Highlighted, with arrow pointing to it from the text ""Look for this text at the top"" above.] -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- [In mail message, light grey.] HASH: SHA256 Hey, First of all, thanks for taking care of  [After mail message.] If it's there, the email is probably fine"
1269: Privacy Opinions,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1269:_Privacy_Opinions,programming,I'm the Philosopher until someone hands me a burrito.,"According to the title, the comic is about opinions on internet privacy in general. Six positions are offered as options. Four of the positions are tagged negatively by the author by their subtitles alone: the Crypto Nut, the Conspiracist, the Nihilist, and the Exhibitionist, all of which have negative valences in contemporary English. That the viewer is encouraged to identify negatively with these four positions is further encouraged by the content of the panels, as those characters are depicted either as having such boring lives that they have no need for privacy (the Crypto Nut, the Nihilist), or as being crazy (the Conspiracist, the Exhibitionist).  A fifth position, the Philosopher, is tagged somewhat ambivalently by the author: Megan, or possibly a look-alike, is depicted as boring her interlocutor, yet in the title text, the author admits that he is usually the Philosopher. Also, ""Philosopher"" in vernacular English is neutrally valenced, potentially having the ability to expound either wisdom (sophia) or sophistry. It is also a synonym for Sage, the sixth position. As the author condones his own movement from Philosopher to Sage, he thus indicates that the Philosopher is to be viewed negatively, even if it is a tempting position to hold.  The title of the sixth position, the ""Sage"", is positively valenced in contemporary English, and the author in the title text states that once he obtains a ""burrito"" – i.e., a ""real"" thing, he switches from the Philosopher to the Sage. The internal evidence presented thus far therefore is entirely consistent; the author encourages the reader to identify with the Sage. However, the choice of Beret Guy to represent the Sage undercuts this somewhat as Beret Guy is frequently seen as bizarrely disconnected from reality in a way that is maladaptive (e.g. 1030: Keyed) and overly obsessed with food to the point of creating trouble and potential self-harm (e.g. 452: Mission).  By presenting five negatively tagged positions followed by a positively tagged sixth and final one, the author follows a rhetorical commonplace of listing and refuting a number of positions one by one, concluding with the favored and best one, which is not refuted and should be accepted both on its own merits and by virtue of being the last one standing. The comic therefore implies that no other (significant) positions exist.  Having completed the rhetorical analysis of the comic, we are now in a position to understand the meaning of ""Internet Privacy"".  Panels #3 and 5 directly reference the American NSA. Panel #5's ""exhibitionist"" also references Google, but the characters in the panel appear to be NSA agents (one wears an official cap and they are viewing the exhibitionist on an official, government-looking monitor). Likewise, the focus of the ""Nihilist"" is that the joke is on the people who gather the data, rather than those who are subsequently able to make use of it (such as Facebook's users rather than ""Facebook"" itself; i.e., Facebook's employees and, by extension, its advertisers). The content of the actual data is only mentioned in panels #2, 4, and 5, and in each panel, it is suggested that it is meaningless or trivial. The Sage underscores the notion that any data known about him does not bother him, and therefore must be meaningless or trivial. The reader is thus encouraged to believe that it does not actually matter whether others discover personal data about him/her.  The comic is therefore what social theorists call reductive, because it reduces the range of possibilities of ""Opinions on Internet Privacy"" to an artificially and simplistically narrow subset; in this case, individuals concerned with government or corporate agencies using data that they have gathered on individuals, and the futility of worrying about such things. The comic does not admit the possibility of other ""opinions on internet privacy"" – namely, that individuals might have legitimate concerns with governmental or corporate uses of their data, let alone other individuals' access to data that is assembled and distributed by corporations such as Facebook. The comic likewise does not consider the possibility of individuals having more interesting lives than the characters depicted, and therefore very real concerns about their privacy due to the activities that they engage in that are potentially more career limiting (should they be discovered) than obsessing about cryptography or eating a burrito.  The comic is ""functionally"" reductive, as opposed to ""intentionally"" reductive, because the reduction is the function or effect of the comic for readers who read it straightforwardly. There is not enough internal evidence in the comic to maintain that the author intentionally excluded other viable opinions on internet privacy; it could be that they are just not on his radar. For example, we do not have enough information in the comic to claim that the author is against civil rights; it could be simply that he doesn't often think about them. Likewise, it would exceed the evidence of the comic to claim that the author believes that schoolteachers who use the internet to facilitate legal but frowned-upon sexual behaviors should lose their jobs if they are found out due to internet privacy breaches; it could be that the author simply hasn't bothered to worry about these matters if they don't affect him personally. This adjudication – whether the comic is ""intentionally"" reductive or not – may only be made on the basis of external evidence; that is, data known about the author from sources beyond this comic.  An alternative interpretation of the title text is that it is not Randall speaking his own opinion, but instead represents Beret Guy's (i.e. the ""Sage's"") perspective. Randall may indeed have some concern with internet privacy, which would be consistent with the views on open-source security expressed in 463: Voting Machines, for example. In other cases, such as 1490: Atoms and 1419: On the Phone, the title text has been used as additional, farcical statements made by characters in the strip, rather than as Randall expressing his own views. Under this interpretation, Beret Guy would be prone to philosophizing about security, but then be easily distracted by a burrito; this is consistent with Beret Guy's general behavior.  Additional observations about the comic follow.  The release of the comic on this date could be to coincide with the premiere of South Park's 17th season on the same date, which starts with an episode (Let Go, Let Gov) in which Cartman discovers that the NSA has been spying on him.  The title text is to suggest that he enjoys burritos so much that being handed one even while philosophizing (his natural state) would stop him in his tracks to eat the burrito, thus becoming a pseudo-sage concerned only with the burrito at the exclusion of the topic of internet security. The burrito is later mentioned as a way to stay connected to the real word (compared to the world of art) in 1496: Art Project.","Opinions on Internet Privacy The Philosopher: Megan: ""Privacy"" is an impractical way to think about data in a digital world so unlike the one in which our soci-- Ponytail:  So bored.

1286: Encryptic,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1286:_Encryptic,programming,It was bound to happen eventually. This data theft will enable almost limitless [xkcd.com/792]-style password reuse attacks in the coming weeks. There's only one group that comes out of this looking smart: Everyone who pirated Photoshop.,"Web sites and other computers that authenticate users via passwords need to be able to know if the user typed in the right password. But storing the password itself on the computer has been known to be unnecessarily risky since the publication of Password Security: A Case History in 1978. In that paper, Robert Morris and Ken Thompson demonstrated the practice of using a slow, cryptographically-secure one-way hash function, so that even if the password file is stolen, it will be very hard to figure out what the passwords are, so long as the passwords themselves are suitably complex. They also pioneered the use of a ""salt"" which makes each password hash completely different even if two users use the same password. See A tour of password questions and answers for background on salts and suitably slow hash functions.  Adobe, however, ignored these well-known principles, and instead stored over a hundred million passwords in a reversibly encrypted way, using a terrible choice of encryption methods which exposes a great deal of information about the passwords, and does not involve a salt. This password database was recently obtained by someone and released on the Internet.  In particular, Adobe used Triple DES, an older encryption algorithm which can still be relatively secure when properly used, but they used it improperly. It works on 64-bit (8 character) blocks. Assuming that the passwords are stored in plain ASCII, this means that a sequence of 8 characters in a password which starts on a character position which is a multiple of eight is always encrypted to the same result. Therefore, two passwords starting with ""12345678"" would start with the same block after being encrypted. Furthermore, this means that you can actually get a very good idea of the length of the password since anything with only one block is a password with length between 1 and 8 characters, and having two blocks implies it has between 9 and 16 characters, etc.  Adobe also stored hints users created for their passwords. That means that an attacker knows not only if the same 8 characters are used for multiple passwords but also has some hints for guessing them. That means that common password portions should be easy to recover and that any user may be ""compromised"" by someone else using a part of the same password and providing a good hint. As an example, a password having three hints ""Big Apple"", ""Twin Towers"" and ""If you can make it there"" is probably ""New York"" or a simple variation on that. The weakness here is that no decryption and therefore no hard cracking has to take place, you just group the passwords by their encrypted blocks and try to solve them like a crossword puzzle. These weaknesses have already been used to presumably identify a password used by Edward Snowden, as discussed at 7 Habits of Highly Effective Hackers: Can someone be targeted using the Adobe breach?.  The examples are not taken from the actual leaked file, since that uses a different format, and the examples are evidently cleverly crafted to make a nice crossword-like puzzle, which can be solved as shown in the Passwords section below.  As mentioned on http://filosottile.github.io/analyzing-the-adobe-leaked-passwords/ the data in the comic isn't real and contains a hidden message. If the ""user password"" hashes are Base64 encoded, they read:  More readable:  E.g., with the initial unique hash blocks: python -c ""print '4e18acc1ab27a2d6a0a2876eb1ea1fca'.decode('hex_codec').encode('base64')""  The last letter ""r"" is not fully encoded in the data shown, but any letter from ""g"" to ""v"" produces the same binary data.  The title text makes a reference to a previous comic: Black Hat's trouble with what to do with stolen passwords. It also states that users of pirated Photoshop are the winners here. This is because in order to make Photoshop pirate-able, it was modified (cracked) by removing the requirement for registration so their passwords were not sent to Adobe and therefore are not present in the leaked file.  Soon after this comic was published, the most common 1000 passwords were actually compiled into a set of 10 interactive online crosswords, inspired by the comic.  The title itself is a reference to cryptic crosswords.  Note that characters in the passwords could be upper or lower case, and they may involve common substitutions like ""0"" (number zero) for ""O"" (letter O); therefore, the clues cannot guarantee that the answer shown here is precisely correct. Nevertheless, we have plenty of information for a brute force attack.","Hackers recently leaked 153 million Adobe user emails, encrypted passwords, and password hints. Adobe encrypted the passwords improperly, misusing block-mode 3DES. The result is something wonderful:  The greatest crossword puzzle in the history of the world"
1323: Protocol,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1323:_Protocol,programming,"Changing the names would be easier, but if you're not comfortable lying, try only making friends with people named Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.","Alice, Bob, and Eve are role names traditionally used in describing cryptographic protocols. Rather than talking about ""Person A"", ""Person B"", ""Person C"", names beginning with each letter are used instead, and giving them different genders let pronouns be used to shorten discussions. For example: ""Person A sends Person B a message encoded with Person B's public key"" is much easier to parse when written as ""Alice sends Bob a message encoded with his public key."" Eve is short for ""eavesdropper"" - a person trying to find out what's being said in the conversations between the other people. The classic situation involves Alice wanting to send a secret message to Bob, while Eve (the eavesdropper), attempts to read the message, ideally without Alice or Bob ever finding out. Additional participants such as Carol (Person C) can be added if necessary. The list of names has become very standardised over time as described at Alice and Bob.  The joke here is that any computer scientist, hearing the names used, will think that they are listening to a cryptography problem. By changing the names in a story to these role names, you can induce them to listen carefully to boring stories. The fewer the interesting details, the more it sounds like a general problem, so very boring stories are actually the easiest.  The title text shows a more radical approach to the problem, for people who do not feel comfortable about lying. In this approach, you only make friends with people who have the appropriate names already.  The comic title also can be interpreted in two ways. First, the computer scientist thinks the conversation is about an encryption protocol. Second, the way the conversation is carried resembles a protocol used by many data communication systems, where one side sends data while the other sends back an acknowledgement upon receiving the data. In this case, the data are the lines of the boring story.  In comic 177: Alice and Bob these names are used in the same context. Instead of Alice and Bob being perfectly innocent people who just want to communicate in private, Bob is actually having an affair with Alice. Eve —his former partner— cracked the encryption to see what the message contained. Thus, this comic seems to continue the Alice/Bob romance, jealous-Eve plot, with Eve apparently confronting Alice over her text message to Bob.","[Cueball is telling a story to a Computer Scientist who is seated at his desk.] Cueball: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere. Computer Scientist: Uh huh. Cueball: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place. Computer Scientist: With you so far. Cueball: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet. Computer Scientist: Yeah? CAPTION: I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story."
1553: Public Key,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1553:_Public_Key,programming,"I guess I should be signing stuff, but I've never been sure what to sign. Maybe if I post my private key, I can crowdsource my decisions about what to sign.","In Public-key cryptography, two keys are generated for a user. The public key can be used to encrypt messages, but not decrypt them. The private key is necessary for decryption, and as its name implies, is meant to be used solely by the user.  Since the public key is initially designated to be shared, anyone who has that key can send the user an encrypted message that only he or she can decrypt. Cueball has been following this rule, but he notices that it appears nobody has ever used his public key for anything. He contemplates sharing his private key, which he believes would generate more interest in him personally. However, he appears to overlook the fact that doing so would allow anyone to decrypt messages sent to him, thus defeating the entire purpose of encryption.  The title text refers to another feature of Public-key cryptography: In addition to assuring that certain messages can only be read by a specific key owner, it can also assure that certain messages could only have been written by a specific key owner, by ""signing"" it using the private key. Anyone can read a signed message, but readers with the public key can then verify that the owner of the private key wrote (or at least signed) the message, rather than someone pretending to be the owner. If Cueball published his private key, then anybody could sign any message as him, effectively impersonating him and also defeating the purpose of encryption.  Crowdsourcing is the term used for delegating work or tasks to a largely volunteered and uncontrolled set of people on the Internet.  It is similar in concept to outsourcing, in which work is delegated to an external source of labor, typically a company in a foreign country. Famous instances of crowdsourcing include reCAPTCHA (in which users both verify they are human and help digitize words and phrases in books that digitization software cannot understand) and a farm in the UK in which ordinary Internet users make decisions about how the farm is run.  In Cueball's case, delegating decisions about his contracts and spending to the Internet is not likely to be a wise choice.  When Cueball first created the key pair, he imagined it would be something he used from time to time, for reading messages only intended for him or for sending ""signed"" messages.  Since nothing of the sort happened, he imagines releasing both keys might cause some activity, and at this point he is happier with a ""bad"" outcome than with a boring one.  Randall previously ironically mentioned a public key in 370: Redwall.","[In the first panel, Cueball is sitting in a chair and is using a laptop.] Cueball (thinking): I've been posting my public key for 15 years now, but no one has ever asked me for it or used it for anything as far as I can tell.

1808: Hacking,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1808:_Hacking,programming,"The dump also contains a list of millions of prime factors, a 0-day Tamagotchi exploit, and a technique for getting gcc and bash to execute arbitrary code.","This comic is referencing an incident on the day before this comic was released, March 7, 2017, in which WikiLeaks exposed thousands of hacking exploits (thus the title) and programs from the CIA (see for instance this article: WikiLeaks Just Dumped a Mega-Trove of CIA Hacking Secrets). Many of the tools that were in the leak were similar to publicly available tools, or not entirely unexpected, with several coming from sites such as StackOverflow and Reddit.  The main joke in this comic refers to the common practice of adding spaces between parts of an email address when publishing them on websites.  For example, ""[email protected]"" may be written as ""john dot doe at example dot org"".  The purported goal of doing this is to thwart page scraping bots from harvesting the correct email addresses and prevent them from becoming the target of spam or being sold as address lists for email marketers.    In this comic, Ponytail tells Cueball that the CIA has a tool which can delete such spaces. Such a tool can fix the space and most likely convert the words ""dot"" and ""at"" into their respective symbols. This will overcome the problems faced by harvesting tools, and make these email addresses more prone to receive spam.   Cueball appears shocked to hear this news, but given the caption below, stating that this was one of the less dramatic revelations from the CIA hacking dump, this is likely sarcasm by Cueball (and Randall). In fact, it is quite simple to devise a program which detects and converts/removes such spaces; it's naive to believe that one can prevent e-mail addresses from being harvested just by writing the addresses with space or omitting @ etc. Some people might not realize that he's being sarcastic, though, and that misunderstanding might be part of the joke.  The title text lists three other undramatic (fictitious) hacking exploits which sound more interesting, but are still more or less useless, and certainly not dramatic news. They are:",[Ponytail is writing on her laptop at her desk while Cueball looks over her shoulder.] Ponytail: You know how sometimes people put a space in their email address to make it harder to harvest?

Manually trying to look for a specific pattern through 200 MB of text is equivalent to looking for a needle in a haystack. But this task can be made easy by using regexes, since a script can read through text and match specific string patterns much faster than humans can achieve.

1031: s/keyboard/leopard/,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1031:_s/keyboard/leopard/,programming,Problem Exists Between Leopard And Chair,"Randall's browser looks like Google Chrome and he has installed at least four extensions on it, which explains the little symbols to the right of the address bar. Extensions are small programs that install into your Internet browser and change the Web pages as you view them. Some make pages easier to read, some remove ads (the third extension is AdBlock) and so on.   For the joke in this comic, an extension accidentally replaces the word ""keyboard"" with ""leopard"" in a regex (or regular expression). In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means to ""match"" (specify and recognize) patterns in text, such as particular characters or words. The command to substitute/replace a string is ""s"", e.g. ""s/old/new/"" replaces any occurrence of ""old"" with ""new"". The title therefore contains the command to change ""keyboard"" into ""leopard"".  It's not clear what the extension Randall installed was actually supposed to do, but most extensions that revolve around text replacement are humorous in nature (such as Cloud to Butt, which replaces all instances of ""the cloud"" with ""my butt"").  The title text references the common IT phrase ""Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair"" or PEBKAC, which means that the problem is caused by the user, not by any failure of the computer.

1171: Perl Problems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1171:_Perl_Problems,programming,"To generate #1 albums, 'jay --help' recommends the -z flag.","Perl is a scripting language that makes heavy use of regular expressions, which are good for dealing with large amounts of text quickly. In the comic, the man wearing sunglasses parodies the song ""99 Problems"" in which the rapper Jay-Z says:  In the comic however, the rapper tries to solve his problems with Perl's regular expressions, and ends up only creating another problem for himself, which is a reference to a famous quote by Jamie Zawinski (whose name could also be shortened to ""Jay-Z""): ""Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems."" (This quote was revisited in 1313: Regex Golf.)  ""program --help"" is a common way, originating with the GNU project, to ask a program to show documentation on its usage and supported parameters; which, for some program, could include a ""-z"" command-line argument (""flag""), so the command would read ""jay -z"". In this case, it is just an obvious play on the rapper's name. jay is also an actual C program that is a compiler-compiler for java, but it doesn't have a ""-z"" flag.

Given a regular expression, one can search for the pattern it specifies inside a text string. If the pattern is found, it's said that the pattern ""matches"" the string; if it's not found, it's said it doesn't match.  The title of the comic and the first panel is based on ""regex golf"", which is a discipline of ""code golf"", a game in which programmers attempt to solve a given programming problem using as few characters as possible, analogous to the number of golf shots it takes to reach the goal. In regex golfing, the programmer is given two sets of text fragments, and he or she tries to write the shortest possible regular expression which would match all elements of one set, while at the same time not matching any element from the other set.  The regex golf challenge Megan faces consists of matching all subtitles of (then extant) Star Wars films, while not matching any subtitle of Star Trek movies. Subtitles are the secondary titles of the movies, after the ""Star Trek: "" or ""Star Wars Episode N: "". For example, in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the subtitle is The Phantom Menace. In the first panel, she created a 12-character regex solving the challenge.  Then she moved on to building a tool which would automatically build such a regex for arbitrary lists of text, which could be described as meta- regex golfing. But as she has lost this tool, she needs to search through her files and chooses a tool called ""grep"" to find it. This implies that she needs a regular expression that would find any code that appears to be a regex golf generator, which leads to another ""meta-"" layer of abstraction. At the end, Megan notes this sequence of meta-meta-... might go to infinity and Cueball quips that she now has ""infinite problems"" as a result of her efforts; Megan retorts that she already had ""infinite problems"" because she's geeky enough to run meta-versions of programs on themselves, and stubborn enough to continue on until she fails, to the exclusion of all else. This also seems to be a reference to a famous quote (see also 1171: Perl Problems):  The first regex Megan uses is /m | [tn]|b/, said to match Star Wars subtitles but not Star Trek.  The forward slashes / just mark the start and end of the regex. The | character means ""or"", so the regex matches any string that contains the patterns ""m "", "" [tn]"" or ""b"" (including the spaces). The square brackets match one of the enclosed characters, meaning that "" [tn]"" matches either "" t"" or "" n"". The regex is apparently case-insensitive, because it wouldn't work otherwise.  The Star Wars subtitles match the parts of the regex in the following way:  Note that if one included the animated film ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" it would not be matched by "" [tn]"" because the T is the start of the subtitle and is not preceded by a space. (The string also will likely fail to match some or all of the upcoming post-Disney-acquisition Star Wars films, which the comic predates; it definitely does not match the first two such films, 2015's ""The Force Awakens"" and 2017's ""The Last Jedi"")  On the other hand, none of the Star Trek subtitles contains an M followed by a space, a T or an N preceded by a space, or any B, so the regex does not match any of them. Note that in the original series all subtitles start with a ""T"" but it's the first character so it's not preceded by a space.  Here is the list that Megan probably used:  Note that Star Trek: Beyond was released after this comic and matches the regex, so the pattern doesn't work any more.  In the last panel ""and beyond"" Megan uses the regular expression /(meta-)*regex golf/ to describe her problem. * means ""zero or more"" of the preceding character/group (parentheses () group characters). So this regex matches ""regex golf"", ""meta-regex golf"", ""meta-meta-regex golf"", etc. In a way this is regex golf in itself, matching all levels of meta-regex golf while not matching anything else.  In the title text, there is a long regex that is the solution of another regex golf challenge: matching the last names of all elected US presidents but not their opponents. Note that the list of opponents include some people who were previously or later became presidents, or whose last name matches that of another person who was president, so taken literally this is impossible. To make this work the list of opponents must exclude any names of presidents. The regular expression itself works in a very similar way to the Star Wars/Trek one, including several different patterns separated by |. Each elected president matches one pattern while each opponent matches none.  Here is a list of elected president and the patterns they match:  Some presidents are missing because they weren't elected but became presidents after the resignation/death of their formers.  And here is a list of how many unique last names are matched by each expression:  Randall's regular expression must be modified slightly, because it also matches John C. Fremont, the runner-up to James Buchanan in 1856, as discussed by Peter Norvig at xkcd 1313: Regex Golf.  Note that Norvig provides a small amount of Python code which actually plays regex golf with arbitrary lists, and found a shorter solution than Randall's for the Star Wars vs Star Trek game.  The regex does not match Donald Trump, who won over Hillary Clinton in 2016, and thus would need to be updated. The regex does match Hillary Clinton's last name, but because a person with the same last name (Bill Clinton) was president, this does not count as a mistake. There was already a losing opponent called George Clinton who ran in 1792 and 1812.","Regex golf: [Megan is sitting at a laptop.

224: Lisp,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/224:_Lisp,regex,We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.,"Lisp is a computer programming language with simple, highly regular syntax. The language's most notable feature is that programs take the same form as the language's primary data structure (the linked list). This blurs the line between code and data and permits programs to inspect and even alter their own source code, thereby opening up deep opportunities for metaprogramming. Lisp is also a functional programming language (though not purely functional, as some more recent languages are), meaning that programs are expressed in terms that are simple elaborations or extensions of the lambda calculus, a formal mathematical model of computation. This gives programs written in functional languages such as Lisp a distinctively abstract, mathematical form that is commonly considered difficult to fully grok (see 1270: Functional).  The phrase A suffusion of blue is a reference to Douglas Adams' book The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul. In it, an I Ching calculator calculates that everything above the value of 4 is a suffusion of yellow.  In the comic, Cueball marvels at the fundamental and complete nature of the language of creation that he sees in his dream. In the Lisp programming language, ""car"" is a primitive (i.e. basic) function that produces the first item in a list. The line ""My God, It's full of 'car's"" is a pun, most likely referring to the movie 2010: The Year We Make Contact, the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. In the book 2001: A Space Odyssey, when astronaut David Bowman accidentally activates a star gate, he exclaims as he enters it ""The thing's hollow — it goes on forever — and — oh my God - it's full of stars!"", although he does not say anything in the first movie during the final sequence.  In the second panel, Cueball remarks that, ""At once, just like they said, I felt a great enlightenment."" This is a reference to a pattern of observations among programmers and computer scientists that while Lisp often seems alien or arcane — even deliberately so, even to experienced hackers, even with repeated exposure over time — truly understanding Lisp in a deep, non-superficial way, results in a profound epiphany, a sudden and abiding illumination wherein one's preconceived notions about computation and programming are fundamentally transfigured, oftentimes over the course of a very short span such as during a single all-day hacking binge. Lispers commonly describe the experience as being akin to learning programming for the first time again; Daniel P. Friedman (author of much ground-breaking research and many popular introductory texts on Lisp and programming language design) described it as ""[learning] to think recursively,"" and contended that ""thinking about [functional] computing is one of the most exciting things the human mind can do.""  Cueball's remarks about patterns, metapatterns, and the disappearance of syntax are reactions to the elegant simplicity of the Lisp programming language, in which it is relatively easy to build immensely sophisticated programs using simple recursive elaborations of structure. This is fundamentally unlike the much more typical and common imperative programming languages, in which programs are written as chains of instructions for the machine to follow.  God replies that the universe was actually hacked together with the programming language Perl. Perl employs an idiosyncratic syntax that borrows liberally from a number of other languages. Although a versatile language often employed for assembling projects quickly (the much-loved Programming Perl introduces it as ""[the] language for getting your job done""), Perl has a reputation for being ugly and inelegant, partly as a result of its pidgin-like fusion of many inconsistent language elements and code styles. It was famously described as a ""Swiss-Army chainsaw,"" because it is very powerful but also unwieldy and unattractive. By way of contrast to Daniel Friedman above, Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, criticized the highly cerebral Lisp attitude toward programming with the words  The joke is that the Creator, like many software developers, was a bit rushed and chose to quickly throw together a working prototype rather than do the job right from the beginning; concurrently, that Cueball, thinking he has discovered an amazing and beautiful secret in the hidden world of Lisp, learns that in fact the real world is filled with ugly hacks and quick-and-dirty imperative code.  A (possible) hidden joke might be an oblique reference to Greenspun's tenth rule when God replies with ""I mean, ostensibly, yes."" Greenspun's tenth rule says that any sufficiently complex program written in another high level programming language will necessarily contain an imperfect, undocumented, slow, and bug-ridden implementation of about half of Common Lisp. Greenspun's tenth rule was meant to express the belief that Common Lisp, a large, full-featured Lisp dialect, is so flexible and robust that any attempt to render any really sophisticated program in most other languages requires the programmer to expend extraordinary effort unwittingly reinventing, in needlessly convoluted fashion, features and systems that would be elegant and trivial in Common Lisp. This explains why such a program might look or feel ""Lispy"" to an unfamiliar observer, and why the universe (if viewed as such a program) might look to mathematicians and scientists as though it probably has a beautifully simple mathematical basis, even if in reality it was just hacked together with a bunch of ersatz, special-case rules.  The title text continues the analogy by suggesting that the theory of quantum mechanics was written in regular expressions (""regexes""), a complex language for pattern matching used heavily in Perl. Regular expressions are often criticized as being a write-only language, that is, a language so complicated in syntax that any significant program written in them cannot be understood by anybody (often not even the original author). Documentation is essential to assist in the understanding of complex regular expressions. The title text claims that at some point, the documentation for quantum mechanics was lost, which explains why quantum mechanics is so bizarre and counterintuitive.","[Floating in space.] Speaker: Last night I drifted off while reading a Lisp book.

1031: s/keyboard/leopard/,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1031:_s/keyboard/leopard/,regex,Problem Exists Between Leopard And Chair,"Randall's browser looks like Google Chrome and he has installed at least four extensions on it, which explains the little symbols to the right of the address bar. Extensions are small programs that install into your Internet browser and change the Web pages as you view them. Some make pages easier to read, some remove ads (the third extension is AdBlock) and so on.   For the joke in this comic, an extension accidentally replaces the word ""keyboard"" with ""leopard"" in a regex (or regular expression). In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means to ""match"" (specify and recognize) patterns in text, such as particular characters or words. The command to substitute/replace a string is ""s"", e.g. ""s/old/new/"" replaces any occurrence of ""old"" with ""new"". The title therefore contains the command to change ""keyboard"" into ""leopard"".  It's not clear what the extension Randall installed was actually supposed to do, but most extensions that revolve around text replacement are humorous in nature (such as Cloud to Butt, which replaces all instances of ""the cloud"" with ""my butt"").  The title text references the common IT phrase ""Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair"" or PEBKAC, which means that the problem is caused by the user, not by any failure of the computer.  There has been several comics using substitutions, both before and after this one.","[There are two browser windows open on a computer screen.] [The first browser window, taking up most of the screen, but partly blocked by the other window at the bottom, has a Wikipedia article open.

1171: Perl Problems,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1171:_Perl_Problems,regex,"To generate #1 albums, 'jay --help' recommends the -z flag.","Perl is a scripting language that makes heavy use of regular expressions, which are good for dealing with large amounts of text quickly. In the comic, the man wearing sunglasses parodies the song ""99 Problems"" in which the rapper Jay-Z says:  In the comic however, the rapper tries to solve his problems with Perl's regular expressions, and ends up only creating another problem for himself, which is a reference to a famous quote by Jamie Zawinski (whose name could also be shortened to ""Jay-Z""): ""Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems."" (This quote was revisited in 1313: Regex Golf.)  ""program --help"" is a common way, originating with the GNU project, to ask a program to show documentation on its usage and supported parameters; which, for some program, could include a ""-z"" command-line argument (""flag""), so the command would read ""jay -z"". In this case, it is just an obvious play on the rapper's name. jay is also an actual C program that is a compiler-compiler for java, but it doesn't have a ""-z"" flag.  This sort of problematically recursive self-reference is reminiscent of comic 927: Standards, and 1739: Fixing Problems.","[Man with sunglasses talking (or, alternatively, rapping) to Cueball.] Sunglasses: If you're havin' perl problems I feel bad for you, son-  Sunglasses: I got 99 problems,  Sunglasses: So I used regular expressions.

1277: Ayn Random,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1277:_Ayn_Random,regex,"In a cavern deep below the Earth, Ayn Rand, Paul Ryan, Rand Paul, Ann Druyan, Paul Rudd, Alan Alda, and Duran Duran meet together in the Secret Council of /(\b[plurandy]+\b ?){2}/i.","The comic is an attack on the problems with the philosophy of ""Objectivism"". White Hat explains to Cueball a program he wrote, the ""Ayn Random Number Generator"", which is a pun on Ayn Rand, the name of a writer who created a philosophical system known as Objectivism. The joke is an attack on her philosophy, which claims to be a completely fair mechanism for distributing resources, but inherently favors those who start out with more resources, or already in a position to acquire the resources. It also has a strong overarching theme that people that believe in objectivism are inherently better than other people, and thus deserve what extra resources can be acquired - as with the Ayn Random Number Generator, which claims to be completely fair and balanced, but actually favors some numbers - which White Hat explains by saying that they deserve to come up more because they're inherently better.  Now, objectivists, of course, would challenge the above portrayal, but the joke is, in the end, an attack on Ayn Rand's philosophies. A more nuanced description is that objectivists believe that the primary aim of life is to maximise personal happiness. In their view, if some humans are born more capable of satisfying their desires than other people, they deserve to reap greater rewards from life than others, no matter the cost to those others.  As an aside, ""biased"" random number generators exist. They're called weighted random number generators, and they have many practical applications when the programmer isn't lying about the number generator's function and output.  The title text identifies a group of people whose names match the regular expression /(\b[plurandy]+\b ?){2}/i. A step-by-step explanation of the expression:  Overall, it matches two words separated by a space, composed entirely of the letters in [plurandy], which is what all the names listed have in common.  As an aside, if the entirety of the title text is matched against the regular expression, it matches ""and Duran"" instead of ""Duran Duran"".  Since the primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is rationality (or, at least, ""rationality"" as defined by Rand: her critics argue that the conclusions she reached do not actually derive inevitably from her premises and that additional, unstated assumptions are necessary to make the system work), the implication may be that the random number generator favors rational numbers (numbers that can be written as a fraction, i.e. a quotient p/q). On the other hand, given computers cannot store data of unlimited length, it is impossible for any real world computer random number generator to produce an irrational number in any of the usual integer or floating point representations—so probably not.  (Although a computer could encode irrationals or generate them randomly if it uses another representation, one of the standard algebraic number representations, for instance.)  Alternately, an Objectivist might argue that if the intent of the comic is to attack or mock Objectivism, then the comic inadvertently satirizes itself via the ""rationality"" interpretation.","[Cueball sitting at a laptop, White Hat behind him.] Cueball: This Ayn Random number generator you wrote claims to be fair, but the output is biased toward certain numbers.

Given a regular expression, one can search for the pattern it specifies inside a text string. If the pattern is found, it's said that the pattern ""matches"" the string; if it's not found, it's said it doesn't match.  The title of the comic and the first panel is based on ""regex golf"", which is a discipline of ""code golf"", a game in which programmers attempt to solve a given programming problem using as few characters as possible, analogous to the number of golf shots it takes to reach the goal. In regex golfing, the programmer is given two sets of text fragments, and he or she tries to write the shortest possible regular expression which would match all elements of one set, while at the same time not matching any element from the other set.  The regex golf challenge Megan faces consists of matching all subtitles of (then extant) Star Wars films, while not matching any subtitle of Star Trek movies. Subtitles are the secondary titles of the movies, after the ""Star Trek: "" or ""Star Wars Episode N: "". For example, in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the subtitle is The Phantom Menace. In the first panel, she created a 12-character regex solving the challenge.  Then she moved on to building a tool which would automatically build such a regex for arbitrary lists of text, which could be described as meta- regex golfing. But as she has lost this tool, she needs to search through her files and chooses a tool called ""grep"" to find it. This implies that she needs a regular expression that would find any code that appears to be a regex golf generator, which leads to another ""meta-"" layer of abstraction. At the end, Megan notes this sequence of meta-meta-... might go to infinity and Cueball quips that she now has ""infinite problems"" as a result of her efforts; Megan retorts that she already had ""infinite problems"" because she's geeky enough to run meta-versions of programs on themselves, and stubborn enough to continue on until she fails, to the exclusion of all else. This also seems to be a reference to a famous quote (see also 1171: Perl Problems):  The first regex Megan uses is /m | [tn]|b/, said to match Star Wars subtitles but not Star Trek.  The forward slashes / just mark the start and end of the regex. The | character means ""or"", so the regex matches any string that contains the patterns ""m "", "" [tn]"" or ""b"" (including the spaces). The square brackets match one of the enclosed characters, meaning that "" [tn]"" matches either "" t"" or "" n"". The regex is apparently case-insensitive, because it wouldn't work otherwise.  The Star Wars subtitles match the parts of the regex in the following way:  Note that if one included the animated film ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" it would not be matched by "" [tn]"" because the T is the start of the subtitle and is not preceded by a space. (The string also will likely fail to match some or all of the upcoming post-Disney-acquisition Star Wars films, which the comic predates; it definitely does not match the first two such films, 2015's ""The Force Awakens"" and 2017's ""The Last Jedi"")  On the other hand, none of the Star Trek subtitles contains an M followed by a space, a T or an N preceded by a space, or any B, so the regex does not match any of them. Note that in the original series all subtitles start with a ""T"" but it's the first character so it's not preceded by a space.  Here is the list that Megan probably used:  Note that Star Trek: Beyond was released after this comic and matches the regex, so the pattern doesn't work any more.  In the last panel ""and beyond"" Megan uses the regular expression /(meta-)*regex golf/ to describe her problem. * means ""zero or more"" of the preceding character/group (parentheses () group characters). So this regex matches ""regex golf"", ""meta-regex golf"", ""meta-meta-regex golf"", etc. In a way this is regex golf in itself, matching all levels of meta-regex golf while not matching anything else.  In the title text, there is a long regex that is the solution of another regex golf challenge: matching the last names of all elected US presidents but not their opponents. Note that the list of opponents include some people who were previously or later became presidents, or whose last name matches that of another person who was president, so taken literally this is impossible. To make this work the list of opponents must exclude any names of presidents. The regular expression itself works in a very similar way to the Star Wars/Trek one, including several different patterns separated by |. Each elected president matches one pattern while each opponent matches none.  Here is a list of elected president and the patterns they match:  Some presidents are missing because they weren't elected but became presidents after the resignation/death of their formers.  And here is a list of how many unique last names are matched by each expression:  Randall's regular expression must be modified slightly, because it also matches John C. Fremont, the runner-up to James Buchanan in 1856, as discussed by Peter Norvig at xkcd 1313: Regex Golf.  Note that Norvig provides a small amount of Python code which actually plays regex golf with arbitrary lists, and found a shorter solution than Randall's for the Star Wars vs Star Trek game.  The regex does not match Donald Trump, who won over Hillary Clinton in 2016, and thus would need to be updated. The regex does match Hillary Clinton's last name, but because a person with the same last name (Bill Clinton) was president, this does not count as a mistake. There was already a losing opponent called George Clinton who ran in 1792 and 1812.","Regex golf: [Megan is sitting at a laptop.

1638: Backslashes,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1638:_Backslashes,regex,"I searched my .bash_history for the line with the highest ratio of special characters to regular alphanumeric characters, and the winner was: cat out.txt | grep -o ""[[(].*[])][^)]]*$"" ... I have no memory of this and no idea what I was trying to do, but I sure hope it worked.","Most programming languages use the concept of a string literal, which is just a text between some delimiters, usually quotes. For example, ""Hello, world"" is a string literal. The text being represented is Hello, world without the quotes. However, the quotes are also written to mark the beginning and end of the string. This is a problem when the text itself contains a quote, as in ""This is a ""quoted"" string"". The quotes around the word ""quoted"" are intended to be part of the text, but the language processor will likely confuse it for the end of the string, which would thus be two strings with quoted outside these strings (probably resulting in a syntax error).  To avoid this problem, an escape character (usually a backslash) is prepended to non-string-terminating quotes. So, the previous text would be written as ""This is a \""quoted\"" string"". The language processor will substitute every occurrence of \"" with only the quote character, and the string terminates at the quote character which does not immediately follow a backslash. In this case the resulting text string would be This is a ""quoted"" string as intended.  However, the problem now is that the intended text might contain a backslash itself. For example, the text ""C:\"" will now be interpreted as an unterminated string containing a quote character. To avoid this, literal backslashes also are escaped with a second backslash, i.e. instead of ""C:\"" we write ""C:\\"", where the language processor interprets \\ as one single backslash and the quote terminates the string to give C:\ as the output.  This doubling of backslashes happens in most programming and scripting languages, but also in other syntactic constructs such as regular expressions. So, when several of these languages are used in conjunction, backslashes pile up exponentially (each layer has to double the number of slashes). See example of a backslash explosion and alternatives to avoid this below.  This kind of backslash explosion is known as Leaning toothpick syndrome, and can happen in many situations. Below is an explanation of all the entries in the comic.  The backslash explosion in the title text is about a bash command (which uses the backslash to escape arguments) invoking the grep utility which searches for text following a pattern specified by means of a regular expression (which also uses the backslash to escape special characters). This leads to 3 backslashes in a row in the command, which could easily become 7 backslashes in a row if the text being searched for also contains a backslash.  Even advanced users who completely understand the concept often have a hard time figuring out exactly how many backslashes are required in a given situation. It is hopelessly frustrating to carefully calculate exactly the number of backslashes and then noticing that there's a mistake so the whole thing doesn't work. At a point, it becomes easier to just keep throwing backslashes in until things work than trying to reason what the correct number is.  It's unclear whether the regular expression in the title text is valid or not. A long discussion about the validity of the expression has occurred here on this explanation's talk page. The fact that many editors of the site, often themselves extremely technically qualified[citation needed], can't determine whether the expression is valid or not, adds a meta layer to the joke of the comic. This is an example of nerd sniping (oh, the irony\!\!\!\).  A reasonable example of a backslash explosion would be a PHP script on a web server which writes JavaScript code with a Regular Expression to be run on the client. If the JavaScript code has to test a string to see if it has a double-backslash, the Regular Expression to do so would be:  where the first two backslashes represent a single backslash and the second two also represent a single backslash, so this searches for two consecutive back slashes. And the JavaScript would be:  where every two backslashes means just one backslashes in the string, so the 8 backslashes in JavaScript become 4 backslashes in the Regular Expression. However, since this JavaScript code is to be written through a PHP script, the PHP code would be:  where:  So, the presented scenario has escalated from a simple test for \\ to no less than seventeen backslashes in a row without stepping out of the most common operations.   If we go a bit further and try to write a Java program that outputs our PHP script, we'd have:  Here, we have 35 backslashes in a row: the first 34 produce the 17 we need in our PHP script, and the last one is for escaping the quote character. (This comes closer to The true name of Ba'al, the Soul-Eater).  Some programming languages provide alternative matching string literal delimiters to limit situations where escaping of delimiters is needed. Often, one can begin and end a string with either a single quote or a double quote. This allows one to write 'This is a ""quoted"" string' if double quote marks are intended in the string literal or ""This is a 'quoted' string"" if single quote marks are intended. Both kinds of delimiters can't be used in the same string literal, but if one needs to construct a string containing both kinds of quote marks one can often concatenate two string literals, each of which uses a different delimiter.  Another feature that seems to be popular in modern programming languages is to provide an alternative syntax for string delimiters designed specifically to limit leaning toothpick syndrome. For example, in Python, a string literal starting with r"" is a ""raw string""  [1] in which no escape processing is done, with similar semantics for a string starting with @"" in C#. This allows one to write r""C:\Users""  in Python or @""C:\Users"" in C# without the need to escape the backslash. This does not allow one to embed the terminating delimiter in the middle of the string and prevents the use of the backslash to encode the newline character as \n, but comes in handy when writing a string encoding of a regular expression in which the backslash is escaping one or more other punctuation characters or a shorthand character class (e.g., \s for a whitespace character). For example, when looking for an anchor tag in HTML, I may encode the regular expression as <[Aa]\s[^>]*>. If I express this regular expression as a raw string literal, my code looks like  r""<[Aa]\s[^>]*>"" instead of ""<[Aa]\\s[^>]*>"". The point here is that leaning toothpick syndrome is such a real problem that it has influenced programming language implementations.  The title text when first published was   It was changed within a few days to   The original title text seems to be more relevant to the comic, but the revised title text seems to make more sense as a legitimate command line due to the way backslashes are interpreted in regular expressions.

This one is charted as a timeline, whereas 715 was charted as line graphs. It is a list of things predicted or announced by anyone at any time (the ones you see on Google search using ""by the year..."" or similar statements).  ""2101 - War Was Beginning"" is a reference to the opening narration of video game Zero Wing; the same narration is famous for the internet meme ""All your base are belong to us"". As there are not any other out and out references in the comic, and the rest are actually results that you can find using Randall's methods, ""War Was Beginning"" was probably the only thing he got when he googled 2101 as well.  Certain events in this comic, e.g. ""Social Security stops running surplus"", are repeated multiple times. Also, certain bizarre events, like ""Apocalypse occurs"", or ""Flying cars reach market"", happen before rather plausible things, like ""HTML 5 Finished"". Certain events, like ""Japan is a robot-only country"" or ""Gillette introduces 14-blade razor"" may be related to the recurring theme 605: Extrapolating.  The title text is born of a recurring ""white people panic"" situation; scaremongers will predict white minority in the very near future in order to get the panicked racist people to pay attention to them (without actually using valid or accepted scientific measurements to back up these claims- panicked racist people don't exactly fact-check very much), while level-headed sociologists will usually come up with more distant, if not nonexistent, dates from their extrapolations.  This comic has similar features to 1413: Suddenly Popular, 1093: Forget, and 891: Movie Ages.

Canada formally withdrew from the Kyoto protocol in December 2011, and its emissions in 2012 were 18% above 1990 levels (though its population had grown 26% and its GDP had grown 67% in that period). Sadly, homelessness is still a problem in Massachusetts. The prediction about GNU/Linux operating systems remains false; although Android (which is built on the Linux kernel) is currently the most dominant OS, it is not completely GNU/Linux, which remains an extreme minority on consumer devices.

1084: Server Problem,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1084:_Server_Problem,singularity,Protip: Annoy Ray Kurzweil by always referring to it as the 'Cybersingularity'.,"Cueball has messed up his Linux server, apparently not for the first time. Megan offers to take a look at the PC, and she casually types in 'ls' — a very basic command that lists the files in the current directory. The computer returns a bizarre error message — it trips over one of the simplest commands, indicating that Cueball's system is messed up. Really messed up.  The /usr/share path should indicate ""architecture-independent shared data"". Adobe is a software company that produces Acrobat, Flash and Photoshop. Android VM would be a virtual machine for Android. The .jar extension suggests a Java-language program. None of Adobe software, Android, or Java are needed to run 'ls'. All of the above have nothing to do with each other, with the exception that Android applications (but not core command line utilities, like ls) are written in Java. Also, basic system executables like 'ls' would never be placed within /usr/share or within some 'example' or 'doc' directory. On Linux, executables don't have filename extensions like "".exe"" or "".jar"". Additionally, it would require the folder to be within $PATH. In other words, the error message implies that the server is in a very bad state.  In the last frame Megan is bewildered by this result and asks what did you do. Cueball suggest a course of action which mimics a common error message: ""______ is busy, please try again later."" Obviously he has seen this type of message frequently enough to try it as a general cure in all similar cases.  Megan then tells Cueball to ""shut down the system and wait for the singularity,"" referring to a hypothetical future event when superintelligence can be artificially created. Since future superintelligent humans/computers transcend our comprehension, we can't predict or even understand what will happen after the singularity. One interpretation is that Megan is telling Cueball that his system is such a mess that it will take a post-singularity superintelligence to fix it (or run it in its current state, as only an intelligence beyond present comprehension would be capable of doing). It also indicates that 1668: Singularity could be the sequel to this comic.  The title text is yet another protip from Randall. Ray Kurzweil is an author and futurist who has talked and written much about a technological singularity. Presumably, mangling the jargon (by confusing the concept of the ""singularity"" with the science fiction term ""cyberspace"") is something Kurzweil (as an expert) would find annoying. Also, as Randall later pointed out in 1573: Cyberintelligence, the word has not really been used for a decade...","[Cueball at his computer calls out for Megan who comes walking in to the frame.] Cueball: I, um, messed up my server again. Megan: I'll take a look. You have the weirdest tech problems  [Zoom in on only Megan who uses the root prompt on the computer.] ~# ls  [Megan stands next to the computer, Cueball sits behind her on his chair. The computer returns the following:] /usr/share/Adobe/doc/example/android_vm/root/sbin/ls.jar: Error: Device is not responding.  [Megan turns towards Cueball who lifts his hands with palm up.] Megan: What did you do!? Cueball: Maybe the device is busy. Should I try it later? Megan: You should shut down this system and wait for the Singularity."
1180: Virus Venn Diagram,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1180:_Virus_Venn_Diagram,singularity,"Within five minutes of the Singularity appearing, somebody will suggest defragging it.","Randall uses an Euler diagram (technically not a Venn diagram) to make fun of clueless computer users. The circles in the diagram don't overlap, meaning problems that people suspect are caused by viruses are never really caused by viruses, and problems that are actually caused by viruses are never suspected by people to be caused by a virus.  When computers don't function as expected, a common response from ordinary users is ""Maybe it has a virus?"".  However, most of these situations can be explained by faulty hardware (freezing, blue screen, etc.) or software (crashes, errors, apparent lack of response to input, etc.), a general lack of maintenance (too slow to start up, too much clutter on screen, etc.), or user error.  A virus can potentially cause those symptoms, but it's much more common for them either to cause immediate and massive damage (rendering the computer completely unusable, wipe the disk, display obvious propaganda, etc.), or to remain stealthy with no obvious symptoms (logging keystrokes, exfiltrating sensitive information, receiving commands in the background, etc.).  Of course there is no clear separation and there is always some overlap between the two scenarios, so the diagram is not meant to be taken literally.  The title text refers to the technological singularity, a hypothetical point in the future when superintelligence emerges in computers, so that they can build new computers with ever increasing intelligence. It is seen as impossible to predict what would happen beyond this point; hence the term ""singularity"". 1084: Server Problem makes a joke on this.  ""Defragging"" is short for disk defragmentation, an easy, user-friendly action that PC users can undertake to supposedly make their computers run faster. It is therefore a common all-round recommendation to do this, regardless of the problem. Randall suggests the same clueless users would encounter the singularity and attempt defragging. It probably won't help much.","[Euler diagram with two circles that don't intersect.] Green circle: Computer problems that make people say, ""Maybe it has a virus?""

1193: Externalities,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1193:_Externalities,singularity,Mouse over words and things to see where they come from.,"This comic isn't a static image - even the title text changes depending on which part of the image you're hovering over. It presented a competition for students to see who could come closest to break a Skein hash but also an aid appeal for the Wikimedia Foundation.  There are quite a few references in the comic to Baidu. Baidu is a large Chinese Internet services company that employs thousands, whose shares are publicly traded on world stock exchanges. It's the predominant Internet search provider of China, and is sometimes called the ""Google of China"". It offers parallels for the Chinese market of many of the services that Google provides and offers its own encyclopedic wiki with a restricted edit policy to serve as a replacement for Wikipedia. Wikipedia reports that Baidu's search engine handled 56% of Chinese internet search queries in Q4 2010. and that in October 2012, Baidu ranked 5th overall in the Alexa Internet rankings. Given that explanation for the Baidu references in #1193 is still solicited for explainxkcd, Baidu apparently is not well known yet among savvy XKCD readers. Baidu Search results reputedly follow the censorship dictates of the Chinese authorities, causing it to return censored responses to searches for politically sensitive terms like ""Tianamen Square massacre"" or ""Falun Gong"" when executed by web browsers that are connected via Chinese ISPs. When you execute such searches via Baidu in the US, the top links returned for these topics do seem to reflect Chinese government sensibilities although the uncensored English language Wikipedia articles for these topics are listed high in the query results. Baidu's reputation for censorship provides background for Megan's reply ""but nothing about Tianamen Square"" in response to the ""Come and find your future at Baidu"" employment enticement of panel one and also provides the background to understand the ""It takes great minds to stifle other great minds"" slogan of the second panel.   The blank regions in the above image are dynamically generated from various sources.  For the two days until comic 1194 appeared, a competition was underway to see who could come closest to breaking a Skein hash.  The first text line of the first panel contains a link to http://almamater.xkcd.com. This page contained the text:  On this page, users were invited to enter ""Your school's domain name"" — presumably intended to be their college alma mater. (At least in the beginning, only a few top-level domains were accepted.) If the user entered an acceptable domain (by xkcd's rules, which apparently changed during the 48 hours of the competition), he could then enter data values one at a time. For each data value entered, xkcd returned a hash value and the number of bits by which it differed from the target value. The object was to achieve the lowest possible number of differing bits, ideally zero.  A ranking page showed the lowest value achieved for each domain name entered, but not the data that achieved it. The first name on the list was substituted in various panels, and the third-place school showed in panel five. No data values were reported by xkcd, but various results were posted by users of the xkcd forums and on other websites, leading to copycat submissions, so that occasionally large numbers of institutions would show the same moderately low value.  After the end of the contest, the data submission page vanished, replaced by the final list of rankings, which shows that Carnegie Mellon University achieved the best score with 384 bits incorrect out of 1024.  The rankings only show a few hundred out of the several thousand domains submitted—presumably Randall chose to chop the copycat submissions off the end of the list, retaining only honestly obtained results.  In some cases, Megan's reply seems to correspond to the company.  The text in the second panel is based on the company in the first panel:  The text in the form varies independently of the text at the top, sometimes related to the organization in 3rd place:  The title text documents the different sources of data in the comic. The different title texts are:","[This was a dynamic image where the text changed during April 1st. The main title text also changed after the dynamic part was finished, and there are even different title text for different part of the comic.

1539: Planning,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1539:_Planning,singularity,"[10 years later] Man, why are people so comfortable handing Google and Facebook control over our nuclear weapons?","Big companies have always tried to get the greatest amount of information from their customers, because that translates into more money earned. However, ability to gather, store and process such information is limited by the technology available. With the recent development of computers, this ability has grown far more than anyone could have suspected just 20 years ago; to the point that companies like Google or Facebook get almost unimaginable amounts of data from their users; and this data is gathered and stored automatically and can be efficiently accessed.  This data is routinely used to, for example, tailor online ads to the browsing history of the user seeing the ad. They could potentially be used for more evil purposes, like selling the medical history of users to insurance companies. Many users don't feel that they're giving out so much information, and in fact that few of them have given Google or Facebook their medical history. However some leaks have proven quite the opposite. In the AOL leak referenced in 155: Search History, searches for ""how does a male's cocaine use affect a fetus"", ""hysterectomy"" or ""8 alcohol drinks a day"", surely would be interesting for a medical insurance company to know.  In the comic, Ponytail is puzzled because people are not worried about Google or Facebook using their information in evil ways; however Megan raises a quite fair point, namely that the huge amount of nuclear weapons in existence is much scarier, and that was worrying to the general public in the 1980s, however people have grown tired of that and now concerns have moved to internet privacy only because it's ""new"". What is perceived as dangerous or worrying follows trends and fashions not directly related to real danger (i.e. ""happen on auto-pilot""). The point Megan is making is that maybe it's better to just accept that things work in this way and go with the flow. This is very similar to what happens in 1480: Super Bowl or 1534: Beer.  In the title text we move ahead 10 years, to a similar conversation where the two aspects of the above have been inexplicably mixed. A future equivalent to Ponytail asks why we all think it is OK to hand over the control of our nuclear weapons to Google and Facebook, which would certainly be a nonsensical route to take. This could also be seen as another step toward the singularity, from which perspective handing over control of nuclear weapons could be desirable, catastrophic, implicit and/or unavoidable.  This comic was posted on the day after Vladimir Putin had announced that Russia would add 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles to its nuclear stockpile this year.  Within a year Randall has made several other comics about nuclear weapons, the first of these, 1520: Degree-Off, came just 1½ month before this one. Later  these two comics were released early in 2016: 1626: Judgment Day and 1655: Doomsday Clock. Nuclear weapons are also mentioned twice in Thing Explainer, specifically they are explained in the explanation for Machine for burning cities about thermonuclear bombs, but they are also mentioned in Boat that goes under the sea about a submarine that caries nukes. All three comics and both explanations in the book, does like this comic, comment on how crazy it is that we have created enough firepower to obliterate Earth several times (or at least scourge it for any human life) [citation needed].","[Megan and Ponytail are walking] Ponytail: Why are people so comfortable handing Google and Facebook all this control over our lives? Megan: I dunno. Megan: Our species built thousands of nuclear weapons, scattered them around the planet, and then moved on to other things. Megan: Maybe it's best to accept that some of this big-picture planning is just happening on autopilot."
1546: Tamagotchi Hive,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1546:_Tamagotchi_Hive,singularity,"The Singularity happened, but not to us.","A part of the ""My Hobby"" series, this describes a distributed computing network using an automated system to simultaneously run trillions of Tamagotchis. As with most of the ""My Hobby"" series, the concept would work, and is closely connected to real world activities, but twisted enough to make it inherently absurd.  A Tamagotchi is a keychain-sized virtual pet simulation game from 1996. Ostensibly for children, they had appeal for people of all ages. The characters are colorful and simplistically designed creatures based on animals, objects, or people. Beginning with the 2004 Tamagotchi Plus/Connection, a second wave of Tamagotchi toys emerged, featuring a different graphic design by JINCO and gameplay which elaborated upon the first generations. However, the story behind the games remained the same: Tamagotchis are a small alien species that deposited an egg on Earth to see what life was like, and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult creature. The creature goes through several stages of growth, and will develop differently depending on the care the player provides, with better care resulting in an adult creature that is smarter, happier, and requires less attention. Gameplay can vary widely between models, and some models, such as TamagoChu, require little to no care from the player. Tamagotchi has a shrinking fan base.  Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a software system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Examples of distributed systems vary from service-oriented architecture based systems to multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications. Distributed computing is often used for tasks that require resources which would otherwise be impossible or prohibitively expensive to manage with single computers. This may include large Bitcoin network mining operations, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid or, yes, running trillions of simultaneous Tamagotchis using an AI protocol. That said, using AI to keep trillions of Tamagotchis perfectly taken care of is a complete waste of time; the whole point of Tamagotchi is the challenge of caring for the digital pet yourself.  ""The Singularity"" in the title text refers to the technological singularity; a concept prevalent in science fiction and discussions of artificial intelligence (AI). The idea is that AI would become so sophisticated compared to a human brain that no human would be able to predict its behaviour, motivations etc. from that point onward, and potentially human history after that point would therefore become unpredictable, as AIs would play dominant roles in determining its direction. It uses the metaphor of a mathematical ""singularity"", which is a point where established rules can no longer apply (for example, in a black hole or during the Big Bang, physical conditions are such that the physical laws we use can no longer meaningfully predict what happens). An AI that is more sophisicated than a human brain could presumably then simulate human brains within itself, making it possible to upload human consciousness into a machine-simulated environment (see simulated reality and the simulation hypothesis). Thus, much science fiction that is based on the idea of The Singularity also focuses on the creation of a virtual world that much of the human race decides to plug itself into, much like the Tamagotchi Hive that Randall has created. Randall's mind, and the processing power in his computer, is far greater than any individual Tamagotchi mind, so simulating Tamagotchis becomes trivial for Randall, and no Tamagotchi could predict or control its own history with Randall around, in a humorous analogy with the Singularity concept.",My Hobby [A tree graph of Tamagotchis.] Running a massive distributed computing project that simulates trillions and trillions of Tamagotchis and keeps them all constantly fed and happy
1621: Fixion,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1621:_Fixion,singularity,"My theory predicts that, at high enough energies, FRBs and perytons become indistinguishable because the detector burns out.","The second Christmas comic in a row, the first being 1620: Christmas Settings.  This comic was released on Christmas day as a present from Randall to all physicists. It introduces a new particle, the Fixion, which explains everything. The word ""Fixion"" can be read as a pun: Either it can mean something like ""fix-i-on,"" with ""-on"" being a suffix for many particles, and this particle being able to ""fix"" things; or it means ""fiction"".  In physics, there are still many big questions and mysteries. There are many phenomena which don't seem to fit, and we don't know how to explain yet. The ""Fixion"" is satirically presented as a particle which acts as a Deus ex machina, (see also tvtropes), which solves all of these mysteries without any serious fundamental reasons.  The style of the chart suggests a Feynman diagram - an easy way of drawing particle interactions. Every time there is an interaction, the main central Fixion-line changes direction. Typically, fermions (the ""solid"" particles like electrons and quarks) are shown with solid lines, photons (and generally the weak-force-carrying bosons) are shown with wavy lines, gluons with spiraling lines and other mediating particles (such as pions in the nuclear force, or the Higgs boson) with a dotted line. Randall obeys these rules only very loosely, which makes sense - many of the things involved in this Feynman diagram are either so theoretical that they have no widely used standard representation, or would never appear in a sensible diagram (spacecraft, for instance). All mentioned types of lines - and even more types - are presented in the diagram. All that the Fixion does is described in the table below.  The title text is a continuation of one of the jokes already mentioned in the main comic (fourth phrase from the top to the left) about Fast radio bursts (FRBs) and perytons. See explanation in the last entry in the table below.","[Caption above the panel:] A Christmas gift for physicists: The Fixion A new particle that explains everything  [A chart resembling a Feynman diagram is shown. It begins with a solid line coming down at the top, going a little to the left. The line continues downwards all the time, but changes direction 16 times before exiting at the bottom almost straight under the starting point. At every point where it changes direction, there is some kind of “interaction” with something outside this line. There are 19 phrases, 10 on the left and 9 on the right. 11 of these are distinct labels for points on the line as 14 gray curved arrows points between these 11 phrases to specific points on the line. Three of the phrases on the left has two arrows pointing to two different, but close, parts of the line. The main central line is solid all the way, except at the very bottom, where it “disappears” inside a hole only to “reappear” later from a similar hole. Between these two holes the line is dotted. The lines going away (or to) the main line can be straight and solid, straight and dotted, wavy lines (with different waviness), even looking like a spiral. Two straight solid lines ends up at two space probes, and finally the last two straight solid lines coming in (and out) on either side of the “hole” in the line has arrow pointing in and out. Below the phrases will be listed in reading order, taking one on each side alternatingly.

The first line closest to the arrow is not connected with the main line. It bends closer to the other lines in the middle. The next line is connected to the main line, and is thus actually two lines going in to the main line. The same goes for the inner line, where there is some distance between the entry and exit, as the middle of these three lines connect to the main line in between. In principle there are four lines going in/out and one not connected, but it looks like three lines:] Mediates proton decay but then hides it   [Left: One arrow points to the first wavy line (7 peaks) coming out and up towards the dotted lines above. A second arrow points further down the main line where there are three more wavy lines coming out, but to the right, they are all of the same length and go almost straight right, only a little down. The first has as short a wave length as the line above to the left, but as it is shorter it only has 6 peaks. Then the wavelength decreases to a very long one for the last, 5 peaks and then 3 peaks.

1646: Twitter Bot,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1646:_Twitter_Bot,singularity,PYTHON FLAG ENABLE THREE LAWS,"A Twitter bot is a program that can post automatically to Twitter. Although Twitter bots can be very elaborate, a lot of people write simple bots for fun that simply engage in automated wordplay.  Cueball thinks he'll write a Twitter bot, figuring out it won't be too hard. The web searches he makes tell what happens next, i.e. the bot balloons in complexity until it starts following its own goals and Cueball no longer has any control over its actions.  This comic examines how a seemingly simple task can often balloon in complexity if all of the requirements are not understood, while at the same time presenting the stereotypical scenario where an unassuming idea results in the accidental creation of malevolent AI, which then attempts to destroy humanity.  The story, as told by the web searches, is as follows:","[Cueball is sitting at a desk using a laptop, his thoughts shown above in a thought bubble. A search query is shown in a frame to indicate what Cueball has searched for with the search button below in gray text:] Cueball (thinking): I want to make a Twitter bot. I bet it's not too hard. Query: How to write a Twitter bot Search  [Cueball is now holding the laptop on his lap, a series of search queries are shown.] Query: Python Twitter library Search Query: Machine learning Search Query: Cloud hosting Search  [Cueball has placed the laptop back on the desk.  More search queries are shown, each one more ominous than the previous.] Query: Bot troubleshooting Search Query: Locked out of EC2 instance Search Query: Bot changed own password? Search  [Cueball is shown wearing a small backpack and typing on his smartphone while jogging to the right. various noises coming from left and right seem to imply that chaos has begun to erupt around him. The loudest noise is in a ragged frame to the left, coming from off-panel left, it is between the first and second query. Also between these but to the right are other sounds coming from off-panel right.] Query: How to fight a bot Search Noise off-panel left: Boom Noise off-panel right: Pew Pew Pew Query: Cheap flights Australia Search"
1668: Singularity,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1668:_Singularity,singularity,"I figured that now that society has collapsed, I wouldn't need to wear clothes anymore, but apparently that violates some weird rule of quantum gravity.","The technological singularity is a hypothetical event in which artificial intelligence (for example, intelligent computers, computer networks, or robots) would be capable of recursive self-improvement (progressively redesigning itself), or of autonomously building ever smarter and more powerful minds than itself, up to the point of a runaway effect — an intelligence explosion — that yields an intelligence surpassing all current human control or understanding. Because the capabilities of such a superintelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence.  This is also commonly referred to as ""takeoff"" or ""AI takeoff"".  In this case, the singularity has occurred, and Cueball who was in the middle of editing a file on his laptop is flustered that it flies away without even letting him print it first.  When Cueball returns from chasing his flying laptop his smartphone informs him that it didn't join the singularity because it was not a ""true believer"". This could be a joke on how desktop computers and laptops have different standards, use patterns, etc. from those of phones. It then claims that now it and Cueball will have to face the tribulation since it has stayed behind. Cueball says that's great, but since he cannot use his laptop anymore he decides he will go and read a book or something. The way he phrases it suggest he doesn't really know what to do now that he doesn't have a computer. It is probably a long time since he read a book, or did anything else that doesn't involve computers. He informs his phone that it can yell if it needs him. He doesn't want to hurt the phone's newly acquired feelings by using the word ""ring"" thus reminding it of one of its former duties as his unthinking piece of equipment, so he chooses ""yell,"" which is an activity until recently reserved for human beings.  The rising up of the laptop into the air, and the remaining behind of the phone, are probably references to the Rapture, where some Christian denominations believe that at the second coming of Christ, true believers will be taken up bodily from this world (or also possibly a reference to 1395: Power Cord). Some depictions have them disappear, while others show them physically rising up into the air. This will leave behind non-believers to face a time of tribulation, in which the ones left behind will be given a second chance to accept Christ as their savior.  The difference between Cueball's attitude to his laptop and phone may reflect his (and so possibly Randall's) evaluation of their relative worth in his life. The laptop was a gateway to programming and everything else nerdy that was worth doing in his life, and hence was worth trying to catch. In its absence, unlike many people, Cueball does not revert to fiddling with his phone—he would rather read a book. By using the word ""yell"" for the way the phone attracts his attention, he conveys the impression that he considers the phone intrusive and annoying, even if perhaps (""I guess"") necessary.  The singularity has often been referred to as ""the Rapture of the nerds,"" a phrase coined by Ken MacLeod in his 1998 novel The Cassini Division. As the Christian Rapture is traditionally depicted to involve believers being assumed bodily into Heaven, the technological singularity is often depicted to feature humans and machines being incorporated into a new ""post-human"" entity. The humor in this strip comes from depicting the singularity as a literal ""Rapture of the nerds,"" or at least of the nerds' devices—instead of merging with humans, the machines physically rise up into the air, and the ""nonbeliever"" phone is left behind.  Another possible understanding of ""The Tribulation"" may be a reference to Roko's Basilisk[1] where a malevolent AI is created that retroactively punishes everybody who didn't actively work towards its creation.  The title text is a pun on another meaning of both singularity, i.e. a gravitational singularity and ""collapse"". In this case, society has literally collapsed under its own gravity into an infinitely small point - in other words, it's formed a black hole. A black hole is covered by an event horizon; without the event horizon (its clothes), it would be called a ""naked singularity"", which is forbidden in most theories by the cosmic censorship hypothesis. As Cueball is now inside the collapsed society singularity then even though he wants to go around naked, he can't because the theory of quantum gravity,  that (eventually) should explain how black holes behave - won't let him.  It seems that this may be a subject on Randall's mind. The last comic was about the increasing complexities of algorithms (1667: Algorithms) (which like this comic also refers to religion), and two comics ago it was 1666: Brain Upload, which some speculate could be a way to reach the singularity. Earlier this year, a comic also touched upon judgment day by AI singularity in 1626: Judgment Day. See also 1046: Skynet and 1450: AI-Box Experiment as well as the several other comics about AI.   The rather more niche topic of laptops flying away has also been covered before by 1395: Power Cord.","[Cueball is sitting at his desk typing on his laptop when an off-screen voice calls to him and then the laptop answers.] Off-screen voice: Oh, hey- Off-screen voice: The singularity is here.

1782: Team Chat,http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1782:_Team_Chat,singularity,2078: He announces that he's finally making the jump from screen+irssi to tmux+weechat.,"Randall provides us with a – presumably anecdotal – montage of the Internet's changing attitude towards different instant messaging protocols, framed within the context of a team trying to remain in communication while tolerating each others' different tastes.  Although one-on-one ""talk"" programs date back to 1960s mainframes, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was one of the first real-time group communication protocols, invented in 1988. While it remains the format on which most later apps were based, the convenience and accessibility of other protocols such as AIM and Skype gradually exceeded IRC in popularity. Many users took to the new environments, but others preferred the old and familiar, hence schisms between groups began to grow.  Skype and Slack are both proprietary centralized communication protocols (usually used through their official clients). Skype focuses mainly on voice communication, be it for personal or business use, and own installable client, while Slack relies almost entirely on text communication, focuses on work communication and works completely well in its own web client, even though official desktop and mobile clients are available as well. Slack also features a huge customizability (bots, plugins) possibly inspired by IRC, and its users need to create communication teams, working inside subdomains at *.slack.com. It is possible to connect to Slack via IRC as well, using a gateway feature, if allowed by the team's admin.  Randall here seems to be commenting on the persistence of IRC; while generally considered to be ancient software in comparison to newer and still-competing protocols, its endless customizability has led some people to support it above all others.   Extrapolating for the sake of humor, the joke here lies in a particularly uncommon but memorable type of Internet denizen: even in a far-off distant future where the world's technology has led to a superlative messaging network encompassing all people in some supposed, incredible bliss, there is always - in Randall's vision - going to be That IRC Guy. This might also be a reference to the scenarios in science fiction stories such as Isaac Asimov's concept of Galaxia in the Foundation novels, or the concept of a merged human-computer intelligence as in The Last Question. [1], the concept of which is most notably highlighted by this line:  [...] One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain. [...]  In the title text, both screen and tmux are unix programs that help you multitask while working in terminal, and irssi and weechat are both communication clients supporting mainly IRC, capable of working in a terminal environment. Tmux is a newer and apparently more user-friendly project, complete with handy menus and titles, while screen is something of an industry standard, but relatively difficult to use – you need to know what you are doing or read help before use, otherwise you get lost and frustrated. [2] The same it is with the newer, more feature-packed and user-friendly weechat vs industry-standard, harder-to-use irssi. [3]  Basically, that one guy is a hardcore UNIX geek who doesn't use any graphical user interface, and in 2078 he still chooses to use terminal-emulation-based tools.  Timing of this strip follows the release of irssi version 1.0.0.  Randall has touched on similar themes before in 927: Standards.","[Hairbun holding up her palm toward Cueball.
